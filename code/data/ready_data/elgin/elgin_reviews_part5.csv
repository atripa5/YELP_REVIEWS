They were all very good. The fried rice had a little too much soy sauce, but it may have just been enough not to add more soy sauce. It was tasty, no matter what.

The delivery time was very reasonable at about 20 to 30 minutes, as was the price. I will be trying more dishes from this restaurant."

They tried to first tell us it was traffic but we only live about 12 minutes away,  approx. 6.8 miles.
Apparently they are under new ownership and no one there speaks English. 
Food was cold..noodles were supposed to be crispy but was like spaghetti because they absorbed all the sauce.
We were very patient with them but they showed no sympathy for the fact they messed up. 
Sorry to say i will never order from here again."

My delivery time was 7:26-7:36. My food didn&#39;t arrive until  8:08, more than 30 minutes late and very cold. I called the restaurant and they apologized but didn&#39;t offer anything. I said that I would need a refund as they were way outside the delivery time, I was very hungry and everything had to be microwaved. They offered a credit for the next visit and would not give me a refund. I called grub hub, who was very kind and said that they would give me a refund if the restaurant did not. The restaurant refused and grub hub kindly refunded me and gave me wonderful customer service. On to the food: the taro bubble tea tasted as it should. The chicken lo mein was flavorless. I had never had this low of quality at an Asian buffet. There was no seasoning, it was like eating plain spaghetti noodles with my chicken. The shrimp wonton soup base was in a separate container from the wontons. The base was intolerably salty. The wontons were all mushed together with two random thin noodles that didn&#39;t belong. There was almost no shrimp in them even though they cost more than other varieties of wontons. The cold boring food and customer service from the restaurant was a huge disappointment. I would have been even more upset if I had accepted the credit as I never want to eat food from here again. I have had so much Asian food and have never had anything so subpar."

Wow!!!!! Everything we got was still steaming hot when it was delivered! We got the following dishes: 


BBQ pork fried rice : tasted great, my boyfriend needed a little more soy sauce but for me it was just right

Mongolian beef: best Mongolian we&#39;ve had from a Chinese place!!!! The vegetables tasted fresh not frozen the beef tasted fresh! My favorite so far, it also did have a little spice factor to it which we enjoyed!!!

General Taos chicken: also great! The sauce sits at the bottom so make sure to stir well! Had great flavor chicken tasted fresh!

Chicken with black bean sauce: my favorite !!!!!! Such fresh, crunchy vegetables!!!! And the sauce and chicken were amazing!!!



Overall, this Chinese restaurant has been one of the best we have tried! We&#39;ve never received this many food for the price and not to mention the freshness! Will definitely order again and recommend!!"

I&#39;m pleased to say, we&#39;ve finally found the next best in the area! I recommend the mango tapioca. 

Oh yea, their food is alright, too.

Just kidding! We had Mongolian chicken, which we ordered extra spicy, and it was perfect. Crab Rangoon was pretty bland, so I&#39;d skip that next time. Same with the barbecue pork. I think I was expecting Filipino style barbecue pork, so was obviously disappointed with the chewy red mess they served, but that&#39;s my fault for having my porks confused. I think I read that their chicken fried rice is delightful, so I will add that onto my list of dishes to try next time I need my tapioca smoothie."

The always empty dining room kinda threw me off the first few times. The food is really good. But we made the mistake of eating there last night. I had 1 serving of my noodles and of course asked for the rest of it to be wrapped up (yay lunch tomorrow), they brought our food into the kitchen to wrap it up. Which I&#39;m not a huge fan of, but ok. When they brought it back out, most of it had disappeared. When I asked the waitress what happened to the rest of it, she said that was all that was left. I told her no, there was a lot left it wouldn&#39;t have fit in the tiny little box they gave me. She continued to argue and then walked away. Only time someone came back was to get our money. 

No we are sorry we dropped it or ran out of bigger boxes nothing. This really is a shame as the food is good and this place is less than 5 minutes away. Time to find another place."

I was in the area &amp; was looking for a good Chinese restaurant that was close so I pulled out my trusted Yelp App &amp; found this place.  This place was definitely a good find.  It is in a little strip mall next to a Subway.  The parking lot is a decent size but the parking right of front next to the door can be full at times.  

I was surprised when I walked inside at how big it was &amp; how many tables they had.  It was very spacious &amp; the tables were spaced about with lots of room.  I came around lunch time.  I ordered a Mongolian beef &amp; it came with fried rice &amp; a soup.  For my soup I had the choice of egg drop or hot &amp; sour.  I went with the hot &amp; sour &amp; it was very good.  Some places taste a little bit too sour but this place was more on the hot side which I liked a lot.  

After about ten minutes the Mongolian beef came out.  It was piping hot which was a big plus &amp; you could tell it was brought to the table promptly after it was finished cooking.  The portion was a good size &amp; the food was delicious.  The fried rice that came with the food was also very good.  

The service here was very good &amp; the people who were running the place were also very nice.  I decided to come here again &amp; the second experience was just as good.  

Overall the food was delicious &amp; the service was very good.  I would definitely eat here again if I was in the area."

I was watching a show that had Chinese food on it and then had a craving for it. Looked on yelp what was around, and this was the best rated one. Never heard of it and realized that it was very new, just about a week open when I went there on a Sunday afternoon. I&#39;d give this play 4 stars for the food which I&#39;ll explain later, but bumped it up to 5 because of our waitress.

Doesn&#39;t look like a traditional Chinese restaurant, but it&#39;s such a big open room, not sure what else they could do with it. For the food, we got dumplings, egg drop soup, Mongolian beef, and shrimp fried rice. Dumplings were alright, different style than other traditional places. The small egg drop soup is a great deal for the price. A small was big enough for 2 people. The Mongolian beef was pretty good and same with the shrimp friend rice. Made for a good leftover meal later on that day too.

Our waitress was really nice, and tea is free too. She even wondered if we didn&#39;t like the food since we had so much left over but really, we just don&#39;t eat a lot. So that&#39;s really nice on her part. Got some coupons for next time that she gave us too."

Once it was delivery, the second time was carry out. The day we ordered delivery we were told 30 min but it actually was delivered in 15. Only complaint was that the person taking the order did not speak english very well. My bf had to repeat the order and address many times until she got it right.  Well we ordered a beef and scallop dish and we got the dish we ordered minus the scallops. She placed the wrong order.  It wasnt a big deal since the dish was very good and had a nice spice  to it.  We also ordered beef fried rice that was very good and not greasy like others I&#39;ve tasted.  The best part of the meal was my melon soothie. It was delicious!  Sweet, refreshing and yummy! 
Second time we ordered carry out. I ordered beef lo mein and my bf got the chicken szechwan and he ordered it very spicy, very spicy it was.  He was extremely happy with it, the portion was huge and the price decent. My dish was good, I loved the noodles. We are very happy with this place. We will make this a regular spot for us."

We typically order from Lom Lings in Lombard or Jins and China Ho in Winfield, but China Chef is geographically closer so we figured let&#39;s give it a shot. We were very glad we did. From time of order to food bagged and ready to go was 11 minutes.  We ordered 3 basic, chinese restaurant staples: Mongolian Beef, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce and General Tso&#39;s Chicken.

Mongolian Beef: Flavorful with a bit of heat, nice sized portion and not drowning in gravy like other places treat this dish.

Shrimp in Lobster Sauce: First, I give them props for not skimping on the Shrimp and unlike the Mongolian Beef, they went heavy with this awesome egg, lobster and bean sauce which was very tasty. 

General Tso&#39;s Chicken: Where&#39;s the breading? A lot of places put a heavy batter on their chicken so the ratio of bread to chicken is 2:1.. NOT here.. They again served a good sized portion of lightly battered chicken and veggies for flavor. They didn&#39;t  over douse the chicken in sauce either. It was just the right amount.

My opinion, so far much better than all the surrounding Chinese take-out. This is a place you should try. Next time we&#39;ll try delivery and 4 new dishes..."

At least I have 1 reliable place that seems to have pretty decent staples...more importantly, for smoothies that they will DELIVER to you. If you&#39;re curious, the cup of smoothie is delivered in a small brown paper bag. Dunno what they do if you order more than one. If you do pick-up order, they&#39;ll make it when you arrive (unless you request otherwise, I assume). As you watch them make it, you can also be really confused &amp; surprised that the interior is actually really nice.

Food I&#39;ve tried so far:
One of their egg foo youngs: It&#39;s not bad. It&#39;s ordered for family members, so...yeah. It&#39;s not any different from any other places, really.
Orange chicken: It&#39;s actually slight hot/has &#34;heat&#34;, opposed to straight up sweetness. It&#39;s still too sweet for my tastes, though.
Sesame chicken: Would 100% order again always. The sauce stays on the bottom of the container, so definitely spoon some on top when getting your food.
Chicken &amp; Mango Fried Rice: Thumbs down. :( I was thinking it&#39;d be a typical brown soy-saucey fried rice with chicken &amp; mango. Nope. It&#39;s some sort of seasoned fried rice with chicken &amp; mango. The rice &amp; chicken are great, but the fresh ripe mango they use in it really has no place.
Veggie Lo Mein: Your standard lo mein. Their veggie lo mein has a LOT of mushrooms in it, not too much onions.
Crab rangoon: Wonderfully stuffed with the cream mixture and are delicious.

Delivery is also pretty quick. I order via Grubhub usually - always gets here in 20 mins flat. Maybe a full 30 minutes if I ordered during a peak time, like dinner or something."

Vegetable Chop Suey was also notable.

the reason for not giving them five stars is because of their prices. when compared to other chinese restaurants, the amount of the serving you get from here vs other places is typically the same, but china chefs prices are quite higher."

I had the Orange chicken and my husband had Mongolian Beef.  Both were very good.  We also had an order of egg rolls which were also quite good.  My daughter had a strawberry smoothie and loved it.  We&#39;ve had Chinese in the past which has been greasy and heavy and we&#39;ve questioned the ingredients.  Everything was fresh and tasty.   Can&#39;t wait to try something new next time!

The chicken was very fresh and lean. The egg rolls weren&#39;t the best. I would say they were more like a spring roll. The fried rice and bbq pork was decent as well. Well prolly order from here again. Delivery was quick and food was really hot on arrival.

We never tried from the former China Chef, but this one was hot, fresh, and delivered early! We will definitely order from them again!

The location is in Carol Stream, and we are in Glen Ellyn. This was absolutely no problem. They charged a minimal $2 fee, but it was well worth it!

My wife tried both Sesame and Orange chicken, and I tried Kung Pao chicken. Everything was great! The Orange chicken was probably my least favorite. We also had Chicken fried rice, which was cooked with fresh ingredients."

Only thing I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of was the sesame chicken, a bit sweet and the chicken was over cooked. The schezuan shrimp was so good and the veggies were definitely fresh and had a great crunch...yum! We will be regulars now and are officially ditching our old take out place!"

The egg rolls were just ok. Outside was nice and crunchy, not too greasy, but the flavor of the filling was not to our liking. The house fried rice was full of meat and good flavor, however the shrimp had a slightly off taste. The Szechuan chicken and Mongolian beef were both loaded with veggies, which I like but others may prefer more meat. The meat that was there however was tasty and tender. Both dishes though could have been more spicy, so we will probably ask for extra spice next time. They also came with a decent size side of white rice. The taro smoothie was excellent! Service was quick and efficient, food was ready in less than 15 mins. Prices were good and we ordered the small portions which were more than adequate. If you want leftovers though maybe get the large size. It was very easy to order online, so no mixup in translation. Overall happy to find a good place for takeout Chinese!"

The eggrolls are HORRIBLE! They are made with spring roll wrappers and had a distinct taste of curry in them! The beef fried rice tasted fishy at first and then I guess I got used to it because I tasted it less as I ate more, But I couldn&#39;t finish it. I miss the original owners and sadly will not be returning to this restaurant again! They didn&#39;t even have the crunchy chow mein noodles and their new slim menu has gotten rid of many options!

Will absolutely return and put this on my &#34;favorite places to eat in Chicago area&#34; list. Sesame chicken, homemade noodles, fried rice, and Mongolian beef were all phenomenal and felt clean. Not covered in too much sauce. 

Clean and exquisite atmosphere. The place was filled with Asian people (always a good sign). Server was quick, kind, funny, and helpful!

We went on a Saturday night with a group of 6.. we had a 7:15 reservation and got to sit around 7:30 not too bad considering they were very busy...
But they didn&#39;t have enough forks to give us so when dinner arrived we could not eat
When we sat they were also out of water glasses
Then it was no wonton noodles...
Thy seems out of many basic items...

Overall nice 

Best dish was the walnut shrimp
The beef broccoli tasted metallic 

Wonton soup very good

I&#39;d say go but know that due to crowd it&#39;s long wait times and thy may not have enough basic utensils to serve you properly"

Boy, were we disappointed.

We did a carry-out dinner order. 

Pretty standard order of egg rolls...lemon chicken and sweet and sour shrimp.

All of it was really bad.

I&#39;ll start with the egg rolls. The strangest egg rolls I&#39;ve ever had from a Chinese restaurant. They were filled with ingredients not normally found in your standard egg rolls. Long, thin, greasy and they just didn&#39;t taste quite right.

On to the lemon chicken....

The chicken inside the fried outer shell tasted like it had been left over from lunch...from the day before. It was really unappealing.

Speaking of unappealing. How &#39;bout that sweet and sour shrimp?

Unpleasant to look at and eat. Who leaves the tails on in sweet and sour shrimp? Chef Ping, that&#39;s who! Awful all around.

The rice wasn&#39;t good either (and yes, the rice carton has that &#34;bad breath&#34; smell...you know what I&#39;m talking about).

It was our first and last time with food from Chef Ping.

In a word, &#34;yuck&#34;!"

A lot of really authentic Chinese places tend to either have terrible customer service or somewhat decent customer service but a language barrier for some.  When I called here, you could hear all of the commotion in the background but the woman speaking to me was courteous and professional. She even repeated my order a couple of times back to me because it was a bit hard to hear with all of the noise.

I ordered my favorite dish: pork belly with preserved vegetables (comes with pancakes), ping&#39;s noodle platter, egg rolls, and the Fuchi faepian- a cold Sichuan dish that has marinated beef and tripe.  The cold dish was delicious and the flavor and spice was spot on!    The noodles had shrimp, scallop, pieces of squid and the container hardly closed.  Hell, even the egg rolls were perfectly fried.  Their egg rolls are what I would consider the smaller (smooth) egg rolls and not the fat ones that are dipped in egg yolk first.  I only mention this because I&#39;m a huge fan of the small ones and not so much of the large ones.  What was even more impressive was the portion and pricing for everything.  I feel like I&#39;ve been eating on the pork belly and the noodles for a week now and still have some leftover.

The only reason why this gets a four star besides a 5 is because the preserved vegetables (supposed to be like sour and salty) was really sugary.  I&#39;m thinking that whoever cooked it made the classic error of mixing up the salt and the sugar.  I didn&#39;t find out until I got home but it was obviously too sweet, which was a huge disappointment because I ended up throwing away everything in the dish other than the pork because it was SO sweet!  Such a shame!  With that being said, the pork was very tender and tasted wonderful on it&#39;s own or with the pancake.  Also, the rice also was mushy like someone added way too much water cooking it.  However, I didn&#39;t really care about the rice because I already had my noodle dish waiting for me.  

Takeaway: If you&#39;re a fan of cold Chinese apps, try the fu chi fae pian.  I know I will definitely be coming back to try more of their menu!"

I would prefer Chef Pings over Yu&#39;s Mandarin any day.  The only bad part is that there is usually a wait (30 mins to an hr?)  if you go without making a reservation.

Food
Noodles in Black Bean Sauce [in Korean it is called &#34;Jjajangmyun&#34;] - the portion is big and can be shared between 2 people or if you&#39;re extremely hungry, one person can finish the bowl and be full (to the point that you feel like you cannot breathe anymore.. sort of.. )

Sweet &amp; Sour Beef [in Korean it is called &#34;ttangsooyuk&#34;] - the option might not be in the menu because usually it is pork, but I prefer beef rather than pork.  The beef is battered &amp; fried perfectly then the sauce is poured over it.  Delicious and definitely a must try for all!! 

Atmosphere - great for groups/families, but expect to wait longer if you are in a group. [If you plan on going with a group of people, reservations are recommended]

Customer Service - ok, it really depends on who your waiter/waitress is...

I would recommend this Chinese restaurant [can&#39;t really find a restaurant like this one in the loop unfortunately :(].  The options here are pretty tasty &amp; portions are good for sharing!"

Seafood noodles still good but it was really noticeably different.

pretty good and the service is great. You can request to modify dishes like take out ham, or chicken, if you only want the fried rice to have shrimp. You can also request for Sriracha sauce. You&#39;ll need it if you like spicy because we requested everything spicy and it was not spicy at all. The Crab Rangoon is delicious!! 

I would suggest you buy dishes and share them because they are huge servings and can feed two people at least. For example, if you have three people, order two dishes and rice separately. Why separately? Because the rice that comes with your dish is a very small portion. 

Service is great here. They&#39;ll check up on you frequently and they&#39;ll pack up the food for you too if you have leftovers. It felt like we had a &#34;team&#34; of waiters."

I guess since I love so many dishes, I should have listed the ones that were not my faves: mango chicken and sesame chicken.

  We have ordered both the egg rolls and the crab rangoon from here. The egg rolls are delicious but small, when you see that they are $1.50 each.. you&#39;ll be amazed at how little band you get for your buck. The crab rangoon is the worst I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s more like a dessert than an appetizer.. They would be better without the nutmeg.

  The orange chicken is interesting, it&#39;s more like a BBQ style which was great until you look at the quality of the chicken inside.

It was dinner time, fairly packed. Even though it was a Friday night, the wait time was short (10 minutes or so), perhaps we were lucky. Plan accordingly if you&#39;re hungry and wish to avoid the crowd. The place is huge with two dining areas and a nice ambiance.

We ordered the Pong pong chicken, Sczechwan Eggplant and Gan Pong Diced chicken. They were all good. But I think every item that we ordered were breaded, deep fried and full of oil. That was my only qualm but otherwise it was good. 

Portions are huge and we probably ordered way too much. Next time gotta avoid going all wild and ordering so much.

The chefs keeping walking around occasionally to monitor stuff as well. Bring up any issues if you have to them. It&#39;s a nice way to personalize the experience and receive active feedback."

Ping&#39;s chicken wings is one of their specialty dishes that almost everyone gets. I totally agree with them as well.

I love chicken wings. While some say the PongPong have no meat and are just fried bones these are my go to asian flavor wings. Sweet with some spice and nice crispy bits. I don&#39;t get tired of eating these!!

Shrimp dumplings, another Chef Ping staple for me. Pieces of shrimp in a nicely steamed wrapper. 

Hunan beef &amp; chicken. I always order this, why, I don&#39;t know, the flavor is so good to me...

Pad Thai. This is one that went downhill. I love the noodle (Wide) which you don&#39;t see as much anymore, but the sauce on this dish is flavorless. Just look at the photos people post here. Barely any color and it tastes like it. To bad as I love Pad Thai."

Fast and respectful service, I think the waiter gave my whole party a choice of soup or salad to start off even though maybe it only came with a lunch special? 

Also, I was impressed by the amount of customers they had on a weekday.

We ordered sesame chicken, garlic chicken, pong pong chicken?, jampong and jajang. 

The sesame and garlic chicken came with rice an egg roll and a wonton crisp. They were perfectly prepared and not soggy at all!! I just didn&#39;t really like the garlic chicken - too strong, there&#39;s a weird after taste.. But that&#39;s my fault I guess. The sesame was amazing!

The pong pong chicken was supposed to be spicier than kanppungi which is the Korean spicy chicken wings.. But it was very mild. Haha maybe it&#39;s cause we&#39;re so used to Great Sea&#39;s spicy, sweet, big kanppungi that the pong pong was a little underwhelming. But by no means was it not enjoyable!

The jjajangmyun was thick and big portioned which is always good. You should ask for an extra bowl of sauce cause for the amount of noodles Chef Ping holds back that delicious black bean sauce.. it&#39;s so good why not have more to smother all over your face - I mean the noodles.. :)

Now the only let down today was the jampong. The broth was not spicy and refreshing like it should be, but more milky and mild? I think Chef Ping doesn&#39;t like to make things too spicy in order to cater to the non-Asian customers, which they have many! But again, great big portion :)

Overall, I would definitely come again, but just skip the jampong."

I know, I know, there is MSG in like, everything. But once it hits a certain threshold in my system, I get this crazy, major, crawl into bed and hope to die migraine. The one time I ate at Chef Ping, I asked them specifically not to use MSG. They said &#34;Oh we don&#39;t use MSG.&#34; I said YAY! And then that night I felt like someone put my brain in a blender.

I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve changed their ways since then, but I&#39;m just not willing to take a chance."

Couple times we walked away choosing not to wait possibly a long time.

This is a popular place for sure!
They won&#39;t seat you unless all the people are present.
Food was good, service was kind of slow due to the kitchen being very busy. 
This is definitely one of the better choice for Chinese cuisine."

Being asian, I&#39;ve gone to plenty of Chinese food Restaurants. But this place tops the cake for having the worst service I have ever experienced.

PROS:
-Restaurant is decently clean.
-Food tastes Ok.

CONS:
-Service is terrible! And when I say terrible, I mean it. The Chinese lady who slightly served our table (Her name is Hong) demanded a higher tip on my $75 bill. Stating that 3 dollars wasn&#39;t enough. However a tip is given for a job well done. She did nothing of the sort. She ignored us, food was served by a 6 different staff. She gave awesome service to the american families around us, but completely treated us like garbage. As we were walking out of the restaurant, she hails us down, demanding we give her more. My father-in-law doesn&#39;t speak much english, so she hounded him for more money.
-Earlier I said restaurant is clean, and it is for the most part. Seats are well taken care of, and most of the restaurant from what I can see. However, I had to fight my food with at least 5 Flies. Talk about gross.

Honestly, I would rather go to Panda Express than this joke of a restaurant. This is one of the worst Chinese Restaurants I have ever gone to, period."

I have never actually eaten in the restaurant, but I&#39;ve waited for take out there and it looks like a nice place. The take out service is convenient as they have a separate place at the bar for it, so you don&#39;t have to wait or ask the hostess where to go. 

My favorite dishes are their mu shu pork and kung pao chicken. The mu shu pork is served in one container, with plum sauce and pancakes on the side so nothing gets messy when you do take out. The kung pao chicken is really well done, just make sure you don&#39;t eat any of the peppers in it because they are hot!!"

I have had my rehearsal dinner here, my brother had his as well. We have most family events here because they are accommodating and work with us to create a great menu. 

We always get the mapo tofu, the pong pong chicken wings, sweet and sour pork, black bean noodles, and seafood noodle soup. All of these are our go tos and for good reason - they&#39;re all delicious. 

Their walnut shrimp, szechuan shrimp, 12 ingredient tofu in a pot, hot pepper beef, and summer salad are also great too. 

I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a higher end Chinese sit down restaurant. They do get busy so reserve your spot if you have a party of 6 or more.

The Mongolian beef which was my second dish was so greasy it truly wasn&#39;t edible. We each order two dishes and passed them around nothing really screamed you have to come back here.

Hope this sends a notice to ownership of  Chef Ping.   Based on my 9/4 &amp;  9/24/2016 visits,  owner must drastically improve the time the food is ordered and delivered to the customer&#39;s table. 

9/4 visit,  one of the simple dishes we ordered (Orange Beef) never arrived after 
ONE HOUR from order.  After 30 min, our waitress kept telling us she was checking, but there&#39;s was a wait.  After ONE HOUR when our other food was eaten, but cancelled the order.

9/25 visit,    we ordered a vegetable dish,  orange beef (again),  sizzling beef dish, and fried fish.  From the time we ordered,  It took about 20 minutes for our vegetable dish to arrive.   After that,  it took another 30 minutes for our orange beef &amp; fish dishes to arrive.    Then,  another 15 minute for our final dish the Sizzling Beef platter to arrive.  Unfortunately,  the sizzling beef, NEVER came out on a sizzling platter.

When I complained to our waitress on 9/25 she was very apologetic,  and did acknowledge the kitchen was busy/backed up.  While I was doing this, the family next to us had the same issue. 

If the kitchen is understaffed,  owners better get more help,  plain and simple."

Hands down, in the general Chicago area, this is the best place to stop by for these two items. The noodles aren&#39;t too chewy, the black bean sauce isn&#39;t too salty and has a nice balance of sweetness, and the meat is crispy even after sitting in the sauce for a little bit. If you haven&#39;t tried these two items, I&#39;d highly recommend it. I mean, who would try &#34;Noodles in Black Bean Sauce&#34; if you didn&#39;t actually know what it was?

There&#39;s often a wait to get into the restaurant. On a Saturday evening, my girlfriend and I had to wait around 45 minutes to get in without a reservation. (We made the decision to come here spontaneously.) It&#39;s definitely worth the wait. The food here is a lot less greasier than I Chinese food I&#39;ve tried at other restaurants around here, and the interior is spacious and pleasant to be in.

Food: The food is different every time I&#39;ve gone there. I ordered the Sweet &amp; Sour chicken one time and received extremely tasty and delectable food.

Definitely one of my favorite if not favorite Chinese restaurants in the Chicagoland area. I say Chinese but you do see quite a bit of Korean influence in  some of the dishes. It is a subtle but great fusion.

If you come here for dinner it will be extremely packed/busy. You have been warned. If you haven&#39;t been here before I would say it is worth the wait. If you have ever been and loved the old Yu&#39;s Mandarin, this is the place for you. Rumor has it that the original owner&#39;s children decided to open their own restaurant and hired some of the same staff. The menu and flavor are pretty much the same as I remember. Over the years Chef Ping&#39;s has raised the prices of some of their dishes. Unfortunately one of them used to be my favorite. The beef tendon and sea cucumber is absolutely delicious. It used to be a steal but with the price changes it is now overpriced. Still tastes great but is no long my go to dish. The yellow chives with pork is great with rice. Kid&#39;s will love the pongpong chicken. It is like the korean sweet and spicy chicken drumsticks/wings.

Go try it out you&#39;ll love it."

Their Mongolian beef is probably one of the best I have ever had, it literally melts in your mouth. I also really like their combination fried rice, as well as their wings.

This is a casual place and they accommodate large parties.

Utter &#34;Chef Ping&#34; amongst the Chinese or Korean that live in the burbs and chances are that they go here for their family style Chinese/Korean meals.  

They do try to stress the quality of service here especially for the larger tables in the back with plate swapping near the middle of your menu. 

Some items that we usually have for family meals included the honey walnut shrimp.  JaJa mein (though its never a favorite of mine).  Salt and Pepper tofu (must get), The pong pong chicken (make sure to get extra rice for all the sauce haha!). Schezwan green beans are delicious.  But garlic stir fried pea shoots for $16?!   come on now...8 treasure rice for dessert is a different kind of dessert (not overly sweet)  which Ping does fairly well.  

Chef Ping is a bit pricier and portions a bit smaller than the restaurants in Chinatown for family style meals, but still better than the alternative of driving from the burbs thru the traffic nightmare of the loop.

In fact, the food is among the worst I have had in the greater Chicago area. The Sesame Chicken was so over-cooked it was powder dry in the middle - it also had way too much batter and way too little sauce. How can they blow a basic dish like Sesame Chicken? We had the Sweet Sour Fish and the fish was tasteless and the sauce was just plain weird.  The portions in general are quite small also, and all the dishes were quite greasy (too much oil). We also had the signature crab dish with salted egg (&#34;Gold Dust&#34;) coating. Wow, the crab was over-cooked and the meat was completed dry inside the shells. To add insult to injury, the crab shells were not pre-cracked and they did not provide any cracker tool or special fork. We asked several times for a crab cracker tool and waited 10 minutes before one arrived. The crab was all cold by then. POOR SERVICE.

Talking about poor service... we ordered 8 dishes. The last two dishes were still 80% full and they came and gave us the check and asked us if we needed anything else. I was literally still picking food from the dish when the waiter came and took them away for boxing. Given someone at our table give the waiter permission to do so, but he only did it because he felt pressured. It was 6:30 and they were people waiting for tables. So, I understand they want to turn over the tables quickly. But come on, at least let people finish their food in peace. BAD FOOD &amp; BAD SERVICE. I don&#39;t know how this place got a 4 star rating. 

Also, in terms of dining ambience, because the place is so crowded, they pack the tables close together. So the place feel very stuffy, you feel cramped and it so noisy it&#39;s hard to hear your dinning companions.

Service thou,sometimes not the greatest.
When I go out I do it for he whole experience. Service and food.otherwise I can stay home and cook as good as any!
I agree that is very busy at times,however when you wait 45 minutes or so to be seated,than another 5-10 to even be aknolaged,it&#39;s bad.(you can&#39;t make reservations unless are 6 or more people)
Here you are, very hungry and frustrated. and you don&#39;t want to order the same Mongolian beef,you ask the server to help you figure out what&#39;s what. you stare at the menu than at the server and again at menu. You have to decide alone !!!!! No help!
I have a suggestion: pictures accompanied by short list of ingredients.
One time, me and my husband ordered appetizers, soup and a main dish.
We got all the food at once but the soup was forgotten. When half an hour into our dinner I asked about the soup,the server mumbled something and ran into the kitchen. He came back telling us &#34;coming,coming now. We canceled the order,it was to late.I expected an apologie but I got a pair of eyes pinning me in my chair.
Again, the food is fresh, well cooked and elevated as far as Chinese food goes. 
Maybe the owners should invest equal effort in finding servers that play the part of a Chinese restaurant in America .
Language and understanding it is important, specially if you live and work here.
Lack of intelligent communication,even if is only for  food and entertainment, can tarnish any potentially great experience.
It&#39;s good to go dinning here when is less busy so you feel like a patron of the restaurant and not next in line at any fast food store.
Even Wendy&#39;s gives you more respect!
Sorry dear owners for the less than perfect review, but I hope you want to grow and stay in business for long time!

Typically, they go to China Town for good Chinese food.  They said that this was the best place close by that was almost equivalent to China Town status Chinese food.  But, at least it is closer than going to China Town, so I will be coming here more often now that I have been introduced to Chef Ping.

Unfortunately, I cannot recall all the food we ordered as they were the ones who ordered for us, in Chinese.  I will do my utmost best to recall what it was we ordered.  I remember eating Salt and Pepper Squid, Walnut Shrimp, Szechwan Fish Fillet, Mongolian Beef, Sauteed Peapod Tips, Mandarin Bean Curd, and I&#39;m sure there are others we ordered but can&#39;t remember.  

Salt and Pepper Squid was just to die for.  If this is all we ate, I could eat this with rice and be happy.  As for the Walnut Shrimp, this was also very addicting.  The combination of the sweet sauce with the honey walnut and saltiness of the shrimp was perfect.  Szechwan Fish Fillet was was another unforgettable dish we had.  This is great by itself or even with rice.  Just keep guzzling the green tea after each dish and your taste buds resets so that you can get the real flavor of the other dish you eat.  The Mongolian Beef was also perfect with the rich flavors combined with the vegetables and beef.  The beef was moist and not tough, just how we like it.  Second to last is the Peapod Tips, this is a great dish to have for a vegetable dish.  I believe hardly any Chinse restaurants serve this unless you&#39;re in China Town.  I am in love with this dish.  Lastly, the Mandarin Bean Curd is something everyone should order as an appetizer.  It&#39;s a great dish to start the entire meal.  

I found my go to Chinese Restaurant."

Was not impressed by the Ping&#39;s Noodle platter as the dish was not very spicy, nor flavorful. It also seemed like there wasn&#39;t enough sauce for all the noodles. Service was very quick; food came out fast, servers were constantly filling cups and checking to make sure all orders were on their way. One disappointment was that the hostess skipped us and seated another party before us when we were there first. Would definitely return to try more items on the menu!"

The other reviews are right, wait times can be excessive. However, you will understand why once you enjoy the food! 

We came in on a busy Tuesday night. It was a ten-minute wait for a table, so we decided to eat at the bar area. No regrets, we actually found it quieter and easier to have a conversation. 
Service here is always top-notch. Regardless of the crowds. 

We always start our meal here with a fresh bowl of soup. 
The wonton soup is excellent and is served piping hot! 
My father usually orders the Hot n&#39; Sour Soup and raves about it. 

The menu here has some &#34;americanized&#34; selections, however they do offer favorites for those craving a taste from back home. You know it is good when you see a ton of oriental people packing the restaurant! (I say this with the utmost respect!) 

Next, we ordered the Mandarin Soy Duck! It was hands-down the best duck we&#39;ve ever had. It is served at room-temp and is utterly amazing. The duck is so tender and the mandarin soy marinade just made it melt in your mouth! If you are a duck person, you must give it a try. 

The hot dishes as I mentioned before, are mostly americanized. However, do not let this shy you away. Chef Ping is NOT your typical &#34;americanized&#34; chinese joint. 

My favorite dish here is the Kung Pao Beef, when it comes to &#34;americanized&#34; dishes. 
The beef is so tender you barely have to chew. It is incredible. 
Plus, if you love it spicy like I do, just ask them to make it extra spicy. 
Chef Ping uses incredible seasonings and technique to raise the bar on Chinese Cuisine. 

Another favorite is the Salt n Pepper Smelt or Ping&#39;s Noodle Soup. 
The noodles are homemade and served in an amazing (spicy) broth abundant with veggies, squid, and shrimp! The Noodle soup is enough for 2 (maybe 3) people! 

As with all portions at Chef Ping, you can feed 2-3 people from any entree. 

Simply put, Chef Ping is the undisputed best in Chicago and in my opinion, the whole state!
Give it a try, you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Everything was hot and fresh, and their crab rangoon are to die for. Normally I&#39;m not a fan of Mongolian beef because I find it to be tough, but it was tender and had amazing flavor here. 
The staff is outstanding, our empty dishes barely touched the table before being whisked away. Everyone was incredibly friendly, and who I can only assume was the owner stopped and chatted with us. We will definitely be back!"

Around 11:20 is a good time to arrive to be sure you don&#39;t have to wait for a table. My favorite meals are the hot noodle platter and  kung pao shrimp, and we love the fried pot stickers. Highly recommended; there is a reason this place is so often packed."

We showed up at 6:30pm on a Friday and were told it was a 45 minute wait for us 4. It ended up being about 25-30 minutes, which was a nice surprise.

The service is really friendly, prompt, and the food comes out quickly. Our server made good recommendations when we were trying to figure out what to get from one part of the menu, say, the beef section. When we got all our dishes, we realized that three of them are kind of large combo platters (the Summer Salad, Noodle Platter, &amp; Seafood Combo) and fairly similar. I wish our server could&#39;ve noticed this and mentioned something about it.

SALT &amp; PEPPER FAMILY: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chef-ping-rolling-meadows?select=ULSFZadx5zo3yKfUuwj4Mw#ULSFZadx5zo3yKfUuwj4Mw
* Salt &amp; Pepper Tofu ($7.95) - 3.5 stars
pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chef-ping-rolling-meadows?select=ULSFZadx5zo3yKfUuwj4Mw#5a9mYshEUNTOLSapo54Fuw
Smaller than I&#39;d expected; the tofu had a nice &amp; thin breading to it, but with such thick pieces, even though they&#39;re flavored on the outside, most of each piece doesn&#39;t have much flavor on the inside. 

BEEF: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chef-ping-rolling-meadows?select=ULSFZadx5zo3yKfUuwj4Mw#mk328sO7r4tZF_cIGdAX0g
* Mushroom Beef (beef w/ big sliced king mushroom in a delicate sauce. $13.95) - 4.5 stars
pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chef-ping-rolling-meadows?select=ULSFZadx5zo3yKfUuwj4Mw#lCNK7oQDdF5xlwlSq5g00g
The beef comes in huge slices and is incredibly satisfying to chew through, the meat is so good! The large mushroom slices are great too; they&#39;re not too overpowering as I often find with everyday Chinese dishes with mushroom.

OLD TIME FAVORITE FROM HOME: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chef-ping-rolling-meadows?select=ULSFZadx5zo3yKfUuwj4Mw#PB25xiohZjZTaz2ONVpztw
1. Summer Salad (cold, hot &amp; mustard salad on bean noodle. $16.95) - 3 stars
pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chef-ping-rolling-meadows?select=ULSFZadx5zo3yKfUuwj4Mw#dr0-dftz-Hf6cWnR_R1mLQ
I didn&#39;t love the flavors in this - I could definitely taste the mustard/horseradish throughout, which was an odd pairing for me, and having a cold dish in November in the Midwest just isn&#39;t as comforting as the hot dishes.

NOODLES &amp; RICE: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chef-ping-rolling-meadows?select=ULSFZadx5zo3yKfUuwj4Mw#NfNpQq_4U8lOkpO1D7ABhQ
* Ping&#39;s Noodle Platter (seafood, pork, vegetables over noodles. $9.50) - 4 stars
pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chef-ping-rolling-meadows?select=ULSFZadx5zo3yKfUuwj4Mw#zMfBaiJEnMO00ePQifpRDg
This was great - the noodles are pretty thick and soft, and there is just a ton of delicious stuff in the dish. 

SEAFOOD
* Chef Ping&#39;s Seafood Combo ($14.95) - 4 stars
pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chef-ping-rolling-meadows?select=ULSFZadx5zo3yKfUuwj4Mw#iuwwxE9MG_dCOmvrYrMqbg
Another good all-round dish, with lots of good seafood.

We just ordered a variety of shushes and did family style: take some, pass it down! Each dish was delicious, I would do this the same again. 

I recommend the salt and pepper squid, mapo tofu (on the menu I think it&#39;s called Lady Mao bean curd) and Chinese broccoli."

Food is fine and service is fine. Nothing really outstanding. The recent visit was horrible!!! We went there on a Wed for lunch and got a tiny table along the walk way. This place has too many tables in there.  what really bothers me is that the waitress for other tables walk back and forth by our table every time she wanted to go to other tables. Her clothes almost touched our food every time!!!! I lost my appetite... and I asked her if she can use the walk way along the tables that were empty. She got so mad said we need to understand her work! Huh???!!!

The chicken in my friend&#39;s sweet and sour chicken dinner was bountiful. The restaurant has lots of seating and a nice cocktail menu--I enjoyed the mai tai.

Food quality is consistently good. They do tend to get busy, but that&#39;s because of how good it is.  They do a robust to-go business as well, mainly for that reason. 

On weekends, prepare for a wait, but during the week you shouldn&#39;t have any trouble. 

My favorites include Mongolian Beef, General Tso&#39;s Chicken, and Peking Duck - all are prepared in a way that&#39;s consistent with the superior options in Chinatown, or on the West coast.  When you see significant numbers of Chinese people eating at a Chinese restaurant, it says something. 

Worth the wait. Enjoy."

Been coming here for years. The food and service have always been good. Recently I came and ordered the same thing I always get. What the server brought was not at all what I was expecting. The dish was different, in both taste and form. When I called the server over to ask if they had switched recipes she insisted that what she brought was indeed correct. She insisted I asked for the wrong thing. Instead of trying to make things right she just took the dish away and didn&#39;t offer an alternative. So while the rest of my party ate their dishes I got to sit and watch them. It wasn&#39;t until later that the server got the idea to see if I&#39;d like something else. Sorry, but too late, the damage had been done.

It&#39;s unfortunate that this happened because I&#39;ve been coming here for a number of years. I think this place has become too popular for its own good. I feel that they no longer care about it&#39;s customers which is why I no longer care to spend my money here.

The silver lining is that at least there&#39;s other chinese restaurants in the area that are just as tasty..."

This last time was last month while we were in town for the wedding. They had the rehearsal dinner here on a Friday night.

Summer salad: Cold, hot and mustard salad on bean noodle, big serving. I&#39;d never had this dish before. It was cold and refreshing, but had a really nice kick from the hot mustard.

Pong pong chicken: Hot &amp; tangy sauce on a chicken lollipop. Yum! Sticky, garlicky, sweet, savory. Rivals my favorite wings in SF.

Lady mao&#39;s bean curd: Well known folk dish, tofu with minced pork. Great with some rice!

Gan pong shrimp: Original recipe dated back to the old san tung province, burned hot pepper with chopped garlic glaze. A shrimp version of the chicken wings I love?! Yes please! First time having this dish and I loved it!

Combination fried rice: Shrimp, chicken, ham with a touch of soy sauce. Nicely fried and full of flavor! The kids loved this!

Beef with peppers, onions and carrots: I don&#39;t remember this dish too well, but I do remember the beef and veggies were stir fried well.

Asian style sweet and sour beef: I don&#39;t really like sweet and sour dishes but the roommate&#39;s brother loves it!

Walnut shrimp: Jumbo shrimp in rich creamy sauce with honey coated walnuts and steamed broccoli. Yum! The shrimp were big and juicy!

Sea cucumber and scallops with mushrooms, cauliflower and peas: I loved the scallops and veggies in this dish!

Sauteed baby bok choy: Bok choy was cooked well and flavor was nice and garlicky.

Noodles in black bean sauce: Pork, baby shrimp, onion &amp; zucchini slow cooked in black bean sauce served over homemade noodles. The roommate loves this dish. And the kids were enjoying it as well.

Ping&#39;s noodle soup: Noodle in spicy broth cooked with fine shredded pork, seafood and vegetables. One of my favorite dishes! The soup was spicy and savory and dish was full of seafood and veggies!

Service was good, but it took some time for the last two dishes to come out. I understood since everything was pre ordered except those two. And every table was adding several orders of the last two dishes.

I&#39;m glad I was introduced to this place since I would definitely go back. I don&#39;t even need a rehearsal dinner as an excuse!"

I sadly came here several times and tried about 4 items. They were all bland and sad. During lunch time usually the places around my work are all packed. This place is always empty save for a few lost souls... makes you wonder..

Service is quick though and I like that they bring it to you. Go to a cheap take out place, I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll taste better for a lot less (though they&#39;re all unhealthy food)"

No one is educated on the importance of preparing a special order item to avoid an allergen. 

Told staff I needed to avoid dairy. Asked of the spaghetti and meatballs were dairyfree. They said they weren&#39;t, I asked if it was just the meatballs that contained dairy or if the sauce did as well. They said they both did (however, online shows the marinara is, so not sure who to believe). I ordered noodles with NO butter, plain. Food came out, noodles looked shiny, asked if there was butter... staff was pissy saying NO and brushed me off... I look at my sons face grinning cause he LOVED the &#34;dairy free butter&#34; they used. Ummmm, NOT ok. I wiped the bottom of his bowl with a napkin and showed the staff all the butter on his plate. They said.. &#34;Oh the cook mist have made it wrong..&#34; Really?.. thank god it wasn&#39;t an anaphylactic type of reaction, but what if it were?! 

Please.. educate your staff and chef about the importance of, not only preparing food as it is ordered, but about food allergies. I do enjoy your food but no longer feel as though I can bring my whole family to your establishment and eat safely.

First time I was here, I tried the lunch size portion. I liked my entree so much that I went for the full size dish next time. I tend to be a creature of habit when I find something I like. The Indonesian Peanut Sauté with chicken has captured my taste buds each time I&#39;ve been there. It&#39;s made with rice noodles, spicy peanut sauce, broccoli, carrots, cabbage, sprouts, cilantro, crushed peanuts and lime. Had a nice kick to it, but not too overwhelming.

I showed up one time when they were busy filling a large order and waited maybe a minute or two at the front counter. The lady who took my order apologized that I had to wait so long and said there would be no charge for my drink. Wow, I didn&#39;t expect that but appreciated the gesture. I ordered a cookie too, since I didn&#39;t pay for my drink.

I used to work near this location and can&#39;t recall having very many issues at all, but today was very disappointing for me. 
Firstly, I hardly consider 230pm on a Weekday much of a prime rush time. I was one of two customers ordering and there were only one or two other people in the restaurant who weren&#39;t even necessarily eating but conducting business. 
The young man behind the register was very short with me as though he had better things to do with his time. Being a healthy water as well as gluten sensitive, I ordered my usual with the gluten free pasta alternative. Now I don&#39;t know if it varies from store to store on protocol, but I was charged $2 extra for gluten free. The past 2 times id ordered tubs from other locations, zero upcharge. And if a thing, I&#39;d read online from another reviewer that it was $1 upcharge. Not to nickle and dime, but at least a little consistency would be nice. On top of that, when I got home, my med salad was missing feta, thus simply becoming.. Some lettuce, very little cucumber - onion - and tomato, and less olives than I have fingers on one hand. 
Needless to say, disappointing. For something I had been feeling like having if for awhile not having it meet previously set standards. I write this review because I sincerely hope service here improves. I didn&#39;t call the store or rush back because I&#39;m already exhausted from my day and frankly do not care to come across as one of those individuals who are ultimately seeking free crap, I just want what I paid for the way it&#39;s always been served up. Besides, they can handle a direct complaint by throwing free crap at you, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily solve the service issue that might be more noticed based on noticeable free speech such as this.  Better luck to me next time, or at a different location I suppose?"

The service was very welcoming.  I was waiting for a friend near the front but staff wanted to know if I needed help with the menu but also offered a drink that could be charged after I ordered.

I like how all the ingredients are listed under each item.  They have good variety with sizes and combinations so you can get a small bowl with a protein plus a soup or a salad.  Now they also have sandwiches that you can add a soup or salad.  Plus, it&#39;s organized by cuisine.  The portions are decent value.

The sauce tasted homemade and they gave you a lot on the noodles(which i like so the noodles dont all stick together) They also put 5 meatballs on the speghetti that are pretty good in size(about golf ball size) the meat had a good seasoned tasted, which is always nice to get a flavor and not just meat!!!

That&#39;s what I used to think before I picked up a certificate for a &#34;tasting tour&#34; that was bundled with passes to the Illinois Railway Museum at a silent auction this past spring. Well, the IRM was a bust, but at least dinner was great.

We did not have the typical experience here, as instead of ordering at the counter, we had an employee bring us out a variety of dishes, two at a time, for us to sample. Over the course of an hour or so we had probably 5 or 6 different dishes, all of which were amazing (even our daughter&#39;s buttered noodles were amazing). Our server was great too. Even though there was a mix up in the communication and he wasn&#39;t expecting us, he didn&#39;t miss a beat and made sure we were well taken care of, even throughout the 3 or 4 rushes they had while we were there.

It was definitely spicy, as the description says, but spicy the way pepperoni is. Kind of like I was eating a pizza in pasta form.

Even after mixing everything together, it was still tasteless.  But it gets better.  After digging into my bowl of blandness, my pad thai contained several elbow macaroni pasta shells!

I have a friend who used to live in St. Charles and I passed this place a number of times on the way to her house.  I&#39;m a big fan of brew pub-type places such as this, so being in North Aurora earlier in the day, this place crossed my mind as we wanted to try some place &#34;new&#34;.

I was delighted to learn that beer flights were on special on Saturday... $8 for 4 decent size glasses, you really get your moneys worth with this deal!  They have lots of beer on tap as well to try for their flights.

It wasn&#39;t crowded at all, but the service was good, we got our food and drinks in a reasonable amount of time.  We got the buffalo chicken dip for an appetizer...we probably should have stuck with appetizers and beer, but we got meals too.  My sister got the tuna melt, she said it was way too salty, I got the chicken pesto panini...I sensed a bit too much salt as well, but it&#39;s not like my meal was ruined because of it.  There is an additional up charge for sweet potato fries, but we got those too, they were pretty good!
As others mentioned, yes... a bit over priced.  I paid $32 for a beer flight, 1/2 appetizer and a chicken pesto panini.  I also don&#39;t live in the area, so I&#39;m not entirely sure I&#39;d be back here any time soon."

The place would be a decent spot to watch sports, lots of tvs easily viewable. Also, 2 projections for large events.  Many of the seats were ripping, but nothing that would make it too trashy.

Unfortunately, the establishment immediately started letting me down. There was no hostess to seat me, so I took a seat in the bar area where I was totally ignored for about 10 minutes. The restaurant was busy and there was a Hawks game on so there was a lot of drinking going on, but it was also during a snowstorm so only about half the place was full. 

Finally, the frat boy bartender (Dude! Man! Bro!) came over to me and told me he&#39;d be taking care of me. 

I ordered an iced tea and asked about the specials. He rattled off something about $1 burgers and went to get my drink. Now according to both the website and sign outside, the fried pickles are supposed to be free on Mondays. He didn&#39;t mention that, but I ordered them anyway, along with the Pork &amp; Cheese burger, which was supposed to be crispy pork belly and fried provolone atop a burger.  It sounded good. 

Much too much time passed until Dude returned and told me my food would be up soon. I think the problem was he was trying to make all the drinks for the whole place and didn&#39;t have time to sling my food. Whatevs. He should have asked one of the myriad lingering waiters who we&#39;re hovering around the bar (and even laying on it at one point) to cover his table. 

That was the last I saw of Bro until the end of my meal. My burger was brought out by a manager looking fellow in a sports jacket. He had no knowledge of the pickles but said he&#39;d bring them out. That turned into him placing a quickie order for them since DudeManBro totally forgot. 

He also forgot to check on me and ask how everything was, and also refill my drink til I was almost ready to leave. 

The food was pretty nasty. The pretzel bun was refrigerator cold. The burger, a premade patty thing was cooked rare, which is how I like it, but I was never asked how well done I wanted it and I know most places are required to do medium unless specially ordered. The bun was sitting in a pool of juice and grease. I was pretty grossed out. The crispy pork belly was more like over cooked pulled pork and the cheese was totally flavorless. I couldn&#39;t finish it. 

The pickles finally came out, also delivered by manager guy, and they were tough and bitter. I think the coating was burnt, but I couldn&#39;t tell. The Bloody Mary ketchup did nothing to enhance them. 

Overall, the menu is very interesting but the execution is just bad. And the service is beyond bad. I would never come back here and encourage you to do the same."

First warning, 6pm, Sunday, and there are 5 cars in the lot.  6 with ours.  I even mentioned this to the Wife.  It did fill up with a few more people after we came, but...

Second warning, this used to be an old Bennigans a few years back.  The inside looks like they hadn&#39;t updated it since Bennigan&#39;s moved out, other than the bar area.  This isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, but Bennigan&#39;s was a volume place, and a lot of people coming/going wears seats, tables, floors, etc down.  It showed.

Food was ok.  I&#39;m a simple person, and like simple food.  Just a burger please.  No crap or contamination (I.E. veggies), on top of it.  Burger came out on a smaller pretzel bun, and the patty looked like a McD&#39;s 1/4 patty that they just took out of the box in the freezer and threw on the grille.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but nothing I&#39;d rave abour either.  Got the waffle fries, which were good.  I used the leftover cheese from our Pretzel appetizer (which was good), with the fries.  I LOVE cheese fries...  My Wife had some tacos, about the only thing she said was that 2 of the 3 filled her up.  So nothing special here.

Our server Barb was really nice, but she did take some time getting us our check.  She did say that part of the order for the people that came in and were seated next to us, was wrong, so she was back handling that for awhile.  No biggie.  But it&#39;s no after 7, and we have two children  who have the patience of a gnat.  So meltdown time was quickly coming.

Overall, not bad, but right now, unless things change (based on all the other reviews I am reading), not a place we&#39;re going to rush back to.  They did have a nice bar, and it looked to be a larger selection of beers.  Not being a beer afficianado (other than the basic Miller staples I can get at the grocery store), I couldn&#39;t tell the quality of the selections.

I visited again this past weekend and I&#39;m happy to report changes in the quality of the food seem to have taken place. 

We started with a couple of Bloody Mary&#39;s. They were $4 and the first one was served with a couple green olives, carrot stick, pickle slice, celery stick and cube of cheese. The drinks were zesty and flavorful.

Also to start, we ordered the homemade potato chips with white truffle oil and french onion dip. The french onion dip was the best I ever had. We asked the waiter, who was quite knowledgeable and friendly, what was in it. He told us it was homemade mixture of sour cream and cream cheese peppered with sauteed onions. As delicious as it sounds. 

We ordered the Kentucky Ale Beer Bourbon Ale, which is on tap. Each time my beer came to me in a snifter with a beautiful head. I could tell the glasses were clean because a foamy trail was left behind on the inside of my glass. If you like bourbon and you enjoy beer, then this is the beer for you. Seriously, the best beer I ever had. Careful though, it has a high alcohol content! 

For my entree, I ordered the Mac &amp; Cheese with pork belly and the cheese sauce in the Mac &amp; Cheese was definitely homemade and tasty. It was served with a belt of well-seasoned pork belly. I ate the whole thing!

One of my dinner companions just ordered Teriyaki chicken wings and he said that they were tasty and meaty, while other dinner mate consumed with gusto a hamburger with a fried egg, bacon and cheese. 

We even ordered dessert: New York cheese cake and creme brulee. Both decent enough. 

Service was fast and friendly and our waiter was knowledgeable about the ingredients. It sounds like Spotted Fox has paid attention to some of the negative reviews they&#39;ve heard and I feel like they deserve another visit. They&#39;re definitely back on my radar. Keep up the good work!"

The BBQ sauce was thin and it didn&#39;t even taste much like BBQ. The sauce was bright red, and I never would have guessed that it was a southwest sauce. 

I ordered the smokehouse sandwich with pulled prok, bacon, white cheddar, pickles, and fried shallots. It was a pretty good sandwich, the pork was very tender. I liked the sweet potato fries as they were cut really thick.

Also, I give them props for having a foosball table. The service was very friendly. They even gave me a sample of their down &#39;n out wing sauce when I just expressed my curiosity about it. I didn&#39;t even ask for the sample. I would return for a drink, but I can&#39;t see this place ever becoming a lunch or dinner destination for me."

At least my husband won&#39;t, not even to use up the remaining $60+ on our gift card. 

This restaurant seems like one that would be seen on Gordon Ramsey&#39;s Kitchen Nightmares. The food is not interesting and carelessly prepared. During our time there I got the sense that the owner was skimping on quality in order to save money. 

I ordered sliders for my 1 &amp; 3 year old boys to share and was very disappointed--they got 3 small pretzel buns, each with 1/4 of a hamburger patty on them. Seriously--the cut a regular sized hamburger into quarters and used them for sliders! The burger was clearly a frozen party that they&#39;d bought and then cooked on the grill. I&#39;m sorry, but it was a cheap and tacky excuse for sliders. It cost $10 and I feel like I could have prepared the same quality dish at home for far less. I&#39;d ordered the appetizer for my boys to share, expecting 3 small but meaty burgers. I was very annoyed.

I ordered myself the southwest salad which came in a fried tortilla bowl. The tortilla bowl was very greasy so I didn&#39;t eat much of it. And the salad had a bunch of hot peppers in it, which was NOT indicated on the menu. I can&#39;t handle much spice so I barely ate half of the salad. I wouldn&#39;t have ordered it had I known it would have been so spicy.

My husband ordered himself a burger and, again, it was clearly a frozen party that they&#39;d bought and then cooked. He was not impressed. 

One more note: the wood veneer on the edge of our table was peeling off and missing in spots. It felt shady and, again, cheap. 

A minor revamp in decor and a higher quality menu--both in ingredients and preparation--would make this a much better place to eat."

My opp to try the Spotted Fox came today when the misses bought a Groupon offering $30 for $15.  

Beer menu - Respectable.  They have 30 rotating drafts and 20 bottled beers to select from.  The bottled selection is average with some highlights, the draft selection has some rarer choices and a decent range.  I tried the Vander Mill Totally Roasted Cider.  Goes down like an odd concoction of cider beer and wine, but has a nice finish.

Food - Had the Cali Panini which was tasty.  They offer sweet potato fries which always makes me happy, and theirs are delicious.  

Service - Quick and friendly.  Our waiter was well versed with both menu&#39;s and carried a good conversation about beer choices in-house and around town.  He also gave us the lowdown on their daily specials, which includes some bargain buys every night of the week.   

Ambiance - I liked their setup.  They have a full bar with an extension area of generous seating and a separate dining section, which is only separated by a half wall.  This makes the whole restaurant visible no matter where you sit.  I like the open air feeling. They have a multitude of tv&#39;s with sports if you&#39;re looking to catch a game.  

The only downsides: food prices are a tad high in my opp, and the craft beer menu could be more diverse &amp; larger.  Fix those things and I think you create more repeat customers."

We went back last week because we had a coupon and thought maybe the first time was just first week jitters and it had improved but not so much. The server seemed inexperienced at best. My son wanted the pretzel appetizer which was basically a pretzel hot dog bun unsliced. For her dinner my daughter ordered the mac and cheese. The description sounded very well put together but the cheese in the adult pork belly mac and cheese was the same neon orange sauce they give you with the pretzel appetizer as dip. All of our food was equally as underwhelming as was the service. We won&#39;t be giving it a third time. The only reason it got 2 stars was the treatment from the hostess stand in seating and the staff who was in charge of walking around keeping the table clear of finished dishes and such. It had potential. Adequate number of tvs for great sports watching and environment but the food is terrible.

I imagine it would work for people staying in hotels or at Pheasant Run. But honestly, there&#39;s not much here to recommend to locals. The burger is just okay, served on a pretzel roll, accompanied by plain fries and a rationed portion of ketchup in a plastic cup.

The chicken limone was pounded flat, cooked dry, with a splash of some kind of sauce that I suppose was lemony at one point in its long life. The baked potato that accompanied it was over-cooked to the point of &#34;are you kidding me?!?&#34; and so was the replacement spud they brought out.

Beer is very cold, taps appear clean, but they are obviously not washing their beer glasses right since there&#39;s no sign of head on any beer delivered.

The place is almost starkly industrial, with TVs as the only wall decoration and the floor done in painted concrete. Metalwork dominates elsewhere.

Service is friendly and rapid.

The beer selection was very good. The list showing the different types available along with a description of the beer was very helpful to find what I liked. I went with the O&#39;Fallon Wheach and the Local Option Blood ov the Kings. Both good choices.

The food was hit and miss though. The Sunday special is $0.50 wings and $5 draft beers so I went with 6 wings to start. I got the &#34;Down and South&#34; wings which are buffalo sauce and a southwest bbq dry rub mixture. The wings were actually very good. They were only the drumettes and no flats. I probably prefer the flats because you can usually get more meat off than you can from the drumettes. The drumettes were very big though, which was a definite plus for the wings.

For an entree, I went with The Frites burger, a cheeseburger with waffle fries and ale-braised onions. I really didn&#39;t get much flavor from the burger. I ordered medium and got more of a medium-well. The lettuce on the side was pretty much wilted by the time it got to me so it didn&#39;t add any crispness that I was looking for. The burger didn&#39;t have a great taste overall.

My gift certificate from Restaurant.com was worth $15, but we were only given $14.50. I thought that was odd, and then I added the bill up and it was off too, by a couple of bucks. Rather than deal with the staff any longer, I paid the bill and got out of there. It wasn&#39;t worth arguing over a couple of bucks, though it was still very odd. 

Overall, I don&#39;t recommend trying this place for anything but having a beer. Seems like the place would be fine for having a beer and watching a game. Avoid dining here though.

On top was a slice of half melted cheese.  I honestly would have rather opened a can of Campbells soup.  I dug out the bread and had a couple spoonfuls of the soup.  I ordered the Chopped Salad with chicken and I asked the waitress if it was truly chopped or just called a chopped salad.  She said it was sort of chopped.  When it was served, it had the biggest pieces of lettuce I have ever had in a salad (not chopped!) and I asked her to take it back and have it chopped.  I apologized for being difficult.  When she brought it back it was slightly, slightly smaller and I told her it was fine.  I know it was not her fault.  The chicken was bland and rubbery.  It was the worst salad I have ever tasted.

This place has very little character.  The decor is nice to look at, dark wood, large rectangular bar...but it&#39;s just so...vanilla.  Very bland and boring.  Not that vanilla is bad, but when something is trying to be an &#34;ale house&#34; rather than a run of the mill family restaurant, it needs a little panache.  Or something.
The service:  okay.  I&#39;ve been here twice I think?  Once for drinks, once for dinner and a drink.  Both times we had decent service.  Our first bartender had the personality of a wet mop, but she did a good job of checking on us and made a decent chocolate martini.  Our bartender the second time around had a very boisterous personality and was great for making food suggestions.
The drink selection is okay, their margarita is very standard, using a mix, served in a pint glass.  Not the type of margarita I&#39;d like more than one of, and frankly, I think their drinks are a little overpriced.  I guess it&#39;s tough sh*t for a cocktail drinker when you&#39;re in an ale house.
The food is forgettable.  I did enjoy the warm pretzels and the spicy mustard it was served with, but I had fish tacos for my main dish and was disappointed.  The fish was very bland.  The tortillas were doubled up and incredibly dry.  I actually tore pieces off the edges so I could eat it..My boyfriend had the fish and chips and liked it.  He also ordered the homemade chips.  I had a couple, and they were nothing great..very standard and quite similar to places like Flagstone.  The caramelized onion dip was not as good as the Dean&#39;s French onion dip you buy at Jewel.  Just sayin.  
I&#39;d return here due to the lack of establishments on the east side, and the fact that their kitchen is open relatively late, but it&#39;s not the best option in town.  I&#39;ll probably try some other items before I write this joint off for good."

About 10 minutes later, the same short man approaches me and asked if I could move my seat to a table! I of course paid my bill and actually left a tip but left abruptly and said a few choice words to this little short man who claimed to be the owner.

Our server got to us quickly for drinks and got our drinks out fast, but that is where the good experience ends. First, the music was way too loud. We were one of only 2 table and some people at the bar in the establishment and had to practically yell to hear each other and for our server to hear us. 
We waited about 10 minutes with our menus closed for our server to come back and take our order. I got the chicken salad sandwich, BIG MISTAKE. The sandwich tasted like I was eating mayo on bread. I tried to scrape some of the mayo off the sandwich with no luck. Our server finally came to check and see how our food was after my friend had finished eating. 
I chose not to get anything else because my friend was already done eating and I didn&#39;t want to risk getting another sandwich like my first one."

I order the buffalo and the devil&#39;s sweat, both flavors are good, but I can never really tell a huge difference between the two other than a bit of spice in the devils sweat. I have also tried the Nachos, the chicken quesadilla, steak tacos and buffalo chicken dip, and again all were good. A little greasy and nothing TOO special but its good for Sunday pigging out. The biggest plus for me it the Bloody Mary Bar! Filled with cheese, olives, tomatoes, and much more.

The house chips are ok and the French onion dip would be great if it wasn&#39;t solid. 
Guacamole also frozen, and loose. Not creamy or even chunky. Thawed out and watery.

Chopped Salad - Blah. cubes of jack cheese are not easy to eat. Dressing is awesome.

Filet Medallions trio - I am not even sure how 4 (yes 4) 1&#34; pieces of pyramidal steak with a bit of breadcrumbs on it equals a trio. Looked completely unappetizing. Side was about 10 pieces of shaved zucchini &amp; yellow squash, and a twice baked potato. The potato was actually a baked potato with a lot of stuff on it, not twice baked. 

Fox Club sandwich - 2 (yes 4 mini sandwiches) that were squashed beyond recognition. Super greasy and lacked any taste.

Smokehouse sandwich - Bacon on a pork sandwich sounds perfect right? Nope. I pulled all the bacon off. Crispy onions were soggy. Pork was meh. Sauce was meh. Waffle fries (1$ extra) were soggy and again obviously frozen.

- Burgers are extremely overpriced (average price is $11.00) and come on &#39;pretzel-type&#39; rolls or buns.  While they weren&#39;t terrible by any means, they weren&#39;t all that great, especially at 11.00.  

(In comparison - much larger and better tasting burgers can be found at Hawthorne&#39;s in West Chicago for an average price of $8.00 with fries, or even a &#34;lunch special&#34; which is available all day every day at Rosati&#39;s in West Chicago - they have a great burger, fries, and can of soda for about $5.75).

- Baked potatos come very small, or as a &#34;half potato&#34; with NO SIDES offered, not even butter.  We had to ask for sour cream.  Who eats plain potatos?

- Steak that one of my family member&#39;s had was very small (price was about 13.99) and like the burgers, worth nowhere near the price.

- Service and waitresses were indeed nice and friendly, but seemed to push &#34;drinks&#34; more than the dinner.  So it seemed to be more of an atmosphere of &#34;drinks and food&#34;, not &#34;food and drinks.&#34;  

- Restaurant itself was clean and nicely decorated, so there are no issues there.  As mentioned, service for us seemed to be pretty good.

Overall though, overly expensive and you don&#39;t get a good bargain for your buck here.  Hence why you see places like Portillo&#39;s (2 blocks up the road) always MOBBED (and Portillo&#39;s is by no means cheapy-cheap, either), and why this place isn&#39;t ever overly crowded.  Most people are going to go where the best bargain is.

I can&#39;t say I&#39;d never come here again, but it&#39;s not on my top list of places..."

Their are several booths and a long bar for you to cheer or scream at the tv. 

The Menu is very limited:

Apps
Burgers
Sandwiches
Taco
Pasta

If you aren&#39;t in the mood for any of those items, then you are out of luck. That being said, this is an Ale House so you shouldn&#39;t be expecting Seared Tuna Salad, etc.

The burgers are premium priced in the $10-$11, but they get credit for being creative in their offerings (i.e. Pork Belly, fried egg, etc.). 

The Pub Chips are a good starter; they come with enough Onion Dip to feed a few Super Bowl Parties.

The Tacos are nicely presented, but the blackened fish preparation definitely needs more blackening. The come with a bowl of buttered rice.

We live 5 minutes from the Spotted Fox. So we&#39;ll likely visit again.

Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth a special trip, but it;s definitely worth a Beer pit stop if you&#39;re catching a movie or shopping nearby."

Anyway - the space is interesting; large with the standard &#34;wall of TV&#39;s&#34; ambience.  Fortunately, the sound was turned down on all of them last night.  (I hope restaurants get away from this decorating scheme someday soon.)  We were seated promptly by the marvelous and courteous staff.  Unfortunately, there was the faint whiff of something unpleasant in the air.  Plumbing issue?  Off-putting, but not bad enough to scare us away.

The entree menu is limited and fairly pedestrian: nothing really screams &#34;foodie destination&#34;.  But - having said that - everywhere you look, there are LARGE, BEAUTIFUL plates of excellent food being delivered to table.  The draft beer selection is staggering.  The plated presentations were pretty to look at, piping hot, and quite delicious.  My only nit to pick would be the slightly heavy hand with the salt; other than that, this just might be one of the Fox Valley&#39;s best new go-to&#39;s for tasty food at a realistic price point.

The GM was doing the table-to-table, and was a very knowledgeable and personable guy.  He seems to really enjoy his work - and it shows.

So - step up from the franchise joints and take a drive over there.  (And try the parmesan crusted chicken with the twice-baked cheesy potato and perfectly cooked broccoli).  I know - sounds BORING - but comfort food at its best.

They do a good job of combining the ease and quickness of a fast food restaurant with the comfort and service of a sit down restaurant.  I went at noon on a Thursday, and was met with a pretty substantial lunch crowd.  Despite the busyness, I was able to easily find a seat and my food arrived quickly.  One of the neat things they do is bring your food out to you.  Which makes this place feel less like fast food and more like a sit in diner.
     When it comes to burgers, I prefer to keep it simple.  As usual, I ordered a cheeseburger with ketchup, mustard, and pickle only, and a side of fries.  As a result, I&#39;m usually always satisfied and I feel like I can more accurately assess each burger using the same criteria.  
     Meatheads offered a pretty good burger, but at its price, it failed to make the grade.  If I&#39;m gonna pay almost 12 dollars for a burger, fries, and a soda, you&#39;ve got to do better than a good fast food burger.  Which is exactly what meatheads offered; they were better than McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, etc., but they failed to compete with the premium joints like five guys, portillo&#39;s, and culver&#39;s.
     Ps, if you&#39;re interested, my top &#34;fast food&#34; burger right now is five guys, followed closely by portillo&#39;s.  I make it a point to search out fast food burger joints, and I&#39;ve tried a pretty good amount.  In &amp; out is probably my least favorite."

They will do a lettuce wrap instead of a bun which is great if you are doing gluten free.  However, I normally end up cutting everything up like a salad because the lettuce wrap is always positioned in a way that falls apart.  Everything tastes good and sometimes that is all that matters.

Normally I share fries with someone.  A small fry serves two and a large can serve 3 or 4.  The fries here are tasty fresh cut style.  You can get them regular or Cajun.  I normally do the regular fries...because they have Ketchupeno for dipping. I love Ketchupeno."

But that really says something, doesn&#39;t it?  I&#39;ve been here twice, once driven by my 20&#39;s daughter who said her boyfriend LOVES this place.  And a second time because we were in the area. The first visit we sat indoors, and it was unremarkable, and a bit loud.  I remember sitting outside the second time, and the food is brought out to you.  The outdoor seating is on the little road, and has a view only of shops.  They have the Freestyle, so you can make one million different sodas.  But the food was not memorable for me.  Tasty enough.  But the competition in this sector is very tough.  There&#39;s now   Kuma&#39;s right nearby.  Portillo&#39;s owns the local sector on food that comes faster and is less expensive.  So where does this fit in?  Not as unique or costly as some, but they are approaching premium burger prices.  And for me, they need to step it up a bit with the food."

It was a crazy busy Saturday night. The cashier was very pleasant and took our order correctly. He was also trying to help a customer who lacked the ability to find a spoon. Once our order was complete, we ventured to find a seat. There was one table with one chair. There was no extra chair in sight so husband stood at the table for a second. 

Helpful short, curly, hair  blonde lady employee helped him out and we got a chair. Food took awhile to arrive but we did get our milkshakes. Those are delish. Now the burgers. I did enjoy my burger but I wouldn&#39;t say it is anything special.  Fries are pretty good as well. The best part was the employees though. Even thought it was a crazy night, the women helped a customer and her special needs child get a table set up for their family, they made sure to check in on us all the time even though they aren&#39;t our waiters

To best test a burger, I went for the basics: mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion on the 1/3 lb meathead, with cheddar cheese. I also ordered the chili cheese fries with chopped onions.

The food came out fairly quickly. The chili cheese fries featured fresh hand cut shoestring potatoes, with a mound of chili and a cheese sauce. I was disappointed with the cheese sauce, but the chili was pretty good. It was milder than I would have liked (I&#39;ve been living in Texas too long), but didn&#39;t have the cumin/chili powder excess some chilis have. 

The burger was, well, okay. Two thin patties with cheese and condiments on a plain bun. Nothing too exciting. Since the patties were thinner, there wasn&#39;t the juicy mess that corresponds to what one would think of a 1/3 lb patty. This was more of an imitation of an In-and-Out Double Double, without the melting cheese and greasy mess that makes the Double Double such an iconic burger. 

Although I like the optics of Meatheads, it isn&#39;t anything to go crazy over."

I think I will give it at least one more shot but this time I&#39;ll try their chicken.  It looks really good and people have recommended that.

I would compare the place to the gourmet burger places that are so popular now.  I&#39;d rank this behind smash burger and five guys.  Their burger really reminded me of five guys but not quite as much flavor.  The fries were way behind five guys though so that makes the comparison much easier.

The customer service I need to note us exceptionally good.  I give plenty of credit to workers like this that give you a great experience."

So after fighting for holiday parking at the streets of Woodfield, I saw the sign for Meatheads which seemed oddly appropriate considering my earlier purchases.    So I knew I had to check it out for lunch.

I decided to get the burger to go.    The decor definitely gave me a Smashburger / Five Guys vibe.    There was a small crowd in front of me.    I was pleasantly surprised to hear a customer request unsalted fries and the lady behind the counter complying.
I&#39;m not opposed to salt but hate how liberally it&#39;s applied to fries in general at any burger joint.

So when my time came up, I made the same request.   Since I ordered to go, I stood on the side with my number, which had the cool fact that only 8% of all U.S. beef can be classified as Angus.   I made a custom burger of honey mustard, pickles, grilled onions, and ketchup.    Pretty basic ingredients.

Customer service was very good from the lady taking my order to the one who delivered it to me.

The order took around ten minutes, which was fine.   The burger itself didn&#39;t really have any flavor to it.   I&#39;m assuming the condiments is where they expect the flavors to pop and perhaps I should&#39;ve ordered one of their limited custom burgers.   With that said it was an okay burger.    It is cool they offer a lettuce burger for the Adkins crowd.

The fries wound up being salted though which was a disappointment considering my request.    Maybe I might&#39;ve gotten residual salt from the trays itself, which if that&#39;s the case, definitely shows that they put way too much salt to begin with.   On the flip side, they give you plenty of fries so no complaints in that department."

Now that I have been to both, Meatheads is the winner. I ordered a 1/3 lb patty melt with seasoned fries. The quality and freshness was impressive, the meat was tender and juicy while the fries were crunchy without excessive oil. I also ordered a vanilla shake which was good but nothing mind blowing. The price at $13 for all three items seemed reasonable as the meat is organic. The service was quick with a server bringing out your food and cleaning up your table afterwards.

The interior is very clean and casual; the first thing that caught my eye is a Coke Freestyle machine (hello, Strawberry Fanta Zero!).  My boyfriend is a HUGE fan of Coke Freestyle, so I made a mental note to recommend this place to him---after trying the food, of course.

I ordered a 1/2 pound burger with American cheese, regular fries, a side of Bistro sauce, and a soft drink.  My food came to my table pretty quickly; I probably waited about 8 minutes.  The fries were pretty tasty, especially with the Bistro sauce (which to me, tastes like a spicy thousand island dressing).  The burger was pretty good, but very greasy.  I mean, grease and condiments dripping off of the burger, down your arm, on the table.  Sometimes I enjoy a messy burger (today being one of those times), but beware for those who don&#39;t.

I did not order any milkshakes because I was stuffed.  But I definitely will next time!

Looking forward to returning with my Coke-Freestyle-loving, burger fan of a boyfriend!"

This is probably the most important detail from my visit this week. I was in the area at lunchtime for a continuing education class. We were on day number two and I wanted something I hadn&#39;t tried before. A girlfriend suggested Meatheads and off we went. 

Parking at 12:15pm on a Thursday wasn&#39;t as bad as I would have imagined. There was no line and we quickly made some decisions. 1/3 burgers for both of us. Get toppings included some cheese and other things that aren&#39;t exactly up my alley. I went with bacon, grilled onions and BBQ sauce on the side. She tried the Cajun fries while I stuck with the regular ones. 

I tried the Coke Freestyle machine. It was cool. I was hoping for caffeine free regular Coke that I could turn into caffeine free cherry Coke, but alas there was no caffeine free regular Coke. Maybe someday Coca Cola will answer my plea...

We grabbed a corner booth and waited with our little order numbers. Both orders came out quickly. Hers was wrong. Her mayo was missing and I think the tomato didn&#39;t make the plate either. She mentioned it to me, but we were under a bit of a time constraint and so she ate it as is. She loved the Cajun fries!!  I tried a couple and thought they were pretty good too. My burger had a nice serving of bacon. But some of it was cooked perfectly and some of it was charred. I like crispy bacon. That&#39;s often how I order it. But this seemed like some pieces were scrapped off the bottom of the pan after being in there way too long. The grilled onions were not really grilled but rather just greasy onions. My regular fries were hot, nice and crispy and just very good. Neither or us were fans of the double patty of meat that seemed dry and under seasoned. 

A gal came by and asked how everything was but before we could say anything or even acknowledge her presence, she was gone. It was like she was meeting her quota of asking, but not waiting for a response. A manager in a dress shirt came by to ask the same question, but he was very nice and waited for the response. He also cleared our plates once we were done. I like a manager who gets out there and does what needs to be done. Someone who isn&#39;t afraid to get their hands dirty. 

If I&#39;m in the area, I might have some fries, try a shake or try their chicken next time. The burger just didn&#39;t do it for me."

BURGER - 3 - greasy as hell. this coming from a guy who says grease is healthy bc it helps us digest food. i consider something &#34;greasy&#34; when its dripping at a regular rate from the burger. its a shame since the burger was constructed really well too like at in-n-out

FRIES - 5 - can&#39;t really get any better than they do. hand cut it seemed. normal thickness, not shoestring but not steak fries either

CHICKEN TENDERS - 5 - again quite stellar and the batter/coating was extremely flavorful and just right. they use their own mix but its not some boring no flavor coating. very meaty and hot.

I&#39;m in Schaumburg from out of town (all the way from California), so I&#39;ve never been to a Meatheads ever. Are they a chain even? I&#39;m not entirely sure. Anyway, I walked up to the menu board completely unsure of what I was in the mood for. The girl behind the counter was extremely helpful in making suggestions, which I always appreciate. She asked a lot of great questions to really help us order what we really wanted (which ended up being a basket each of regular and cajun fries), and her menu knowledge was impeccable! But I think what really impressed me was her attention to detail when actually serving the food. She could have easily dropped it and never come back (which I wouldn&#39;t have held against her given the style of restaurant). Nevertheless, she came back around to check in and even offered to toss the nearly full basket of regular fries in the cajun seasoning after discovering the cajun basket was almost empty!

I was thinking that as I went to yet another gourmet burger chain (at least the third in the western suburbs). Meatheads competes with the likes of Tom and Eddies and Smashburger, and does a good job of it.

I had a Californian, while my wife had a Hawaiian burger. The Californian was quite good - you can never go wrong when an avocado is in your burger, even if sliced and falls out of the burger. The wasabi sauce gave it just a bit of heat, but more importantly made the burger not just taste like meat and avocadoes.

What I remember about my wife&#39;s Hawaiian was that the pineapple was marinated and tasty.

The fries were standard fare, so far as I remember; nothing to write home about. Perhaps I&#39;ll try the chili cheese fries next time."

My family went to legoland around the corner for my sons impromptu 3rd birthday and instead of paying $10 for a deli sandwich and a juice box we called meatheads to see if they were ok to bring our party there... Last minute. They totally accommodated us, even put out reserved signs for us. And even though we came in hours later, they welcomed us and helped us  steer all the kids in- having the little kids craft ready for them. As far as service goes, they seemed to genuinely enjoy that we were there and made our chaos feel welcome. They got the food out very quickly and put some assembly to us. 

As far as quality of food, de-licious! The burgers were well made. Easily comparable to five guys and smash burger. (Granted I&#39;m not a fan of either of those places for different reasons.) I love that they have integrity in the quality of food and give great suggestions for burger options. Chili Cheese fries would bring me back by themselves. The kids all finished all their food. The chicken tenders were so moist and flavorful, hot dog was huge. They even allowed us to bring in our own cake but provided everything else for us- including the lighter. 

When it comes down to it, price was good, food was great, service was exceptional. It&#39;s great to go to a place that is truly kid friendly but not a kids restaurant.."

These were some tasty fries that they had here, especially the Cajun fries. They were full of real potato flavor and the Cajun seasonings just added to it nicely, not overpowering. Texture, flavor, temperature of fries: pretty close to perfect.  I got the Californian burger and it was very good but I do wish that the patty itself was thicker (juiciness factor) so next time I will get a thicker burger. The cucumber was wasabi sauce on the sandwich was great and it was also good for dipping a couple fries. 

This location was the first one I&#39;ve ever been to and I will be back. For those that don&#39;t know, it&#39;s set up as counter where you place your order, they give you a number and then they bring it to your table. They were very speedy even on this busy Saturday during lunch time at such a busy location- and right next to Legoland!

I don&#39;t care much for ketchup (I know, very un-American) but next time I&#39;ll try the Ketchipotle. How cute! Oh, and the banana split shake sounded good, too!"

I was a bit apprehensive to try out this Streets of Woodfield goodie...and I don&#39;t really know why. Perhaps the opportunity for disappointment? Truth be told, my expectations were mediocre at best, but the two burgers I sampled exceeded those expectations. WIN. 

Meatheads is a pretty straightforward burger (and chicken and shakes and sides) bar. Order up at the counter, grab your number, snag your overly sugared Coke Freestyle machine made bevvie and have a seat. Hubs and I went halvsies on two specialty burgers: the Californian and the Hawaiian. What can I say...we were feeling coasty. 

Both burgers were equally as tasty - The California featuring avocado, pepperjack cheese and a fancy wasabi aioli. It had a perfectly delightful kick! The Hawaiian was stacked with jalapeno, pineapple and BBQ sauce. While I initially had a bit of trepidation wrapping my head around the pineapple/beef/jalapeno combination, it ended up rounding out the flavors quite well. Both burgers are certainly worth trying.

Size wise, these burgers were moderate - a nice weight for me but I think Todd W might have left a little hungry as we went sans sides. Also, worth noting that the burger itself is a bit pricey at $6+ each. Extra points for all natural burgers and no freezers, though. At least if I&#39;m wolfing down saturated fat it&#39;s all natural!"

They honestly have some of the best customer service of any fast food type of joint ever. Aside from bringing all of the food out for you, they bring anything you may have forgot. I asked for mayo (it&#39;s a white person thing, apparently) and bah bam! Brought to my table.

I paid $6.41 for a Lil Meatheads kid&#39;s meal. This is honestly a good size because you get a one patty burger, a good amount of fries and a tiny drink. Dining in, the tiny sized drink doesn&#39;t matter though because there are free refills! Yay! The cheese on my burger cost me an extra $1. :( I don&#39;t like being charged so much extra for cheese. Even 50 cents would seem more acceptable. But honestly that just means in the future I will not be getting cheese! I can&#39;t justify the extra dollar just for cheese!

My burger was the bomb diggy though as usual. That bacon ranch sauce is just awesome but I think I&#39;m going to try the bleu cheese next time since I won&#39;t be doing the cheese slices. The fries are also off the hook with a little sauce (you can get any of the sauces for your fries that you got for your burger). 

I always come during weekday lunches with my lunch crew and we have never encountered a crowd during the 11 to 12 hour. It may get busier later but we never have any issues with seating.

In the 5 Guys Vs. Meatheads, Meatheads still reigns supreme for me. I am not a big beef eater and I really love their burgers. I don&#39;t know what kind of buns they use but it&#39;s a bit different and it just adds to the yummy flavor."

I finally took the plunge and tried it out the other day. I would compare them to a SmashBurger or Five Guy&#39;s. It&#39;s a burger and fry joint that has chicken sandwiches and shakes as well. 

I decided to try the California Burger. It was juicy, dripping with pepper jack cheese, and topped with a wasabi sauce and avocado. It&#39;s better (by far) than a burger from McDonald&#39;s or Burger King. They are a little pricey (a little over $6 for a burger alone), but it is about what you would pay at a sit-down restaurant. You can take it to-go or stay in and eat. 

They have 2 types of fries as well - regular or cajun. The Cajun have just enough of a zing to keep in interesting, but they aren&#39;t too hot. ]

A good place to go for a juicy burger to satisfy your craving!"

So I bookmarked it for the future. Meatheads to me is like any other burger bar but alike those that range in the same market as Five Guys or the Counter. Per advertising; Meatheads boasts using fresh Angus beef (which is never frozen), fresh baked buns and fresh cut fries; they also make hand dipped milk shakes. 

One can compose their own burger with an array of options or choose from one of their specialty burgers. Some of their more interesting toppings: sauerkraut, jalapenos, roasted red peppers, mushrooms and pineapple! These are considered free toppings. Meatheads also offers a variety of sauces available upon request and which come atop their specialty burgers. Sauces which grasped my attention; cucumber wasabi and Thousand Island. On the side they offer a few different hot sauces and interesting ketchup / hot sauce concoctions most of us may have seen at our local grocers. 

Meat patties are thin and could be hand formed so if you are the average eater that often packs their meal to go, I would suggest going for a double. I chose the Cajun sunrise burger because it contained a fried egg, pepper jack cheese, jalapeno slices, bacon, blue cheese sauce, lettuce and tomato. It may sound like a lot, but with a single patty it isn&#39;t much when contained within buttered buns, we accompanied this feat with chili cheese fries. (Photos are uploaded) The chili and cheese went well together but were mild. The burger was built perfectly, but hardly satisfied my afternoon appetite. With drink I rounded out to about twelve and a half dollars. That&#39;s uber pricey for a burger bar. I could have done it cheaper by going with regular fries. All in all, pretty good stuff. But after having spent that much money and not feeling full, I left feeling disappointed. 

Service goes out of their way to make sure your visit is a happy one.  Meatheads is a chain whose beginnings started in Illinois and as of late has been spreading out up North.  What they have going for them is good leadership and one that&#39;s keeping a watchful eye on striving to keep things going well.  Kudos to the expanding business.  

Are they better than Five guys?  Not sure yet, have to try them again with double patty action.  Offering fried eggs and jalapenos has my attention."

After posting my review, I received an email from someone at Meatheads who showed genuine concern about some of my comments.  We decided to give it another chance.  This time, they came through with flying colors.

For fun, I ordered both a 1/3 lb burger and a foot long hot dog.  My wife also got a burger with fries.  I&#39;d been really craving a hot dog for some time and this was my chance.  They serve Vienna Beef all beef dogs. Like their hamburgers, you can get pretty much whatever you want on the dog.  Being from New Jersey originally, I like my hot dogs New York style - simply mustard and relish.  They grill their hot dogs on a flat top.  So much better than the boiled or steamed dogs at other places.  Also, they serve it on a New England split top bun - a nice change from the typical.

My hamburger was pretty loaded and very good - if I remember right - mustard, ketchup, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, red peppers, and jalapenos.   The fries are hand cut and crispy.  

One other point of note - their drink machines have many, many combinations.  For example, you can get Coca-Cola with vanilla, chocolate, cherry, lemon and several other flavors.  I believe you can do the same with other soda brands too.

Meatheads, you have redeemed yourself and I look forward to my next visit."

For example, I don&#39;t reflect back on my experience as either exceptional or atrocious. It was good, and I would go again, but I don&#39;t think I would make the trek to Schaumburg solely to have a Meathead burger.

I went with two friends and we each got different burgers. I got the Hawaiian burger, Cajun fries, and a featured milkshake. My two buddies only got burgers - no fries and no milkshake. I guess I&#39;m the piggie of the three of us. No matter - I&#39;ll still eat with pride and sparkle.

I digress. I was pleased that a short conversation at the counter helped me to get a kiddie sized Hawaiian burger (certainly more manageable for me). The burger came with a pineapple ring and lots of freshly sliced jalapenos. The patty was pretty thin. I hungrily ate most of my burger with the jalapenos and then had to scrape them off for the last two bites. They just got to be too much. My huger must have clouded my taste buds in the beginning. My Cajun fries were tasty and the shake was okay. My pals really didn&#39;t say too much about their burgers.

In regards to the atmosphere and the service: it was super casual. As I said before, we ordered at a counter and then our food was brought to our table. The tables were squeezed pretty tightly together and business was bustling. My friends liked the touchscreen pop dispenser. A manager (at least I assume it was the manager) came and checked on us. Other employees readily cleared our table as we finished.

I think that if I went to Shaumburg, that I&#39;d rather go to Smashburger over Meatheads. Maybe I&#39;ll convince my friends the next time I visit them."

They have chipotle and jalapeno ketchup which wasn&#39;t so great.

The fries are thicker than the shoestring fries at Smashburger but are kinda boring. They don&#39;t have an option for sweet potato fries.

Pricing is similar to Smashburger.

They don&#39;t have craft beers or any beers at all so that automatically gives Smashburger the advantage.

Parking SUCKS and is dangerous in the lots of Streets of Woodfield.

I found them to be OK the first time, but quite messy. After returning, I think my opinion is slightly higher, but not by much. I don&#39;t think they are bad at all, just not as good as some other burger places in the area. It wasn&#39;t as messy this time, but we still had to be extra careful not to get sauce and juice on our clothing. My friend experienced the same trouble I had, though. Sauce was running down his hand and wrists. I don&#39;t think the bun holds up that well to all the condiments. You pick up the burger and the contents immediately begin to slide out.

This time the fries were better. We ordered the chili cheese fries. They were pretty good and my burger was decent. However, the most flavorful thing on it was the sliced onion. I came back excited to try the Bacon Ranch Sauce and was quite sad to find it lacked flavor. If you hadn&#39;t told me there was bacon in it then I&#39;d never have guessed. In fact, it didn&#39;t even taste that much like ranch. If you put a ton of toppings on my burger then I expect an explosion of flavor. I just didn&#39;t get that, but it was still a good burger.

I&#39;m going to have to stick with my original three star rating. I think the food is decent and the prices are pretty standard for mid-level gourmet grill. I just think that what I&#39;ve ordered seems like a fancy Wendy&#39;s. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Wendy&#39;s. They are probably the freshest/healthiest of the fast food burger places. This is definitely a step up from that. It&#39;s reliable. It hits the spot and I&#39;m not opposed to returning. It&#39;s conveniently located within the same shopping center as the AMC. Great for dinner and a movie among friends. But if I&#39;m spending $20+ for two burgers, a single side and a single drink then I&#39;d like a little more bang for my buck in the flavor department."

This time around I went for their Chicken Sandwich and shared some fries with my fiance.  On my chicken sandwich, I added cucumber wasabi sauce, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce for free, and provolone cheese for $1 more.  The flavor combination was similar to the Californian but with chicken of course, a different cheese, some onions and no cucumber or avocado.  

What my new verdict?!?!  The sandwich was... okay!  Really, acceptable, from what I was expecting.  Each bite I was able to taste the toppings that I selected.  That was good.  As for the main component of the sandwich, the chicken, it was juicy, just the right size, but unfortunately just a tiny bit salty.  I wish they had an option for a different type bun, perhaps a pretzel bun, as it could soak all the juices and such.  It also probably could have balanced the said chicken too. But this instance might have been an off day.  It was alright, it didn&#39;t deter me from finishing it.  Just  happy their drinks are self-service aka refillable!

Anyway,  this visit I also discovered their different types of ketchup (habanero and chipotle).  Did they add to my fries/sandwich experience?  Slightly.  I enjoyed trying them and that&#39;s pretty much it.

A few aspects I enjoyed once again were their music choice, promptness of service, cleanliness, and chill atmosphere.

Overall, would I go here again? It wouldn&#39;t be my first choice, but its fine.  The quality is in between fast food drive-in places and a full dining service place like Friday&#39;s; but the prices are still in line with the Friday&#39;s side of the spectrum."

I usually get the 1/3 to 1/2lb meathead burger with cheese and most of the toppings, and usually add a fried egg for a little extra $.  (That fried eggs makes a world of difference).  Cajun Fries with a side of cheese.  I love the seasoning of the fries and how they come out hot and fresh. And I also enjoy the touch screen soda dispensers that allow a myriad of combinations (orange diet coke....... awesome, no more manually mixing orange Fanta and diet coke on my own!).

With the recent addition of Smashburger  and 5 Guys now we have Meatheads. Now I haven&#39;t tried Smashburger yet so ill hold back on really bashing any of them....yet. I will say this - this place serves a damn good burger and fries.

Unlike 5 Guys they execute the cooking of the burger better. Perfectly seasoned - unlike most places! Also the free toppings are a bonus. It sucks that you have to pay more for cheese and bacon but you can&#39;t win them all.

We got a couple burger obviously with some cajun fries. I like mine spicy so i opted for the jalapenos, mushrooms, grilled onions, and pepperjack. I would say that it would have worked better if the peppers were pickled and not fresh. The girlfriend got a more basic one with the bacon ranch sauce on it. Although it sounds good the bacon ranch lacked the punch to get through all the toppings and the burger itself. The highlight I think was the wasabi ranch that we got on the side to dip the fries in. 

So far the best execute burger from these new chains. I would choose this over 5 Guys for now not only for quality but also for the price - it was more affordable especially when your trying to grasp the idea your only getting a burger and fries. Oh yah and don&#39;t miss out on the wasabi ranch its killer."

My intention was to only have 1/2 of my burger but I ended up finishing that bad boy and it was GREAT. I don&#39;t like too many fixings on my burger and that was just fine because I was able to wholeheartedly enjoy it in all of its simple glory. :-)

One of them said someone else had told her about Meatheads, so we decided to give it a try.

Lots of options for their burgers. They have six &#34;set&#34; burgers that you can modify to your liking, and then they also present a categorized list of all possible burger ingredients so that you can build your own. There&#39;s the regular meathead, which is two patties; and the lil meathead, which is one patty.

Everything is made to order and delivered hot and fresh to your table. It was all very good. I wouldn&#39;t say the burger combinations themselves are unusual or novel, but the quality is very good. 

Service is always a big one for me, and Meathead delivers well. The cashiers kindly and patiently explained the menu and options to me, and the gentleman who delivered our food brought it with a smile, and the manager stopped by to see how we were doing and to ask if we needed anything else.

If you&#39;re in the Woodfield area and need to grab food, this is a good place for a quick, tasty meal."

My 1/2 pound burger was actually three 1/6 pound burgers served on one bun. They were cooked to death, dry and chewy.  Steak and Shake serves a triple burger which is a close rival.  Had I know it was not one juicy 1/2 # chunk  of ground beef I would not have ever gone thru the door.  The fries were OK, similar to 5 Guys.  The music is mind numbingly loud so bring your earplugs.  The bottom line is that there are MUCH better burgers such as Smashburger and Fuddruckers nearby.  However, if you like your ground beef cooked  &#34;country style&#34; ( i.e., very well done) then this is the place for you!"

As other reviews have mentioned, this is pretty similar to Five Guys. It&#39;s sort of the Qdoba versus Chipotle debate -- Meatheads being the Qdoba. Same basic idea, a few more options.

The burgers come in three sizes: 1/4 lb (&#34;lil meathead&#34;), 1/3 lb, and 1/2 lb. They&#39;re thinner and griddled, with nice edges while still being juicy and just a wee bit pink in the middle. The fries are nice and crispy, a bit thinner than Five Guys&#39;, done just right.

There are a huge amount of toppings, including many cheeses, veggies galore, bacon, egg, and about seven different sauces. Most are free; cheese &amp; egg are $1, bacon is .75c, as is avocado. Fries come in regular and large -- a large is plenty for 2 people to share -- and cajun and regular. Good to know: they have cajun seasoning on the condiment bar if you want it on the side. They also have malt vinegar, hot sauce, A-1, etc.

While it&#39;s not dirt cheap, this is good food, considerably better than your average quickie burger joint, made with real ingredients -- a good value for the menu. We got a 1/4 lb and 1/3 lb burger, cheese and bacon on one, and a large fry - about $14 and we left full and happy. (P.S. To really save money? Drink water. Everyone knows soda&#39;s prices are jacked up.)

And just to ice the cake -- they have temporary cow tattoos! Which, I might add, has lasted over 12 hours now."

The burger is good, the fries are good.  To me, the burger is better than Smash, but not as good as Five Guys.  The fries are better than Five Guys, but not as good as Smash (rosemary - regular smash fries are gross).

BRING LOTS OF MONEY.
It&#39;s expensive. VERY expensive. For my 4 year old daughter, my husband and myself - it was nearly $35. We just got three meals and three drinks. Don&#39;t get the bottled drinks if you want to save money, get the High Fructose Corn Syrup Soda.

DON&#39;T EXPECT A SUPERSIZED BURGER FOR THE SUPERSIZED PRICE.
Been to a Steak N Shake recently? Well, imagine a burger with smaller patties then those, that cost twice as much. No, I&#39;m not kidding. 

DO EXPECT AWESOME FRIES.
The Cajun fries were to die for, much better than &#34;Five Guys&#34; Fries. And there were many of them!

DO EXPECT AWESOME SERVICE.
Their service was great. Friendly, approachable -- and they got my order right. Which, if you&#39;ve read any of my other reviews - you&#39;ll see I have many issues with ordering plain bacon cheeseburgers. 

All in all, if you have the cash to blow - go here. But don&#39;t expect a bang for your buck."

At Meatheads, the burgers are good, the fries are some of my favorites out of all the fast food places around here, and their milkshakes are amazing. I&#39;ve tried the banana split shake, chocolate and coffee, and every one has been delicious. Pair that up with a very friendly and attentive staff and this is probably my favorite burger place in the area. I can even get Starbucks across the sidewalk afterwards, which is always nice after a meal.

The only downside is parking is constantly congested at this place, especially during prime time hours, but any other time is well worth the trip."

The cucumber wasabi is really good on burgers and with fries.  Their fries are really good too and you get a good amount.  Crispy and thin, unlike another burger joint in the area.  

They&#39;ll basically customize any burger with their list of ingredients.  I even ordered a bacon cheese hot dog once.  They guy brought it out and said he&#39;d never seen that before, but that it looked delicious.  And it totally was, especially since they loaded it with crispy bacon.

I was right. But given their name and their specialty (meat dripping hamburgers), I won&#39;t hold it against them.

First, the atmosphere is nice. The restaurant is open, airy and has good karma. The staff is friendly and attentive.

I ordered a &#34;burger&#34; with only avocado (Mmmm!), lettuce, tomatoes and onions. It came divided into little triangles with toothpicks holding everything together. I really liked this as it made the burger easier to eat. It was nice to have a burger, without the meat patty, that&#39;s not just random ingredients slapped on 2 hamburger buns.

The ingredients tasted fresh. No wilting lettuce or mushy tomatoes. The bread wasn&#39;t stale or anything. So in all, it was a very tasty meal.

I also ordered a side of french fries. The fries come out on a huge plate and there was enough for all 4 of us on that one order. The fries were good. Not soggy. Not too salty. Not burned or overcooked. They could&#39;ve used a little more &#34;zest&#34; but nothing I&#39;m going to complain about.

Meatheads kinda reminds me of a mini Culvers. I like how you basically customize your own burger with the list of ingredients posted behind the cashier. 

My one big complaint about Meatheads is that it is pretty pricey for a burger joint - over $10 per person. The prices are preventing me from giving this place 5 stars.

I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go to Meatheads. It&#39;s not really a &#34;destination&#34; restaurant. Rather, if I&#39;m in an area and there&#39;s a Meatheads around, I&#39;d definitely go there.

P.S. I was here on a Saturday night. The entire Woodfield area was PACKED and parking was almost impossible. Just something to keep in mind."

I considered giving the place one  star, but the service here is super friendly. 

Apart from the stellar service, not much else can be described with such positive terms. The place is crowded, and although you get some cool burger customization choices and different sauces for your fries, that&#39;s where the fun ends. 

The burger has two thin patties and it&#39;s incredibly greasy; even more so with cheese. You really don&#39;t taste much apart from the napkin to wipe the grease off your lips....

My buddies split a large fry and sent it back because it was too salty. Honestly, when three guys under 30 complain about food being too salty, something is awry. My own fries weren&#39;t as bad as theirs, but still saline to the point I decided not to finish them for the sake of not developing heart disease that day. 

If someday I should return here, maybe I&#39;d have one of their &#34;famous&#34; hot dogs. Otherwise, their burgers (which are supposed to be their forte) are a giant fail."

My husband and I were invited to dinner today by someone and we were to meet him at 8 pm, due to the heavy rain coming in, we decided to head out earlier since we live about 30 min away.  We arrived at the restaurant about 7:30 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty other than 1 family sitting and another one that joined in a little later.  We were seated right away, and the first thing i noticed was the nice interior furniture as well as the lighting, which was a great improvement from the last restaurant that was housed there.  We decided to wait for our friend to order and in the mean time decided to check out their menu (which is not specific to one thing...you can find south indian, north indian, chinese , everything mixed in) We decided it would be fine to wait to order since the restaurant was empty; its not like we were holding up a table for a crowd of people waiting to come in.  At about  8 pm, a guy in a black shirt, who I assume is the manager from the many other google reviews I read online, came up to us very sarcastically and asked if we were going to order and if someone was even coming and then he added , &#39;well hopefully he gets here before 10 because we close at 10.&#39;  in no way was he trying to tell a joke, he was rudely sarcastic. We felt so bad that we just decided to order two drinks, my husband ordered a mango lassi and I ordered the almond milk.  As soon as we ordered it, within seconds, we had the drink in our hand.  now, you might think this is great service...but ...these drinks were pre-made and placed into plastic cups and put in a fridge.  We didn&#39;t think much since i&#39;m sure many places don&#39;t make these things right away.  The drinks were definitely good, so thats 1 plus for them.  Our friend finally arrived a few minutes later, and you could see the manager and all the staff just in shock.  When one of the waiters came over, I told him,&#39; you guys thought no one was coming right? &#34; He just smirked and said nothing.  Now , lets get to the food...not a fan AT ALL.  We travel a lot due to the businesses we own and we eat and different places from hole in the wall to 5 star restaurants ...and this food was just awful....too spicy ....the flavor was not flattering...our appetizer seemed too crispy....and let me add...our appetizer came in...followed by 1 of our entree dishes...and then a few minutes later...another entree dish...and a few minutes later....another entree...followed by at least 15 minutes and here comes the naan .  Aren&#39;t restaurants supposed to bring all the entrees in together? Also, let me tell you, when we asked about some dishes...we were told it would take 25 minutes to make.  Oh, and did i mention that when my husband asked to try the Limca drink, he was rudely told, &#39; no we wont have that, we have lemonade &#39;.  I pointed out that on their menu it said they serve Limca. If you didn&#39;t have it, why be rude? Why not just say, oh i&#39;m sorry, unfortunately we are out.  

I read a lot of google reviews on this place...and I wish i had read it prior to going into this restaurant....the manager was RUDE....the service was awful ....although the guy in the glasses that served us was trying to be nice as much as he knew how to....the food was awful.  

I would avoid this place ....let me also add..if you are an Indian restaurant....why cater to just one type of Indian community? The majority of the time we were there...they had Tamil videos playing....finally ...maybe after hearing us...they changed it to hindi songs that everyone can enjoy .  

I don&#39;t see this restaurant lasting long here...and i can def. understand why it wasn&#39;t crowded at all for dinner."

I usually get Indian food at least a couple times a month.  I had never been to Bawarchi, so I decided to give it a try for lunch.  When on a road trip down in Florida I saw Apollo fish on a menu at another restaurant.  I was traveling with my Indian friend, Syed, and he was amazed he saw that fish in an American restaurant.  We hardly ever see it anywhere.  Well Bawarchi had it so I had to give it a try!  I got the Apollo fish, butter chicken, garlic naan, and rice.  I ordered for takeout.  It took about 20 minutes to get my food, which is what they told me it would take.

When I walked in, I was greeted by a friendly lady behind the counter, and I also was greeted by two other workers.  All very friendly and smiles on their faces.  The interior is nice and clean.

So now to the food.  I live very close to here, so I was home and eating within about 5 minutes of leaving the restaurant.  The food was good.  The single gripe I have is the Apollo fish was cold and tough - not anywhere close to how I remembered.  But, that is probably just due to me taking it home and it cooling a bit.  The butter chicken was still super hot, almost too hot to touch the container.  Everything was tasty.  I did ask for spicy.  They could have made it even more spicy for me, but, perhaps they thought I couldn&#39;t handle it lol.  Next time I&#39;ll tell them to make it even more spicy.

Overall I&#39;d give the food 3 stars, service was good and friendly.  I am going to give my total review 4 stars for now.  As I go here more, I will update if there is a need to.

***Update.  Down to 2 stars.  I got takeout here for dinner - 2nd order on same day.  Went with Syed and we got Apollo fish (he wanted to give it a try even though I said I wasn&#39;t impressed) and a shrimp dish.  Again pickup order.  Got home in same time and the Apollo fish was way different this time.  Soft, hot, and super tasty.  I am disappointed at how different the same fish was at 2 different times of the same day.  The first one was simply horrible, but, the 2nd order was very good.  Consistency is key."

First off you must know this is not a fine dine, fancy overpriced experience, some people are used to with Indian Cuisine. But its like a mom and pop simple spot, where you can get authentic food with bold flavors at a reasonable price. It might not be for everyone, like I said the flavors are bold, can be spicy but if that&#39;s what you like, your in for a treat. The menu is pretty extensive, heavy on the south Indian side. Food comes pretty fast. Infact the take out line was just as long as the amount of people in the restaurant. The Avacai biryani was some of the best I have ever had. In the end this is more of a fast food spot, less restaurant. Kinda like a better expanded south indian version of Ghareeb Nawaz.. Take that anyway you like it."

I came here with my friend for lunch one day. They sat us down right away and we looked over the menu. They had some great lunch special deal that I would go back for again. I didn&#39;t really know what any of the items were on the specials (my friend ended up ordering one and it was a vast array of dishes - it looked so good!), so I went with my usual, butter chicken with naan bread. It was delicious! 

The waiter also brought over 2 free drinks for us to try. One was a mango smoothie, and the other was like a chai or spiced rice milk. Both were very good, and it was nice of him to let us try the drinks. 

Overall the food was great and at a great price. I just wished they would describe what the items are on their menu. Also, they don&#39;t have samosas if you are looking for them here (I think this is more southern Indian? Don&#39;t quote me on that)."

Unfortunately, we did not have as good of an experience as others here. We ordered take-out on a Sunday night for tandoor chicken and a masala dosa.

After waiting for a half hour(reasonable, no complaints about that) we were so excited to eat our food. We get home to eat, and ended up being so disappointed. 

The tandoor chicken was super dry and actually pieces of it were slightly burnt. Not so tasty....

On the other hand, the masala in the dosa was delicious. It was warm and flavorful and just right. Sadly, the dosa itself was stale/dry.

Maybe it was just the night we came on or maybe we just ordered the wrong items from the place. Either way, we ended up very dissapointed, and will stick to our favorite places in the area instead."

We ordered tandoori chicken, kadhai paneer and chicken biryani. The guy who was taking the order said there are 2 leg pieces and 2 chicken breasts but it was only 2 drumsticks and 2 breast pieces, so that was a little misleading. None-the-less, the chicken was delicious. Kadhai paneer was also good - just as expected, hot n spicy. Chicken biryani was one of the best. They had nice big chunks of chicken - bone in. The spices were to the point. The rice itself was very yummy.

We are definitely going back, yet to dine in and may be sometime soon that will happen too."

We ordered the fish curry, butter chicken, garlic naan, and chicken biryani.  I had my heart set on a sweet lassi but unfortunately, they were out. 

Anyway, the quantity and quality of the food in comparison to the price was unbelievable.  The naan was buttery, soft, and perfectly chewy.  The butter chicken was loaded with chicken pieces, and the fish curry had the right amount of zing and flavor.  Both of these gravy dishes came with huge sides of plain  basmati rice which had superb taste and aroma in itself.  I had really high hopes for the biryani, but it just seemed a little over-spiced for my preference.  The rice and chicken in it, however, were excellently cooked. 

The decor is very aesthetically pleasing as well.  I loved their light pieces, very modern! 

Overall, I will definitely be back.  Bawarchi, don&#39;t you change one thing!"

The menu has overall good selection of food and service is fairly quick. It was just two of us and we ordered one appetizer - Baby corn manchurian, the chicken tikka masala, naan and chicken boneless briyani.

Other than the briyani, everything else was good. I was personally disappointed by the briyani because the rice was mixed with boneless chicken tikka pieces, so it wasn&#39;t like chicken was cooked with rice (which is what I expected), but it still tasted good."

Waiteress was very friendly and volunteered to help/suggest from the menu. When I looked around, the other person at the counter also walked up, asking if he could help. They leave extra napkins and cutlery on an extra plate - rather than leave the cutlery, un-hygienically, on the table. Even when they brought us knives, they set them resting on our plates and not on the table. Nice to see such level of detail for hygiene. 

I ordered, mostly based on the Waitresses recommendation of what was popular at Bawarchi. 

Chicken 555: 5 star. Yes, it is about as good as it gets, for this type of dish. I have tried similar dishes in India and this is as good as I would find in India. This is very similar to Chicken 65, a popular and common appetizer in Indian restaurants. In fact, I met the guy who came up with the dish Chicken 65 - he said it was item #65 in his menu.. many years ago, at his restaurant in Hyderabad, India. Chicken 555 was as good - it is a dry, deep fried chicken dish and was superb.  Even though I have given a 3 star over all rating, I think there might be a good possibility that Bawarchi would have more 5 star deserving appetizers. 

Chicken dum Biryani: 3.5 star. It was good. But nothing special.

Szechwan chicken fried rice: 2 star. I have tried Indian chinese style fried rice at many Chinese restaurants in India and this is - Meh. I have experienced better. 

Chicken Noodles, chinese style: 2 star. Meh, I have experienced better. 

Bawarchi seems to be a franchise. I have been to Bawarchi in Plano, TX. It was amazing, deserving 5 stars (I reviewed it here on Yelp). At that location, both Indian and Chinese dishes were amazing. With that positive expectation, I drove two hours to dine here. It was quite disappointing. Fortunately, they did not have buffets. One cannot go for a $12 buffet and expect gourmet food. I avoid Buffet places. Bawarchi has extensive menu and it is likely that they have excellent apetizers. 

But because of the entrees, this deserves two stars but counting its excellent appetizer and service, I thought I would change that to 3 stars. 

PS: Bombay chopstix, which is close by also is an Indian chinese restaurant and has excellent apetizers. The entrees at Bombay chopstix and at Bawarchi were both about 2 to 3 stars.. Lollipop chicken at Bombay Chopstix is simply amazing.. a Must try!"

1. Waiters don&#39;t smile or explain the menu or even care that you are there.
2. Guy who is taking the phone order has zero phone etiquette.

When I questioned about the service the supervisor at the time ( 06/05/2016 - 2:40 PM ) did not care. No sense of empathy or ever care to hear what I got to say. All I got was do not come to this restaurant again.

Get past the fact the most of the items on the menu are not available, and most of the lunch selections are written in pencil on the side of a paper which clearly came from a fax machine,

Accept that there are some flies going around the restaurant because they left the back door open

Also get over the fact they may have forget a dish that you ordered.....

Once you accept all of that....if you can....The food is freaking amazing!!!!  We had the vegetarian Biryani, Paneer Tikka, garlic naan, poori, and alu curry and were blown away by ALL of the flavors.  Everything was authentic and had such an excellent combination of flavors we all stopped complaining and could not stop eating.  

Since it was lunch we opted for the Paneer Tikka Platter, which was the only vegetarian combo that was available, and it came with rice, rasam, dal, sweet, and ritha.  Everything was sooooooo good. Medium spice was perfect, since we had the kids with us.  The food was brought out in a timely fashion.  

If you like authentic south indian food with the masala and spice this is by far one of the best places in the Schaumburg area.  They have only been open for about 10days, so I am sure once they get their act together this place is going to be awesome.  

My only suggestion would be that the biryani should come with more riatha or yogurt on the side.  The quantity given in a single order of biryani is enough for two people, but they only give about 3 spoons of yogurt on the side, which not really enough.

If you are craving some good old fashion South Indian Hyderabad food, this is going to be the new goto place.  I look forward to trying the other dishes on the menu that were not available, including dosa, chili idly, and some of the other south indian specialties.  I am also hoping that the servers become more familiar with the menu and are able to communicate the specials better.  We are definitely looking forward to coming back."

Reached the place at 10.18pm on a Saturday evening, and were denied a table saying the restaurant is closed. The open signs were on and people were in there eating. 
The waiter guy says sorry but we will only give takeaway now. Another one says, actually no it&#39;s closed but allright one last order for you will can take! 
Obviously disappointed and no choice left 5 of us decided to take away food. While waiting I generally asked one of the rude waiters why have they printed the timing at 11.00pm and he says &#34;yes I know, but the management tells us to close by 10.30pm&#34;. So again I asked we were here well before 10.30pm right? And he says &#34;so? We staff have to go home too right?&#34;! 
He did argue with me for about 10 mins and also said he would take my complaint to the management and walked away rudely!

Didn&#39;t really like the tandoori chicken or the Indo Chinese fare the few times I tried them. Tandoori chicken isn&#39;t really well marinated and the Indo Chinese dishes were quite tasteless. Better served sticking to the curries, biryani and the south Indian fare. If you are looking for ambiance this really isn&#39;t the place but it&#39;s clean and the service is good.

Overall, I am upgrading it to 3.5 stars. I have sampled additional entrees over time. The food taste continues to amaze me but following are my issues:

1) As others have pointed out, the quantity is too less. The least I have seen by an Indian restaurant. The size of their carry-out containers have been getting smaller and smaller from week to week orders. They don&#39;t fill out the containers well. Just under 80%. 

2) The containers are not microwavable even though they looked like it. It burnt a hole within a minute and half into microwaving. 

3) I re-ordered something I had liked earlier and noticed that it turned out to be a completely different tasting dish. Consistency issues with recipes. 

4) They did mess up my order one-time. 
 
I can live with the last issue sometimes as it is an easy fix but they need to work on points 1-3."

mcdonalds-elgin-7,T J.,XzMF8qQRHlNwhpVJlt_S5Q,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,3,zU6GD526NHrl3MrsQWGhmw,2.0,2014-06-05,"This McDonald&#39;s is having their grand reopening after a complete remodel, so I thought I would have lunch there.  I have dined here many times, but this was my first time post remodel. The parking lot had very few spaces available, but when I got inside, I noticed that there were many employees working, but probably only about 8 customers. I guess the employees take up most of the parking spaces.  The parking has always been bad at this location, because the line for the drive through blocks many of the parking spots, and people will not let you out when you are trying to back out of your spot.  I would have hoped they could have figured out a way to fix this in the remodel, but the parking lot did not look like it had been changed.

The first thing I noticed when entering the restaurant was that both of the glass doors were filthy, with fingerprints everywhere.  At no time during the 45 minutes I was in the restaurant did anyone clean the doors or the glass, and at one time they had 2 people cleaning in the lobby. Major disappointment.

The service was fast. They have implemented a new system with a digital display above the cash registers where you are supposed to look for when your order is ready to pick up.  I guess service is getting less personal all the time.

I went over to fill up my drink cup at the self service beverage station. I noticed a female worker opening up the napkin dispenser and placing a few napkins into it.  This immediately drew my attention because the napkin dispenser was about 90% full so she was not restocking it.  I figured out what she was doing was if a customer left any napkins on their table, after they left, she was picking them up, and going and putting them back in the napkin dispenser to the right of the self service drink station. This was a major disappointment, so much so that after I saw it happen again, I felt compelled to speak to the manager to bring this to her attention. This is just plan unsanitary and I&#39;m sure a violation of health code regulations.

The design of the new dining area is really poor.  I was hoping that they would add significantly more seating in the remodel.  Instead they chose weird design over function, so fewer tables take up more space.  They cut off probably 20 or 30 feet of the old playplace and switched it over to dining space.  However, that new space was utilized poorly with some tables with high stools and others with low circular padded seats with no backs similar to an ottoman.  It felt really weird sitting on this ottoman like thing. The other choice was a hard looking preformed plastic chair that looked like something you would see for sale at a discount department department store, with no comfort.

My food quality was what I would have expected for McDonalds.  The hamburger was warm, but dry (which is a byproduct of the made for you cooking system where all the hamburger patties are cooked in advance and put into warming drawers). The fries were hot and cooked perfectly.

Something weird happened with my quarter pounder with cheese box.  The ink from the bottom of the box came off all over the table.  I&#39;m not sure if this is a defect with the box, or a property of the new table making the ink come off.  Regardless, there was quite a bit of black ink on the table when I finished my sandwich.  Weird.

There is still a playplace at this location, but it has been significantly downsized from what was in the old store.  Since I did not have any kids with me, I can&#39;t give you a review of that.

So all in all, I would say the food was ok, the service was good, but the odd things happening with the napkins in the lobby and the filthy doors were a big detractor."

I gave them another chance since I love their breakfasts.  At 10:25 some guy flipped over the breakfast sign and said lunch is being served, it was not 10:30!

It&#39;s pretty nondescript from the outside, which is a big part of why I&#39;d never gone before, but after that awesome experience that I had today, I will surely be back.

Most importantly, I came alone with my two very young sons (2 and 19 months), and they could not have been more gracious and accommodating. Our waitress particularly went out of her way to make the meal as enjoyable as possible. The kids weren&#39;t misbehaving, just squirrely and wanting to grab most everything on the table. Even when a muffin ended up on the floor and some orange juice was spilled, she happily came to our table and helped. The icing on the cake was when one of them dropped his sippy cup on the floor and she picked it up for us and rinsed it off for him. 

On top of all of that, the food was great. Very generous (and inexpensive) serving sizes, and it comes out hot and quickly. I highly, highly recommend this place."

The crepes were the worst I have ever had in my life.  Luckily my 4 year old is not picky and he ate them.  They were absolutely DISGUSTING.

I usually stick to the breakfast side of the menu, and my favorites are the omelettes and pancakes. The omelettes are pretty big (4 eggs) and baked which makes them a little different. I most recently got the meat lovers omelette with feta, hash browns, and pancakes, which was super filling and a real value. The pancakes are the best and I wouldn&#39;t go here without getting them. If you order a meal and you have the option of toast or pancakes, get the pancakes every time. I haven&#39;t had them, but the crepes always look great. Outside of breakfast foods, I know the fries are pretty good (batter-dipped, so lots of crunch).

They can certainly get busy on the weekends, but get there early and you&#39;re fine. Or, just go around noon when it settles down a bit.

I had been to several diners while traveling recently, so now I appreciate how much better the service is here. The last few times we&#39;ve had Ashley as our server, and she&#39;s been the best. Super attentive and accommodating, quick with the food, and she never stopped. She was taking care of several tables alone and doing well by everyone, then cleaning and organizing stuff by the counters, then back to refilling drinks, etc. Very efficient.

I had a reuben which was very nice (I like lots of kraut) but the fries were the star of the plate!  It was almost as if  they they had a light coating of batter - crispy flaky on the outside and tender and creamy on the inside.  Seriously, some of the best fries I&#39;ve had in awhile.  

Everything was yummers!"

I ordered the Bavarian Reuben sandwich and it was terrible.  The corned beef looked like it had been reheated about 5 times.  It was dry, tough and very fatty.  My aunt ordered the same sandwich and she got 1 slice of corned beef on each half.  We called the waitress over, who was SO nice and trying to fix the situation.  She said she would bring us some fresh corned beef on a plate.  She walked back to our table and asked my aunt for her plate to show the cook cause he didn&#39;t believe her!  She was so apologetic and felt terrible for us.  I believe the owner came over and asked how everything was.  My aunt said &#34;the corned beef is quite tough and dry.&#34;  He pretended like he didn&#39;t hear us and walked away.  I wish I had gotten the name of our waitress, cause she was wonderful, but everything else was not good."

The servers are very friendly and work very hard to provide a good experience for diners, and they succeed. The atmosphere is very nice for a Sunday morning breakfast out. And the food is very good, too.

I had one quibble, but for me it is an important one. The hash browns were bitter. They were not burned, so it&#39;s probably not from overcooking, but they were bitter. I love hash browns - they are the part of breakfast I look forward to the most. The eggs I had were good, the bacon very good, the orange juice outstanding, the muffins delicious and a nice extra touch. But the hash browns, the main part of the meal, were just off.

I&#39;ll probably go back, but bitter hash browns a second time would probably be the last time for me. But they have a lot of other things going for them, and other people may love the hash browns. Everyone I saw seemed to be enjoying their meals. And when you see such nice people working at a place, you want the place to do well. Hopefully I just caught them on a bad day for hash browns, because they seem to do so well with everything else."

Nothing bad, but nothing outstanding. It was just okay. LOL no sign of the complimentary OJ and blueberry muffins someone mentioned below though!

  I had the baked sausage and cheese omelette. It was good, not an over abundance of cheese, which i liked. My husband had ham off the bone and two eggs over medium. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the ham a bit dry.  But fine. His only complaint was he said the coffee was horrid, so he ordered a diet coke. And the pancakes are very thick.

A little bit of humor for me. We used to go to a restaurant on Randall that had the most divine homemade corned beef hash on the planet. After several months, they switched to canned hash, miserable. When we asked our server why, she told us it was because so many people complained about the fresh hash and requested the canned variety. So today, I asked the server if the hash was fresh. And she said it used to be, but they they switched to canned because so many people complained about the fresh hash and requested the canned variety. It was the same server from the restaurant on Randall!!

All in all, we will probably return."

Turkey club - So dry it literally hurt to swallow.
Cream of chicken rice soup - Had to load up the pepper and salt to make it edible. SO bland 
Basket of rolls and crackers - The crackers were expired and the rolls had to be 2 days old. ROCK HARD
Rueben - The person who ordered it said &#34;it&#39;s really not good. I&#39;ve had better in run down bars&#34;
Coleslaw - Not fresh and I have to wonder if the small bit I ate will cause illness....
When the server came to clear the table and saw that none of us barely ate our food she asked if we needed boxes. We all said no, she took our plates and dropped the check. Never asked if something was wrong....

The place is tiny and can be cramped - There are a couple tables where the chair from one table and another back into each other and I&#39;ve seen people awkwardly not be able to get in or out of their table because their chair is pushing on someone behind them. Could be uncomfortable. Note to self: Always aim for a booth.

But the food here comes quick and is top-notch. I personally prefer their skillets. They&#39;re huge with perfectly crisp hashbrowns and are all around delicious. Get the white toast - it&#39;s thick-cut sourdough. I call it crack toast. YUM!"

The house hot sauce really brought the whole meal together. I would definitely go back.

Had the burger which I think is a pretty good way to judge the food  because it is such a staple.The burger was cooked just right and all the fixins were good too. The service was also good and the food came out quickly. Nice little place just off main street that I would recommend checking out.

Meat
Shrimp - 5
Ribs - 4 (too much sauce but fall of the bone!)
Brisket - 4
Pork - 4
Wings - 4
Ham - 3
Coleslaw - 5

Sides
Potato Salad - 3

I split the jumbo beer battered shrimp with my mom -- also shared a baked potato, bread roll, and then I took the spicy beans, and she took the coleslaw. 

First off, the shrimp are a front runner for the best shrimp I&#39;ve ever eaten. The batter was golden, delicious, and not overpowering; and the shrimp itself was so flavorful and definitely jumbo. I LOVE their house made spicy beans. There&#39;s actually bits of jalapeños and maybe a tiny bit of pork in it (don&#39;t quote me on the pork though). All I know is they&#39;re the only beans on this earth that I enjoy. Baked potatoes are always hot and fresh; can&#39;t comment on the slaw because I don&#39;t eat it.

Overall, a truly great place with great food. Can get a touch pricey depending on what you order and if you get beer or not. I believe it was around $32 for my parents and I (keep in mind that I split a dish with my mom). You must eat here!"

My wife is actually the rib fan in our house, so when she suggested we give this place a try, I was more than happy to oblige her. I&#39;m thankful that I did too, because this place has great ribs!

We&#39;ve had ribs in a few other local spots, but these are the best. The sauces were on point, especially the hot sauce and the spicy sauce (actually I had a hard time telling them apart, because I just kept alternating between).

The ribs were fall-off-the-bone, which some rib connoisseurs will scoff at, but the meat was still in that sweet spot between firm and fall-apart-in-your-fingers.

The service was friendly and patient, as the huge menu gave us a lot of options. The kids split some of the chicken, which was tender and moist. And lastly the curly fries were seasoned to perfection and a must have side item!

I like the super casual atmosphere and the saloon inspired ambience. You place your order and seat yourself, and you&#39;re able to help yourself to beverages and sauces.

It&#39;s a small place with a local feel. It&#39;s exactly how I imagined a BBQ place should be - Texas decor, murals of the desert on the wall, country music in the background. 

They have a pretty big menu. They don&#39;t have any beers on draft, only bottled. You order and pay up front, and then they bring out your food and check up on you throughout your visit. Everyone who works there is very nice. 

I have to say, I wasn&#39;t really impressed with their food, especially for the prices. For what it is, I think it is overpriced, I had the brisket sandwich and I didn&#39;t think it had good flavor, and the texture was almost mealy. It wasn&#39;t thick chunks of meat, maybe too shredded? The salad bar really isn&#39;t much, we didn&#39;t even partake in that. What&#39;s nice is they don&#39;t put too much sauce on the meat, but they have 3 different sauces to choose from so you can add more. The steak fries and coleslaw were very good.

Needless to say, it is a unique place. It&#39;s a nice addition to Algonquin."

Without a doubt, this is the worst barbecue I&#39;ve ever had. Their brisket is--I&#39;m not kidding--like shaved Italian beef (the driest one you&#39;ve ever had) covered in barbecue sauce, and the rib tips... that&#39;s a $13.99 plate of disappointment.

The sauce is good, though. And the people are very nice. It pains me to give this place one star, but, truth be told, I&#39;ll never go back."

The Turkey was the exact consistency of shaved turkey you would pick up at a grocery store.  Very disappointing, though I knew it would be when my food came out right after I ordered it.  

My suggesting, condense your menu and do a few things well instead of a lot of things horribly.  Real BBQ should be slow cooked and served at the right time.  You should take &#34;Texan&#34; from your name before someone from Texas comes around and gives you a piece of their mind."

The food was more than filling even for my always hungry husband.  Our 9 year-old had more than enough with a kid&#39;s meal, while the 11 year-old raved about his fall-off the bone ribs.

I also enjoyed the stew with an array of different meats my boyfriend got. Did not taste uncomfortably heavy. We had their brisket.. shredded pork.. and pork sausage. It gives you the BBQ on the side when get it go which I LOVE! their bbq sauce is pretty good more vinegary which is what I prefer.

I ordered the two meat dinner. My choices were the baby back ribs and chicken. The dinner came with beans, coleslaw and some tastes potatoes with peppers and onions. The chicken was over cooked and extremely dry and saturated with BBQ sauce. The baby back ribs were extremely tender would have been really great if they weren&#39;t  saturated with BBQ sauce. I would have like to taste the meat. If you decide to visit, get the sauce on the side.

The Service was good and accommodated for the mistakes with the order by offering free desert which were powered donut balls chocolate and caramel sauces. The donuts were severely undercooked (inedible).

Based on this visit I would not recommend eating here. However our waitress was very apologetic and seem to really care about our experience."

I was initially set up to hate them because they were really hesitant to come deliver despite being just a 5 minute drive from the brewery and despite them being in the delivery binder at the brewery and despite Yelp saying they deliver.

I have to say though that once our food arrived, we both completely changed our tune. I ordered the BBQ Ham Sandwich for $6.99 and was shocked when it came because it was just so thick! Their menu is huge so it was hard to pin myself down to just one thing to order but I was really happy with the sandwich. The meat was juicy as all get out, delicious BBQ sauce and even the bun was quite good - apparently they make them in house.

You can also order a jalapeno cornbread with it and the two make a complete meal. If you have not had Texas style chili it is a treat (to me). I was first introduced at the Texas Chili Parlor in Austin; this place is the closest I have had to their chili since leaving Austin. I have also tried burgers at this location but the chili is enough to make a visit. They also specialize in Texas BBQ - that is brisket not pork as their best meal.

The decor is like an Old West Saloon and it is fun for kids. For children you will have a challenge on the menu. They know how to make their chili spicy so it is great for an adult but my son is not a big fan of their food.

Great place for a quick stop and a hearty bowl of chili."

The last time we dined here was some time ago however the consistency and food quality remains outstanding as with our first visit. 

 Upon entering, you find yourself in what appears to be a converted two story house which now makes for a homely dining experience. You place your order at the counter and it is brought to you at your table. Just a note, they have three different types of BBQ sauce and you can order you meat dry to try them all! The menu also offers kids entree and other items if BBQ is not to your liking.

  Our baby backs where fell off the bone retaining the moisture and flavor of the meat. This was complimented by our sides of coleslaw and baked potatoes. The coleslaw was not too runny nor creamy and with just enough sweetness as to not overpower the other ingredients.

It&#39;s fairly standard barbecue fare (for the midwest) offering a full menu, including pork and beef ribs, turkey, sausage, chicken, brisket and additional, non-smoked fare like burgers, chicken fried steak and the like.  Standard sides are beans, slaw, and a choice of potato.  Food is available on plates, with one, two, or three meats, or as sandwiches.

Meats are cooked in house on a hickory fire.

Order and pay for your food at the counter when you walk in, have a seat and your meals will be brought to you.

The have a &#39;sauce bar&#39;, where you can fill ramekins of &#34;mild,&#34; &#34;hot,&#34; or &#34;spicy&#34; sauce, but they all tasted exactly the same to me.   We had the ribs/chicken combo, the chicken fried steak, and an order of rings.

The chicken fried steak was  a large serving, two pieces, with gravy and biscuits and the aforementioned sides.   The menu had stated each entree came with Texas toast and pickles, but no such luck today. Biscuits were the order of the day, instead.   If you&#39;re a regular reader of my posts, you know how much I go for Texas toast!

Was it great?  Not really?  Worth a drive?  Not really.  A good value?  Not really.   It&#39;s one of those times where as cliched as it sounds, &#34;it was what it was.&#34;  But to last over 30 years, he must be doing something right.  The Texan BBQ also caters"

The pulled pork, though, that is where they got this southern boys attention. It is phenomenal! It has the luscious smoked flavor from a long slow cook and the meat is still perfectly moist so that you don&#39;t have to smother it in their BBQ sauce or wash each bite down with a gallon of tea.  The sauce is also pretty outstanding. It is rich and &#34;tomatoey&#34; and very smooth without a huge brown sugar or vinegar bite to it.

I&#39;ve lived in the Algonquin area for 25 years, and have always loved Texan BBQ. Hands down, one of my favorite BBQ sauces in the area!!! You can buy it by the bottle as well, which I recommend for home use. I found out, too, that the bottles tend to be spicier / hotter than the sauce in the restaurant, which they make on site!

This visit was special, as I now live in Des Plaines, quite a drive, and was looking forward to some good BBQ to take with me. The order process is basic - stand and order, then wait for your food (or sit down if you&#39;re dining in), and it can get crowded in there - though at 4:30 this day, it was fun to chat with others waiting and the order taker. Very friendly place!

I ordered the Hickory Hog, which is 1/2 pound of BBQ Pork served open faced on a bun with two sides. I got the Cole Slaw and Potato Salad. The pork had some sauce in with it, but the rest on the side since my order was carry out. Serving size seemed OK, probably the 1/2 pound shown, but seemed less exciting than in the past because it wasn&#39;t slathered with it like when you dine in. ;-) The cole slaw and potato salad were excellent, though the serving size was tiny! Especially the potato salad, with nice, large chunks of potato and other goodies, crammed into a tiny condiment sized cup. Flavor - excellent. Size - embarrassing.

They offer a fun, if limited selection of fountain drinks, with Green River and Sprecher&#39;s Root Beer, along with a couple other Coke products. I didn&#39;t try them, but the bin of beer on ice is pretty good, too.

Though they are the same owners, and the flavors are still good, it seems less than I remember from years past. I&#39;d recommend the pork, brisket or ribs, as other items are closer to &#39;regular&#39; from past experience. The fries can be excellent, and beans very good, so recommend them for sides. The place has character, and is moderately clean considering the messiness of the food. Up the sizes of the sides (they can&#39;t cost that much) and you&#39;ll probably have a lot more happy customers."

 with the addition of thinly sliced prime rib, very good. The ribs were in no way memorable, average, but they will satisfy the rib craving. The pulled pork, pretty much the same as the ribs. The potato salad and cole slaw were both very good. 
The place did seem to have a nice redneck bar feel to it. There is both on street parking and a small lot. I know better rib places but in this area, not so much. They will scratch your BBQ itch here. I would rate this place 3 and a half stars could I, but I can&#39;t, and I dropped a little more than I felt I should, so there you have it."

You should be able to grab a hunk of BBQ meat and eat it without sauce and it be amazing. That&#39;s the sign of someone who knows how to smoke meat. This place doesn&#39;t know that.

I ordered the tacos with chopped pork and they were almost inedible. I&#39;ve never had BBQ pork that was this dry. Once I added the sauce it made it at least to where I wouldn&#39;t throw it in the trash and completely waste my money. My wife had the turkey sandwich that came with way to much sauce on it. My guess is they know the sauce is good and the meat isn&#39;t so they serve it this way.

I only gave this 1 star because the sauce is that good.

I&#39;d be happy to take them on with my Big Green Egg...and I wouldn&#39;t need sauce to make my smoked pork or smoked brisket amazing.

I can say 100% we will never go back."

This another one of those places that looks and feels like a southern BBQ spot.  You order when you walk in and then find your own seat.  But that&#39;s where the similarity ends.  The meat tastes and looked like someone went to a grocery store deli counter and asked them to shave a bunch of the rectangular my shaped, reformed blocks of animal meat products.  The meat does not feel, look, or taste like it is &#34;off the bone&#34;.   The &#34;rolls&#34; are just hamburger buns, nothing special.  They do have curly fries! So that&#39;s a plus.  All said and done, it&#39;s overpriced, the meat was edible, but we will not be back.  I can&#39;t understand how this place is so busy, except that maybe there&#39;s a bunch of people who have settled for this quality or just like lunch meat with BBQ sauce?"

After a long absence, I was able to stop in for dinner last week, and was VERY glad I did. 

For folks who can&#39;t decide between the many delicious selections on their menu, my suggestion is to try the 3-meat combo dinner. Beef, pork &amp; chicken are all staples of any BBQ lover&#39;s diet, so the generous helpings on this combo platter, slathered in homemade BBQ sauce (mild, spicy or HOT) will surely represent the high standards that have kept customers coming back for well over 3 decades now.

As far as side dishes are concerned, the beans &amp; the coleslaw are both made fresh on the premises, and the curly fries are excellent as well. There&#39;s also a modest salad bar available for those who are so inclined to have some raw veggies with their meal. 

A full-service bar is offered for folks who enjoy a libation to go with their lunch or dinner, as well as freshly brewed iced tea, but my personal beverage favorite is the venerable Green River soda, which is on tap, alongside all the &#34;usual suspects&#34; of cola, root beer, etc.

The Texan is west of the beautiful Fox River, located just north of Algonquin Rd. on the east side of rt. 31, and the free parking lot is behind the building. 

Take-out is available, but the ambiance inside is cozy &amp; welcoming, so spend a little time to enjoy your meal, and you&#39;re sure to return often."

Nothin&#39; fancy.  Friendly staff.  Bottles of beer in a big wash basin on ice by the register.

Why 2 Stars? 3 reasons (for which some may think I&#39;m a cheap, gluttonous, jerk but I can assure you that is not the case):

1. The price.  If I&#39;m paying $7 - $8 for a sandwich I would hope it comes with at least fries or coleslaw as a side.  Nope.  Sides are all a la carte unless you order a dinner plate.  The sandwiches we had were all very good though - though nothing you couldn&#39;t easily eat in one sitting.  As a comparison I normally only eat half of a big burger ordered at other restaurants such as The Ram or Elgin Public House.  Here I can eat the whole pulled pork sandwich just fine.

2. Okay, so we&#39;ve established you will have to order your side(s) separately if you don&#39;t order a dinner plate.  Depending on what kind of side you get it will be hit or miss as far as how much of the side item you get.  Fries?  Probably one of the few sides I&#39;ve seen where I feel they give you a decent amount.  Baked beans?  Small cup.  Ditto on the coleslaw.  Fried okra?  A handful and you paid over $3 for &#39;em.

3. I would not take a whole lot of issue with #1 or #2 above since they are just a small local restaurant and would like to make some sort of profit.  However, it&#39;s also the type of place you order at the counter, then go sit down &amp; they bring you the food - no table service.  You want more sauce?  Go up to the condiment station and get some.  You want a refill on your beverage?  Same.  I would hope for the price I am paying they would at least have table service and I will gladly, generously tip our server.  

I don&#39;t mind eating at places without table service but establishments like that I frequent have either lower prices, much larger portions or come with a side.  We only go to the Texan when our friends who live in the area want to dine here."

This place earned my pick for best BBQ in the Midwest when. I started coming here a couple of years ago.  I pretty much always ordered the pulled pork or brisket, which made it my favorite in the area. Their sauces are fantastic,love the baked beans, and the potato salad is pretty good too.

Well now let me tell you...after coming here for years I finally tried their ribs.  And oh...my...god are they good.  Their ribs are honest to god the best ribs I have ever had anywhere...and yes, I&#39;m even including my home state of Texas in that!

So bottom line is, when I go back to Texas every year I find myself judging the BBQ down south against The Texan.  And usually the southern joints just don&#39;t quite do it as well as Texan does."

But the just so-so meal may not bring us back. Brisket was ok, cut thinner than I&#39;m used to. Pulled pork was juicy. But a lack of smoke flavor loses points with me. And this is the first BBQ joint that I&#39;ve been to that serves its meat with sauce already on it. Too presumptuous for me. Sides are good but nothing amazing. Overall, if you can&#39;t get to Texas for real BBQ, this is no substitute. But it&#39;ll do."

It was worth a visit out in Algonquin, though. And should I add it was a rainy night too? Well, 4 of us made it there and we had the back of the place much to ourselves. Texan is a divey looking palce inside. There is this saloon feel to the whole joint, right down to the dilapidated pickup truck I parked across from.

Inside, there&#39;s a foyer area with an order counter. You place your order right there and then have a seat. I wanted to try a multitude of things, so I went with a Meat Lover&#39;s Platter along with a small sample side of their chili.

In maybe 10-15 minutes, I had a small bowl of chili and a formidable array of pulled pork, beef brisket, ribs, sausage and sliced turkey breast in front of me. Thick steak fries adorned the plate too. I probably had 3 meals&#39; worth right there.

I dug in, doing my best to sample each. First the chili. It&#39;s very meaty, more like a pulled beef chili with generous clusters of shredded meat - not finely ground taco meat or something wiempy from your typical diner. From the meat assortment, my favorite was probably the beef brisket. Sausage was great too and the ribs were tender. Sliced turkey - not so much. It looked like deli meat turkey slathered in BBQ sauce, somewhat out of place with the other meats proudly on display beside it.

Service was pretty good. You can fill your own drink at a fountain dispenser, which makes it convenient. 

There is a Western theme throughout the place. We sat across from a full-sized horse saddle mounted on a ledge opposite our table. There&#39;s also a mural of a desert and cactus plants in an adjacent room.

In all, a good dining experience and plenty of leftovers despite being too full for dessert. Good prices too. And if I really want to go all out the next time that I&#39;m here, I will order the beef ribs like Ericka A, did. The slab covered the entire plate and hung over both sides. There were enough ribs to feed a family of hyenas!"

I&#39;ve lived in the area for 11 years which is when I first tried this place. Then, I experienced cold, bland overpriced food, BBQ beef to be exact. Well 11 years later I tried again tonight with my kids (out of connivence) and nothing changed. Since I just ate there I&#39;ll elaborate.

I ordered a BBQ beef with bacon, cheddar, grilled onions, tomato and a side of hush puppies.

The beef was very, very dry and tasteless. The bacon was cold and hard without any flavor for the exception of a medicine taste. The cheese was this obviously bagged shredded cheddar which they hardly put any on and it wasn&#39;t even melted, just thrown, dry on and falling to sides. The bread was dry, old and just broke apart. I needed their lousy Open Pit textured sauce to give some taste. The hush puppies were crisp like and over cooked. You would thing for being a BBQ place their meats would be right on.

Their preorder service is a horrid setup with one slow register. If you want a second drink you have to walk up and wait in line and it was semi-busy at 7pm on a Friday night when it should be packed. My kids had kid meals, one being ribs which looked really fatty. The other had a hotdog which probably was okay but they&#39;re hard to screw up.

Most definitely better off going to Texas Road House right down from there on 31. I&#39;m all for supporting independent businesses but Texan BBQ is not worth it. Definitely will not be going back soon nor in another 11 years."

Actually, I was trying to theme the day. Last year I made heart shaped pancakes for our Valentine&#39;s Day dinner... this year, I didn&#39;t want to cook, but I wanted something red... BBQ sauce is red! Problem solved.

I ordered the turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes. I love the mashed potatoes at The Texan... so does my 5 year old daughter. She and I ended up trading - my mashed potatoes for her curly fries.

My son ordered the hot dog meal while my daughters ordered the mac n cheese meal. All kids meals come with a side, a drink and beans. And, kids eat free on Monday&#39;s and Tuesday&#39;s (with a paid adult meal).

The turkey sandwich was wonderful... so were the curly fries. All the kids housed their food and they all enjoyed it.

The meat is very tender and is it served with their house/original BBQ sauce. Spicy BBQ is also available for you to satisfy your taste buds. All dinners include a choice of potato (baked, seasoned curly fries, steak fries, or potato salad). There&#39;s more! You also get mayonnaise based coleslaw, Texas toast, and sweet pickles.

I have never been to Texas but I have friends who will vouch that this place is pretty great for not being in Texas, that has to go for something?

Things I&#39;ve tried and I would recommend : Beef Ribs, they are huge and have so much meat and so much flavor.  Smoked Sausage ...full of flavor, you can&#39;t go wrong, I promise.  The Cornbread Muffin - I&#39;m not a fan of cornbread but I like this cornbread and it&#39;s HUGE, compliments BBQ perfectly.  Beef Brisket is ok, it tends to get cold fast though, I hate that.

I&#39;ve tried both pork and beef ribs and they are too fatty and saucy for my liking, definitely not a smoked, dry-rub style that appeals to me.  Some of the sides are pretty good (e.g. BBQ beans) but others are pretty bland."

However, whenever the subject of BBQ come up, the experience my husband and I had here always gets brought back up.  Maybe things have changed for the better since we went.  But,  I can only speak for our one and only attempt.  We went to this place excited at the possibility of having a good BBQ place close  by.  Unfortunately, our excitement proved to be short lived.  The experience we had was very disappointing.  
We did take-out of a few items excited to see which one(s) would emerge as the favorites.  
Ribs-No taste.  Tough and mushy at the same time???
Pulled pork-only a hint of smokiness.  Otherwise, no taste and stringy.
Brisket-Did not like the meat cut up.  Was grainy.
Brunswick stew-Absolutely awful.  The visual aesthetic was not appealing.  It was an unappetizing greyish color with all the chunks and bits...you get what I mean.  The smell was not far behind.  It did not smell fresh/new.  It smelled like it was starting to get old; having a little of that decaying meat smell.  This was only item I could not bring myself to actually try.  The look and smell had me on system shut down.  
Fries-generic fries that could be found in any school cafeteria.  Could take or leave them.
We really wanted to like this place.  But, it left us very underwhelmed.  Looking at the other reviews, many seem to enjoy it.  Maybe we caught an off moment.  This establishment will likely continue on as it has.  But, we will not be making another attempt."

If you dine in, you order, pay, and find a table. They will bring out your Q in a couple minutes and it&#39;s hot. Some Q joints give you the food slightly above room temperature. It&#39;s very rustic inside. After you find a table to your liking go get some Q sauce to bring back to the table, they have three kinds of their fantastic sauces.

The food is likely the best Texan BBQ style food you&#39;re gonna get anywhere in the country outside of Texas.  I&#39;m sure most Texans will suggest theirs is better, but I doubt it.  I&#39;ve eaten many of BBQ in Texas and this place is right up there.

The atmosphere is fun and has a great Texan flare.  you have a great smoke smell in the air along with a nice wood from the walls and floor.

Their portion size has shrunk in the last 5 years.  This bothers me and has stopped my from ordering lunch there or bringing guests.

I dislike their ordering procedure.  It&#39;s very bizzare.  You stand in line like the pigs and cows they serve to place your order.  You pay and go and sit.  A waitress brings your meal at which time you&#39;re halve done your beverage.  Since the meal is paid already, they miss out on additional beverage sales, but more than that, they miss out on the customer and embark in a large opportunity cost, the customer is under served and their margins are likely hurt.  Anyone I&#39;ve spoke to, and I live in Algonquin, dislikes this process.  It is really bizzare to me that the management still opts for this poor level of service.  I have never brought a client or guest to this establishment.

Bottom line these guys have a very good product, despite smaller sizes for the same price.  I just ask for more smoked sausage on my sandwich to make a real sandwich and it&#39;s smokin good!"

I had the 1/2 chicken, and it was awful.  It was GREASY and undercooked, still pink in the middle.  It wasn&#39;t worth it to me to send it back, as the chicken was awful.

The place and the food have never changed.  As others have described, the exterior of the facility is a bit dumpy, but don&#39;t let that scare you.  The moment you open your car door, you smell the meat smoking in the barn out back.  

I spend a great deal of time in Texas, so my opinion may be biased.  Texans know BBQ.  The BBQ at The Texan, while technically competent, would not make the grade at all when compared to real Texas BBQ.  The meat tends to be dry which is then compensated for by thinly slicing the meat and slathering it in their house BBQ sauce.  The product you end up with is reasonably tasty.  In Texas, the meat is usually sliced thicker which gives you a meatier mouthful.  

The other issue I have with the Texan is portion size.  At a Texas BBQ place, you usually get substantial portions that are usually overwhelming.  At The Texan, not so much.  In fact, I&#39;ve noticed portion size decrease over the years so much so that I find myself ordering larger, more expensive entrees to compensate.  

The house BBQ sauce is a bit bland.  Out in the foyer area, they offer three other BBQ sauces.  The &#34;Hot&#34; variety is pretty tasty and tangy, with just the right amount of heat to keep it interesting.  

All in all, not a bad place and I will keep going back from time to time.  I do wish they would up their game a little bit by improving their cooking process to render moister cuts of meat and also increase their average portion size.  If they followed both of those suggestions, I would easily give them a grade of 4-stars.  The 5th star I reserve for the real Texas BBQ joints."

The bad: the burgers we ordered were not hot - they were barely warm (the manager redid them for us - they were slightly better). The Coca-Cola dispensed by their fountain tasted terrible - too watered down, not enough syrup.  I recall this being the case on prior visits - I think they&#39;re trying to be cheap and getting the most out of their bag-in-box syrup supply.

Speaking of cheap...  When placing our order, my wife had asked for a cup for water and didn&#39;t receive one - once we received our meal, she asked for a cup again and was told it would cost 43 cents!  (My wife said forget it, but I think the cashier, seeing my wife&#39;s disappointment, felt bad about the cost and gave her the cup anyway).  Talk about nickel and diming!  My wife thinks water should be free for those purchasing a full meal - she believes the restaurant may charge for the water cup to discourage loiterers.

I am a cheap guy, if I buy lunch from somewhere to-go , I&#39;ll eat it rather than throw it out and &#39;waste&#39; the money.  

I ordered lunch from here today, brought it back to my office to eat, took three bites of the Sesame Chicken, got two pieces of gristle that I could not chew through and gave up on that.

I said, well, I have a lot of fried rice, maybe that will be good?  Fail #2 - bland and flavor-less.  

OK, enough of that - on to the egg-roll the size of two anywhere else - maybe that will be good?  Nope, tasted &#39;off&#39; and I gave up after one bite.

Kung Pao Chicken:  my husband ordered this and while he  liked it, it was full of zucchini, baby corn and mushrooms which unfortunately he does not like.   Overall, it had a nice flavor and spice.

A family purchased the business from the older Chinese lady that ran the place.  Fortunately, the food is equally as good, for the most part. 

I have two minor complaints though -- First, when I order a spicy/hot dish, I expect it to be spicy/hot.  For some reason, I can never seem to get any dish spicy enough to my liking.  

Second, the Egg Drop Soup has &#34;changed&#34;.  It is still Egg Drop Soup, but the flavor is sort of blah.  Not nearly as good as when the older Chinese lady ran things.

Timely and friendly service. Meals are packaged in a very neat and organized manner compared to other places, really like that. Sauces, napkins, and forks are tied in a separate bag. Egg rolls get their own bag as well. I HATE how other places just throw everything in your tray! Um...yeah I don&#39;t appreciate having to dig my sauce packets and fork out of my fried rice, gross! Plus they are taking up space that should be for my food!

This place is nothing like that. They take that extra step instead of cutting those corners and it shows. They definitely take pride in how they run their business and they fill your tray. Those little things add up so I will round my 4.5 to a 5.  Happy customer here!"

Then I switched to HKC. HKC was very close in quality and taste and significantly less expensive. Then new owners came in and prices went up, portions became smaller, consistency and quality started to suffer. The last time I ordered cashew chicken. Guess what, no cashews, it came with peanuts. I looked the menu over and I didn&#39;t see any item that came with peanuts. I don&#39;t understand the thought process of &#34;oh well, peanuts will do&#34;. Why not just tell me they are out of cashews so I could choose something else. Instead they lost a frequent customer.

The silver lining is that I found a new place to try. New China Restaurant in Carpentersville on route 25. We dined in. The atmosphere was nice and clean. We received very friendly, timely service and hot tea to start our meal. The prices compare with Gilberts and HKC, but the portions are amazing. The combo meals are a great value. We all took home half of our meal. With the bill came complimentary almond cookies and fortune cookies. We were very satisfied and will be frequent guests."

I was told that hot mustard must be requested and is no longer automatically provided with an order of 2 egg rolls.  I always got a couple of sweet and sour sauces and a couple of hot mustards in the past.  The man I spoke with on the phone basically made me feel like I should have asked for it when we placed the order.  The entrees were not nearly as tasty as they were in the past.  In reading other reviews, I see that the ownership has changed.

It&#39;s not very imposing when you get there, in fact we never knew the restaurant was there. We live only a couple of miles from here and asked the server how long they&#39;d been in business. We learned they have been located there for six years. It&#39;s pretty easy to miss.

What set this apart from typical Mexican restaurants in the area was the prevalence of seafood on the menu. We started with an order of Guacamole. (Note, on the menu this is listed as &#34;market price&#34;.) There were three of us so we asked if the small or large would be good for us. He said the small was one avocado and the large was 1 1/2. We ordered the large and it was enormous. There had to be three or four Haas Avocados in it. But, it was outstanding. It had just the right balance of onion, garlic, jalapeno, lime, etc. Very, very fresh.

For dinner, my son and I each got &#34;PARRILLADA LEVANTA MUERTOS&#34;. This is sort of a fajita like dish with Shrimp, fish, calamari, oysters, red &amp; green and onions. It is all marinated in a spicy paste seasoning. It comes with rice and tortillas (choice of corn or wheat). This was absolutely great - delicious. When you order this, you can order it for one person through four people. It all comes on one plate.

The meal was enormous. In fact, I usually pride myself on finishing everything. This time, the food won. We finished all of the fish, but only about 1/2 of the tortillas and a little more than 1/2 of the guacamole.

One other thing, they offer a check in special on Yelp - buy one entree and get one for 1/2 price. This offer is also available on their website as a coupon. While they are not particularly expensive, every little bit helps."

Here goes:

** Open til 3am Tuesday through Sunday

** A darn good ceviche dish. For $8.50 you get a larger-than-cereal-bowl sized of all seafood in citrus zest topped with sliced and sliced avocado. It&#39;s served with Ritz crackers and Valentina brand extra hot sauce. 

** Camarones el Diablo was legit hot. My gums are still kind of tingly and that&#39;s how I like it. My The late is around $12 and you get 7 medium-large sized shrimp, rice, beans and tortillas. 

** Free chips and salsa.

** The vegetarian mix plate was just okay. Tostada was great, also included small, plain cheese quesadilla  and smallest burrito ever (pretty much 3/4 of an enchilada sized) that was just beans, rice... which the dish also had a side of. It was kind of beans, cheese and rice overload but with all the meat options here, I can&#39;t imagine that they have a huge call for veggies. 

** The service was pretty standard. Very neutral on the excitement level of having customers in the near-empty business, but there could have been a very slight language barrier. 

** I was expecting this place to be a counter order/take out type place from the outside, but it&#39;s actually a full service sit-down restaurant. 

** Inside is alarmingly barren of decorations. Just red walls and very basic chairs and standing tables. If I didn&#39;t know it was a Mexican restaurant, I&#39;d think it was a just a room used to store chairs and tables, although towards the ceiling you can see they have multiple strobe lights, speakers, projectors and screens and also an area in the corner that look like it might be able to house a dj - not sure though. Perhaps there&#39;s a party hour or something that I&#39;m not yet familiar with. 

** Horchata was pretty darn good... but when are they ever not might be the better question. 

** I really enjoyed the ceviche, but overall I wasn&#39;t &#39;wowed&#39; by anything else I had, probably in part to not eating meat (besides fish), which I think really makes or breaks most Mexican food experiences. If you aren&#39;t eating Mexican food with meat, you&#39;re probably eating something you could&#39;ve recreated at home. 

** They had one of the larger seafood menus I&#39;ve seen at a budget-friendly Mexican restaurant, and offered a variety of unique options. 

** Our bill was $35 (with a 50% off your second entree Yelp check-in deal) for two Horchatas, chips and salsa giant bowl of ceviche and two meals, of which we had leftovers.

** In the end, the lack of atmosphere took the dining experience down a notch, but I&#39;d go back and/or call in a carry out order if I were in the area. That ceviche would be a great item to bring to a party, especially since it&#39;s large enough to share with a family.**"

I live in the city in striking distance of a half-dozen good Mexican places. Based on the reviews here we went to Mi General.

What a disappointment. On a Sunday evening at 7 p.m. we were one of 2 parties in the place. Flourescent lights. Rickety tables. Recently-mopped floor filled the place with a distinct smell of bleach. TV on behind the absurdly large bar. 

Good: Fresh homemade chips. Tortillas arrived cooked (not steamed in a microwave).  Mom reports enormous frozen margarita was good. Amazingly, a couple other Mexican families came in for dinner while we were there. (normally a good sign.)

Mediocre: Everything else. This place isn&#39;t even trying. Carne asada (skirt steak) was large but chewy. The dish came with yellow rice and blender-ized pinto beans. Nothing special, and no lettuce, sour cream, dash of guac on the plate, something/anything to set it apart. I asked for some lettuce and tomato to add to my tacos and the sliced tomato was hard and pink, mealy and tasteless.  What kind of place would offer that to a paying guest? No one cares enough to choose good produce, apparently.  

The menu is huge and filled with typical dishes you can find in one hundred places. Tacos, burritos, chimichanga, steaks, etc.  

I was excited about trying the seafood that everyone here talked about, but when I asked, of course everything was frozen. Why would I pay a restaurant to microwave defrost some shrimp or tilapia or whatever, then cook it? Blech. So I went with the carne asada.

Dessert was flan. They inexplicably poured bottled chocolate sauce all over it then a small mountain of whipped cream.  On flan. Oy."

I ordered the chimichanga and I wasn&#39;t disappointed. It was flaky yet crispy and so good. And it&#39;s a good deal for the price although their menu items all have great prices. I am 100% sure that I&#39;ll be a repeat customer, I love this place."

(i&#39;m used to a smaller and firmer version) and the chili relleno was good. The batter towards the top was a little underdone but i still had no problem finishing it off!

There is a tiny space to dance, but people do dance, and nobody cares how you dance or if you are too drunk and look horrible dancing lol.

Nothing fancy but they have a decent selection of standard Mexican dishes. I&#39;ve always been a firm believer of keeping things simple and sticking to what you&#39;re good at as a business and this place accomplishes that pretty well. Sure you can go to the cookie cutter corporate Mexican places such as La Magdalena or Chevy&#39;s in the same area but I hate chain restaurants for their unauthentic flavor as much as their cheesy presentation of everything from garnish to decor. Besides, supporting the small business owner as much as possible is beneficial to the entire community. So back to the review on the actual food at Me General. They seem to specialize more in seafood and do a decent job of it. Prices are reasonable for serving size as well as quality. The standard taco and burrito dishes are fresh and tasty. Nothing fancy which is just the way I like it when I&#39;m craving a quick Mexican meal. They serve alcohol and have common Mexican beers such as Corona, Dos Equis, Modelo and the like. The margarita comes in your standard large glass and is nothing special but good all the same. Their taco dinner is huge. At just under $9 you get four tacos, a heap of beans and a pile of rice. A challenge to finish even if you have a healthy appetite. The condiments on the taco can be tailored to your liking but will arrive standard with a little twist of the traditional to tailor to more American tastes. The salsa is made in house and the tortilla chips are fresh. Once again, there&#39;s nothing really fancy about the joint but it is a great local place if you live in the area and are looking for a place that is great for a quick bite to eat. My vote is 3.5 stars but I&#39;ll gladly round up to 4."

A hidden Italian gem in the suburbs. Toscana seems like a true Italian family owned restaurant with some homemade authentic cooking. The food has a homey taste while the service and experience has a quality restaurant feel. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant and dishes, which truly says something great about management.

We shared a bottle of the Cabernet, an excellent choice! (The house red wine was too sweet for my taste) This and the complimentary bread were a delicious start to the meal. We also started with a shrimp appetizer- absolutely delicious! My dad last minute saw this on the menu and threw it in our order, and thank goodness he did! The garlicky sauce is heavenly, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. 

I had the salmon salad as my entree and also shared a bit of the scallop pasta (special of the night) and linguine with clams. All dishes were superb and tasty. The scallop pasta was probably my favorite, and the noodles are perfectly al dente. 

After this excellent meal, we couldn&#39;t resist trying some of their dessert options. We had the carrot cake and pistachio gelato. The gelato was delicious and creamy, and the carrot cake wasn&#39;t bad. 

This great dinner experience will have me forever bragging and bringing my family on special occasions- we love Italian food and have finally found our favorite authentic spot in the suburbs!"

Back bar service was very good as well,eg, plate take aways, water refills, to go boxes.  They were on top of things. 

There was a group of 5 of us for lunch. Plenty of room. I had the shrimp and asparagus risotto. Cooked excellent, though a bit heavy handed with salt. Could be the broth.  Anyway, it was super tastey.  I also had the side of broccolli with garlic, olive oil and pine nuts.  Wow, was that every good.  Minnestroni was pretty good as well. Lots of veggies and more brothy (thin) than soupy. Very good.

I liked the two different kinds of breads for the table, g, italian bread and some kinda tomato focasia. The fresh fish halibut special was excellent as well.  And less than $20.  That hit the spot.  

Not sure if I would visit from the south suburbs, but being 10 min from the office, not bad....Not bad at all."

Let&#39;s just order in. Family indecisive, one starts to improvise a reality TV-style pilot, channeling the Snickers commercial, &#34;You aren&#39;t yourself when you&#39;re hungry,&#34; and being whiny, instead of his fun self; everyone else started to slowly join in. &#34;Wait, this isn&#39;t an improvisation, it&#39;s really happening,&#34; I thought! Someone had to take charge; so it was I. Mom suggests Toscana. There&#39;s a reason that moms are the best. With my pencil and Toscana&#39;s website, I quickly got consensus before the blood sugar got too low.  

Start with a couple Cesar salads? Check. Five pastas, family-style? Check. Mom always gets the Tortellini Paesano; pesto is to my tongue as is music to my ears; you can never go wrong with too much garlic, hence aglio &amp; olio; we mix it up with the Gnocchi Romano, and we&#39;d better get at least one thing that&#39;s healthy, so we round it out with the Heart Healthy. Let&#39;s also invest in a tiramisu and a cannoli to ensure that the meal ends with a sweet taste in our mouths.

I called Toscana. The woman who answered was very friendly, and fine with me figuring out salad dressings, when it turned out that a side salad came with each pasta. It will be ready in 20 minutes. I was there in 20, but... Wow, a desolate, half-occupied strip-mall. Not too promising! I was starting to worry about Mom&#39;s faculties...  But the woman who took my order was there, the food was ready, my card was run; I grabbed the two shopping bags by the handles, ran to the car, squealed out of the desolate parking lot, and was home in 5. Hungry family was happily ready. Food runner/Yelper gives 5 stars to the take-out service.

The food was good, basic Italian fare. Nothing notable, but nothing bad. Mom was right about the Tortellini Paesano. Nothing wrong with a stuffed-pasta with a sauce &amp; vittles reminiscent of carbonara. The pesto and Heart Healthy were also tasty, and it would have been hard to screw up the aglio &amp; olio (though I&#39;ve seen it done). I was of two &#34;minds&#34; regarding the gnocchi (those things have always looked like little brains to me anyway). The gnocchi themselves were the perfect consistency, with the right &#34;chew.&#34; But the tomato sauce on them seemed a little thin--they really could have used a heartier sauce (I was thinking pesto, as I chewed my fettucine that was coated in it.) Dad had been worried that we wouldn&#39;t have bread, but that came with it too.

Mom was spot on in her suggestion. The whole family perked up after lunch and went on to play a rousing board game, had fun, and went on with our lives. 

I love Snickers, but if you don&#39;t have one in the house, Toscana is a good alternative to keep the moods elevated."

I came here because of the good reviews, but unfortunately we didn&#39;t experience much good! When I first walked in, I said I needed a table for two. Both the hostess and another man (I&#39;m guessing the owner/manager of sorts) rudely told me that I could either sit at the bar or leave. Hmmm...thanks I guess? 

Since I had already made plans to meet someone here, I stayed at the bar. The bartender was nice, but no matter where you go, the food service is never as good at the bar, because the bartender is too busy being a bartender. I felt rushed to make a food decision (the menu is pretty short and simple...not very creative or different). I ended up getting a glass of the house chardonnay (not that great), and the pasta with shrimp and white wine sauce. The pasta was hard, there wasn&#39;t much sauce, it was very garlicy, and the shrimp seemed overcooked. My friend said her pasta was hard as well. The salad was plain, but my friend said her soup was good. We were given bread which was decent, and you can make your own olive oil/cheese dipping sauce. Overall I ended spending $30 for a dinner that was not worth $30 at all.

The atmosphere is cute, but this place is tiny and gets so busy. Before we left we had hoards of people standing behind us at the bar waiting for us to leave. We basically felt pressured to leave and it was not a good atmosphere to stay and have conversation (it was very loud...especially with people right behind you loudly talking). We had to ask for a box and our check since we had pretty much been forgotten about. Not a great experience at all. Wouldn&#39;t recommend it, and I won&#39;t be going back."

We ordered some pastas, stuffed shells, veal dish, mussels and sausage. We decided carry out and to my surprise the place looks nice and the hostess was very sweet and polite. We got our food and headed back home. Packaging was prepared nicely and the soups were in these nice green cups not like in those Styrofoam cups. I thought the food was just okay but my boyfriend loved it but I&#39;m assuming he would say that because he didn&#39;t eat all day so he could eat anything right now lol.

The sauce tasted like it came out from a jar, I expected more homemade.  The soup was good, I got chicken jambalaya and also the bread and butter wasn&#39;t too bad either. The pasta was kind of mushy and stuck together, I don&#39;t like eating stuck and mushed together pasta.  I had to add the sauce from my mussels dish on to my pasta because it was bit dry. But overall it&#39;s okay.

No comment on the veal since this is my first time to try veal). In the end we had tiramisu as dessert. It was OK. Regular homey taste as that we usually make at home.

this place is bumping on a friday night, super busy but the staff does a good job getting people in and out. The menu isnt that big but they had A LOT of specials, make sure you ask about the specials cause they are bomb ass. I got a fried chicken alfredo and my boyfriend got a stuff salmon (OMG) so good.
moral of the review, go after the specials...and the pumpkin cheesecake, also really good.
also make a reservation..."
toscana-restaurant-and-lounge-arlington-heights,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,"Buffalo Grove, IL",1,1,1,389,2,1MLbODeWSeI6-LZ1TmyghQ,5.0,2012-06-02,"With so many great Italian restaurants around the Chicagoland area, I&#39;m sure the only thing holding back Toscana from being recognized as one of the greatest is the size and decor. It&#39;s hidden from main streets in a strip mall in Arlington Heights. From the outside it doesn&#39;t really seem impressive and the dark interior fails to tell you much about the restaurant either. The only clue that you might be in for something special is the packed dining room at dinner.

One place Toscana really shines is the food. They feature many reasonably priced daily specials and freshly prepared items. From the start, you&#39;ll enjoy bread that is baked several times a day, out directly from the oven. After that you have a choice of soup or salad, both of which are prepared to perfection. Then you will get to the star of the meal, the main entree. Unlike many Italian restaurants that have very similar dishes only different by sauce and pasta type, Toscana really puts in effort to make sure each dish tastes unique.

Some of my favorites include:

Sea bass with lemon and capers - Crispy seared fish with a delicately flaky inside. It&#39;s probably the next best thing to sushi if you don&#39;t enjoy your fish raw. Definitely a dish fish lovers should try.

Mozzarella Caprese - A simple appetizer but the mix of cheese, tomatoes, basil, and balsamic vinegar are perfect in this dish.

Calamari salad - The calamari is cooked slightly more raw here so that the softness comes out while still presenting a great flavor. I&#39;m not even a big salad person but this was executed so perfectly I couldn&#39;t stop eating it.

Lobster and crabmeat ravioli - Luxurious in a creamy sauce, get this whenever it&#39;s on the specials menu. It has a generous amount of seafood in a perfectly thin ravioli skin.

Tortellini Paesano - One of the homemade pastas with a strong but not overpowering alfredo sauce perfectly counter balanced with mushroom and peas.

Gnocchi - A guilty pleasure of many people, these chewy potato dumplings are also prepared very well here.

Fried calamari linguini - They don&#39;t always have this but it&#39;s fried perfectly with generous amounts of calamari and will easily convert people used to fried shrimp.

Linguini shrimp diavolo - It&#39;s not super spicy but just spicy enough to be enjoyable with perfectly cooked, tasty shrimp.

Linguini broccoli and shrimp - Don&#39;t underestimate this dish because it has broccoli in it. One of the best parts of the dish is the tender broccoli perfectly sauteed in garlic and olive oil. The shrimp matches perfectly with almost an equally heavy flavor and texture.

Chicken milanese - Crispy on the outside, juicy of the inside - this is a perfect substitute for broasted chicken.

As I run close to my character limit for a review, I unfortunately can&#39;t describe any more of the amazing dishes this restaurant offers. However, make sure you finish the meal off with a delicious piece of their home made tiramisu. Buon Appetito!"

The bread, wine and food were all pretty good.  I had the chicken cacciatore - two chicken breasts with onions, tomatoes, peppers, and mushrooms on top and a side of pasta.  I ate pretty much every bite of food on the plate.  The portion was a little small compared to what you usually get at an Italian restaurant, but that was fine because the entree came with salad and bread and I was pleasantly full when I left - not ready to collapse or vomit due to overeating.  I also had the gelato for dessert (chocolate and vanilla) which was really good.  

The issue I have with this place is the service.  I was going to include our server&#39;s name in this review, but I decided not to because I don&#39;t want to be that big a of a jerk.  First off, she rather nastily carded me (I am 32) when I ordered a glass of wine which would have been fine except for the fact that she did NOT card my 24 year old male cousin when he ordered hard liquor.  I can only assume by the way she was smiling and laughing at him all night that she thought he was attractive or something.  Also, it really bothers me when servers ask you to pass them dishes or pass someone else their dishes.  This waitress was constantly making me and others at my table do her job.  Sorry, we are paying to have you bring food out and put it on the table, not to hand it to me just to make me serve the person two places down because you are too lazy.  Lastly, I was in the middle of my meal when the waitress and busboys kept coming over and asking for us to pass them dishes others were done with.  I was trying to eat... could that not have waited?  I felt like I worked there or something.  It was bizarre.  

I would come back here and just hope I got a different waitress.  It does seem unfair to judge the restaurant based on one not so good server.  Again, the food was pretty good and very reasonably priced.  Just be ready to work for it when you get there."

I am happy to see that someone at Toscana cares enough to read customer reviews and even respond.  Unfortunately they don&#39;t seem to care much about good customer service and rather than provide a simple &#34;I am sorry for your bad experience&#34; which would have gone a long way, I get the following excuses and insult instead:

&#34;For your review of: Toscana Restaurant &amp; Lounge
From Toscana Management. 
We took a little time to reply to you. First of all thank you for trying us. We have been in the business for 25 years, 6 years in this location and we will continue to provide top quality service and reasonable prices. Regarding to the calamari dish, it is one of the most favorite appetizers at our restaurant. We sell over 300 pounds a week. Our soups are daily made with fresh ingredients and our salads are nice blends of iceberg lettuce, green leaves, spring mix and more. We can go on but looks like you will not understand the quality of our food. We are going to continue to serve the best and the freshest Italian-American cuisine to the people who know how to appreciate and understand good quality.&#34;


Now, while my review was obviously much less than positive, I wanted to make sure I was not out of line so I took a few minutes to read other reviews here on Yelp as well as on Trip Advisor, Urban Spoon and Google.  Focusing on reviews within the last 12 months, it seems to be a mixed bag of very positive reviews intermixed with others like mine that were also pretty poor.  From this and some of the comments made, it seems possible that Toscana has an issue with consistency.  With that said though, from the negative reviews, here are some of the comments that fit my experience and the review I wrote:

&#34;Tough calamari&#34;, seems as if it were microwaved
Calamari was &#34;not great&#34;
Salad was &#34;nothing special&#34;
Food tasted like it was &#34;frozen&#34;
Food tasted like it came (from a can)
Pasta was clumped together
Tomato sauce tasted as if it were &#34;out of a jar&#34;
Food seemed to have been &#34;frozen&#34; and &#34;store bought&#34;
Fish was dry
Soup was flavorless and made with canned broth
&#34;Not professionally run&#34;  

The last one rings true considering the lovely message that Toscana Management sent me above.  

Let me tell you folks at Toscana something, I generally give any place a second shot, and certainly if the experience improved I would update my review accordingly.  However, when I get a message from the management that is so rude and ignores any sort of customer service whatsoever and simply makes excuses and tells me, the customer I lack the ability to understand the  &#34;quality&#34; of their food, I forget the second shot and simply go elsewhere. 

 I think I am sophisticated enough to know when food is cold in the middle rather than hot.  I think I know limp lettuce when I get it and I most certainly know when pasta is dry and when calamari is tough, chewy and flavorless.  It doesn&#39;t matter to me how much Toscana sells.  Perhaps if they focused less on selling 300 pounds a week and focused more on quality, I and the others who have written bad reviews would be happy and returning customers.  

For those interested, if you want a much better Italian experience in the relatively nearby area (all just off of Central) try the following:

Joe &amp; Guiseppe - (Central and Arthur in Arlington Heights)
Giacomo&#39;s - (Central and Wolf in Des Plaines)
Café Lucci - (Central and Milwaukee in Glenview)

From my experiences, all three of these are far superior to Toscana and I highly doubt any of them would be so insulting to a customer who had a bad experience.

Sorry Toscana, I guess my unsophisticated pallet simply doesn&#39;t understand your high quality.  I am sure though that these other are happy to take my business."

This place was close to the house with outside seating.  I had been there before and it was fine, but not my first choice when I think of good Italian.  However, I did not expect to experience the humiliation and discrimination that was shown to me.  My fiancé ordered a beer and glass of wine for me.  20 minutes later our server said she was delaying drinks because she wasn&#39;t sure she could serve to us.  I looked at her confused and asked if she was 21 or new, maybe she couldn&#39;t serve?  When she answered yes she&#39;s 21 and laughed, I then thought okay maybe she needs my ID? I was completely clueless when she fired back &#34;your pregnant.&#34;  I was shocked and stared at her rather than get up and walk out.  My fiancé was also stunned and the couple seated nearby asked if we were on candid camera or that show &#34;what would you do,&#34; lol.  So we laughed it off and I didn&#39;t want to make a scene, however I was completely embarrassed and felt much discrimination obviously against my body.  Furthermore, she then offered free ice cream and knocked $5 off our bill.  What a joke!  Very sad an establishment such as this one, lack in professionalism and simple etiquette.  Nice concern, but some advice; next time don&#39;t assume and humiliate customers in front of public!"

I placed a reservation for Toscana on yelp reviews alone--had never heard of the place, but the reviews seemed great and one look-thru the menu online I was sold.  Italian is probably my favorite cuisine and there are plenty of Italian joints around, but this establishment is really fantastic and better than any chain.  Don&#39;t let a strip mall place fool you--it was PACKED and everybody just has the most pleasant look on their face.

The room is very noisy, but don&#39;t let that bother you--the wait staff is amazing and are there to make sure your dining experience is wonderful.  We visited this restaurant on Friday night for my Mom&#39;s birthday and everyone was pleased with their food.  Everything from the flavored olive oil, to the bread, to the salads, to the entrees, and to the dessert --was excellent.  Portions are a good size, not too big, not too small and definitely worth the price.  $15 for Veal--yes please!!!  And my huge glass of House Riesling for $6 wasn&#39;t too shabby either :)

There was never a moment where we weren&#39;t supplied with bread and our drinks were always properly attended to.  

For 6 people (drinks, dinner, and dessert) the bill was only $200, you simply cannot beat that!!"

My wife and I discovered this place literally right behind our condo so it was an obvious choice as our go-to spot for good quick Italian food. The Carbonara with Cappellini noodles is amazing! It&#39;s the best Carbonara I&#39;ve had outside of my travels to Florence and Rome, Italy which says a lot. Their Tiramisu is consistently delicious as is their salads. Prices are extremely affordable too.

Mind you we have not actually dined-in yet because my experiences even with their to-go service has left me with mixed feelings so I would not expect their dine-in to be any better. After 6 carry-outs we either received the wrong order, the incorrect type of noodles requested, overcooked and inconsistent pasta, and a lack of competent phone and social skills from the various hosts who took our orders.  My guess is they must hire local high school kids to play host.

Overall my complaints are minor and even if we didn&#39;t live behind the restaurant I think we would still continue give them our business because their food is just that good. If they moved out from their sketchy strip mall location to, say, downtown Arlington Hts and they were able to improve customer experience I say they could EASILY go upscale..

I ordered rigatoni with bolognese. I thought it was not the best I have had, but that is just because I like the bolognese at some other places better. The quality was very good. My wife and our friend ordered the carbonara and I had a little of that, too, and thought it was delicious.

We ordered some of the mussels in white sauce, which my wife and our friend seemed to really enjoy. We also had some antipasto, which was pretty good.

They serve bread on arrival, which I like, and it was nice and warm.

Antipasto - very good; bread - the best anywhere;  soup - good,; manicotti - good;  prices - very good.  Went for lunch on a Sunday.  We had not been there in quite a while and found good food and excellent service.  Is it the best Italian food I have ever had, no, but it is good.

First off I had veal marsala... the sauce was way too sweet. I asked for my side pasta to be a vodka sauce, it was awful. It was a combination of marinara &amp; vodka? Gross. Plus served w/ angel hair pasta. Vodka sauce should be served with penne noodles.... My Fiancé ordered their &#34;special&#34; which was a skirt steak. He ordered it medium/rare. It came well done... Service was awful. Our waiter kept handing all our dishes to the wrong ppl at the table. Seriously? Only 4 ppl and she couldn&#39;t keep anything straight. We were passing our soups, salads &amp; dishes around the table to the correct person... Irritating. Any way NOT going back. Not worth $50 for 2 awful dishes."

The vesuvio sauce had a good garlic presence. Likely too much for some dinners. My wife and I loved it. My wife&#39;s meat ravioli was cook al dente and had a good flavor with a  marinara that allows the flour of the tomatoes to come through. Also she had a side of italian sausage that was the star. The fennel permeated the finely ground pork which was soft and delicious. This italian sausage was not a traditional version my grandmother made but still was a version that I want more of.

We really enjoyed our time there!  Very cute little place with a VERY attentive, friendly (and traditional Italian!) staff.

We sat at the bar while we waited for our outdoor table and our very lovely bartender (Gayla??) took very good care of us.

We were mixed on the decor.  My wife found the Italian Village scene painted on the wall a bit tacky.  I was okay with it - a bit cheesy but I kinda like that stuff but not everyone will.  

Pretty good wine selection, a very nice frog leg appetizer, decent pasta, VERY good seafood risotto (my wife said she never had risotto with that much seafood and easier on the rice) - they really don&#39;t skimp on that dish!  

We sat outside with mixed results.  Romantic yes (once you eventually tune out the fact that you&#39;re looking out onto a very lame parking lot).  However, in the summer, the bugs out there were VERY bad which definitely put a damper.  They lit torches but that did very little.

B/c it was a hot night, we got the wild berry Italian Ice and shared it (which was very refreshing).

My take on the service: slow, yes.  But in their defense, I honestly think they took a very traditional Italian approach to dinner (slow down, don&#39;t rush to your next course or your desert, etc).  I&#39;ve seen very traditional Italian places do this so I really didn&#39;t hold it against them.  

I&#39;d say prices were fairly reasonable: $116 including tip (minus $25 restaurant.com gift certificate) for very large frog leg app, two above average salads, pasta dish, generous seafood risotto, decent sized desert, a bottle or wine, then 2 extra wines by the glass.

Bottom line, very nice job, Toscana, we&#39;ll be back!"

We had the raviolis (both meat as well as cheese) and the eggplant parmigiana, both covered in their &#34;red&#34; sauce. The raviolis didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor and both dishes were disappointing because of their red sauce. It was basically tomato paste, canned tomatoes, and salt/pepper. ADD SOME SEASONING!

We found this place from the yelp reviews as we often do when we are traveling. It&#39;s in an unassuming strip-mall almost un-noticeable except for the patio seating outside. There were a few lone diners, but mainly groups of families and friends. As busy as the small dining-room was, it looked like they did an equal amount of business with people calling for take-out.

The staff attends to each table in a manner found only at the Michelin four-star restaurants I&#39;ve visited. Not a single need goes un-met, before you even realize you had the need. They offer an extensive wine list for almost every palette. But this place is about the food. Oh, the food!!

We were treated with home-baked breads coupled with quality olive oil at the table. The appetizers were outstanding, but it is the entrees that really shine. I had one of their many specials not on the regular menu: Melt in your mouth briscole that exploded with flavor. &#34;Special&#34; is an understatement here to clue you in to what you MUST try. The sauce was one of those cooked-all-day melds of flavor that almost made me light-headed because it tasted soooooo good. I was instantly transported back in my mind to another off-the-beaten path restaurant I found in Venice. While I cannot say whether or not this place was Northern of Southern Italian cuisine, I can attest that it was FANTASTIC!!!

My husband had the manicotti made from fresh noodles and a distinctively different red sauce that most certainly was produced from a long slow simmer. Our teenage daughter chose eggplant parmigiana that for once made me reconsider her vegetarian choices as worthwhile.

My only regret for the meal was that as first-timers we ate way-too quickly. This is the kind of place that you bring your closest friends and family. It&#39;s the closest thing you can find to Italy without actually flying there. It is special and like all great meals is meant to be shared in the company of people you love because this is food made with love. Not only for special occasions, but this restaurant is all about the experience of what dining should be every day of the week!"

Soooo glad we did!   

We were greeted in a friendly manner and seated right away in one of the two last remaining tables open (this was on a Sunday at about 5pm).  We both thoroughly enjoyed what we got (Carbonara for my husband, Eggplant Parmigania for me).  The pasta was perfectly cooked and the Eggplant Parmigania was the BEST I&#39;ve ever had....very thinly sliced eggplant, a HUGE serving (plus a side of penne with marinara on the side which I didn&#39;t expect!).  I dreamt about it all night long and luckily could have it again for lunch the next day as there was plenty to bring home!  The wait staff was fantastic and  the owner or manager stopped by our table to be sure everything was to our liking.

This is after he agreed to it on the phone.  He was having 2 other parties  later that day in the same room so it was not like he was losing money on the day.

The waitress was very helpful in helping identify several vegetarian options, and all of them were fantastic. The brushetta, minestrone soup, and pasta with vodka sauce were all wonderful, and for dessert I had a great affogato. The price ended up being about $40 for three people.

Lastly, it was a small thing, but I noticed and I appreciated it. We were the only customers when we had arrived. Some time into our meal,  I put my coat back on since I was cold.

Delightfully-friendly and delicious restaurants, surprising found in strip malls. . . Toscana is one of those delights. 

This evening I was invited to dinner with my aunt and uncle, who live in Arlington Heights, and consider Toscana to be a regular restaurant in their dining repertoire. My uncle, a fabulous cook, who has even been on TV for cooking, says this is one of their favorite &#39;I&#39;ve had too long of a day to pretend to cook like Rachel Ray&#39; restaurants. I can see why they love the restaurant after spending just one evening at Toscana. 

The staff at Toscana is sweet, neighborly and warm; I kind of felt like they were all giving me special attention when I walked in, but after watching for a while, that&#39;s just how they are - very refreshing - I haven&#39;t felt that in a while. The wine list is easy, drinkable and quick to the table (hell, yeah). The food is non-chain, family-recipe styled and delicious. Our entire table followed the &#39;Toscana Specials&#39; and every dish was delightful and well cooked. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and will be back again. Oh, I had the penne pasta with Italian sausage (which was cooked to perfection), roasted garlic, spinach and dry ricotta, along with the roasted lentil soup. mmm. hmmm.

There would also be outdoor dining, and this area would be very charming, as well.  Their pasta would have to be homemade.  Their pizza would be delightful.  This was my dream.

Suddenly, as I drove past the strip mall at Central and New Wilke- there it was!  I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes so I quickly pulled into the parking lot and jumped out of my car.  As I approached Toscana I slowly realized that my dream had come true.  I couldn&#39;t be sure until I tasted the food, so I took a couple of delivery menus with me.

I had salad and my friend ordered soup.. unfortunately we knew we wouldn&#39;t have enough time to eat these so we took them to go and our server was more than happy to do that for us.  I ordered the veal parmasean, which was very delicious and my only complaint was that it was two thin slices of veal.  I would have rather had one thick slice, but the price was right at $15.  My sister ordered a shrimp and brocoli dish, shrimp cooked perfectly!  We also ordered a side of meatballs, because being Italian ourselves we have determined that the best way to see how good an Italian restaurant is is to try the meatballs.  And these were nearly as good as my own... not AS good as Grandma&#39;s but very very good.

Hidden away in a strip mall, the atmosphere is very cozy and I would highly recommend this place to anyone, Italian or not."

It&#39;s also very noisy due to bare floors and close quarters!  Decided not to return as they didn&#39;t correct their mistakes. Some of my friends also decided to go elsewhere for lunch.  Just down the way is Sam&#39;s, which has greatly improved since being taken over by the owners nephew.  It now feels like home and the food is very good, consistant, plentiful, and reasonably priced.  They don&#39;t have outdoor seating, however.  But if you&#39;re in the area, try out this neighborhood spot that&#39;s been here for a long time - and will hopefully be here for a long time to come!  I&#39;m giving Toscana&#39;s two stars for the bread they sometimes bring to the table and the pleasant waitress who has served us on a few occasions."

Somehow I totally missed this neighborhood restaurant. I got take-out for my mom and me and it was pretty darned good. My Heart Healthy spaghetti (tomato sauce with broccoli, mushrooms and spinach) was excellent. I got the cheese lasagna for my mom and it was good too, but I preferred my entree. Portion sizes were very respectable, with at least one or two more meals from each as leftovers. Each came with a house salad which was serviceable and a side of bread. The bread was a little on the dry side, but OK overall. We got one cannoli to split and it was one of the richest cannolis I&#39;ve ever had. And the shell was covered in chocolate - a first. We&#39;ll definitely be adding Toscana to our take-out menus and I&#39;ll try dining in as well."

We went there 2 times both in large group. Most of us enjoyed the food over there. The service is also good even when they are crowded. 

I tried lamb shank and it is fantastic. I also love the fried calamari. They are very tender inside. Perfectly fried to me. 

They serve two kinds of breads and I enjoyed the pizza bread. 

We also ordered dessert to share, and they all are fairly good.  

I would recommend you give it a try. 

Btw, I have very high standard in terms of rating. 3 stars for me means I will go back. I rarely give anything more than 3."

We came here to have a nice relaxing dinner to catch up with our daughter who came home from college.  But instead we had an uncomfortable experience.  We felt so rushed.  Our dinners came out too quick.  I didn&#39;t even finish my salad and the waitress was standing over me waiting to take my plate.  My husband and I ordered Linguini and Calamari which we felt was microwaved and the calamari was very tough which is unusual.  My daughter had gnocchi which she liked. Also the bread was very good
I am not an exceptionally slow eater, but again the waitress was standing by our table while I finished my dinner.  I had to box it because it was so uncomfortable.  There were a lot of people waiting, so I am sure that is why they were rushing us.  We will not come back here for a long time.  There are too many other good restaurants in town."

My Mom order this seafood platter which was fried and disgusting. My dad ordered the gnocki in the vodka sauce. which tasted like it was fresh out of a can from jewel. My girlfriend ordered the chicken piccitta It was okay but ive had better at many other places. Our waitress sucked absolutely no personality when i asked her to describe the sea food special she looked at me like I was the neediest person in the world.

Last time i had the clam chowder and the baked gnocchi special; pancetta, spinach, and lots of garlic and mozzarella. I know...I just can&#39;t resist a bowl of clam chowder when offered one.  Both were fantastic.  Have had the veal parm and a few other dishes, all very good. Dishes were all served steaming hot, which is also a plus.

Very pretty inside and a great place to take friends and family. It&#39;s a little loud inside, but any place almost packed on a Tuesday night is worth it!!

First off it is a bit easy to look past considering it&#39;s location on the highway and connected to a liquor store- but don&#39;t let the location fool you it is a
Hidden gem!! 

I&#39;ve been here twice now and both times I&#39;m super impressed! 

Have been able to try different things both times I visited but some of my favorites include the creamy
Corn starter, the shrimp taco ( al camelion) and the beer battered tilapia tacos. And the ranchero masa. All super tasty dishes with really great flavors.

The margaritas were also such a hit- the original was well made and the perfect blend, not to mention great presentation on the drink as well as the food!

Roberto is the owner, really nice guy.  He has 2 other restaurants, one of which I have already been to.  It&#39;s in Geneva and it&#39;s called Altiro, and it&#39;s also really good.

His restaurants aren&#39;t the typical Mexican food, it&#39;s more fusion, which means they have some flavors and dishes you may not be used to.

For this particular location, it may be a little hard to find.  It&#39;s actually on the on/off ramp for Rt. 38 and 59.

The inside is decorated very nice.  It may actually have been the nicest / most upscale feeling Mexican restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to.  Don&#39;t let that fool you though, the prices are roughly the same as many other places.  

Definitely worth trying."

I was a fan of the Mexican restaurant previously in this storefront (around that curvy bend of Roosevelt and Route 59, next to a liquor store) and curious to see what opened in its place.

West Chicago is not the first town that comes to mind when thinking of new restaurants to try.  In the west suburbs it&#39;s usually Geneva, Naperville, but not West Chicago - a residential and industrial town that just gets confused with the actual city of Chicago.  So it&#39;s exciting to see something new and different in the area.

The interior of the restaurant is dim and open.  With tables positioned somewhat close together, I was surprised that other conversations did not overpower ours.

The menu is composed of dishes that are easily shareable, but as the waiter jovially pointed out, &#34;you don&#39;t have to share if you don&#39;t want to!&#34;  Tacos come in an order of 4 for $10, but these are on the smaller side, so eating 4 is not exactly a challenge.  I had the pastor tacos and loved the spicy kick.  It would have been nice to have a mix-and-match taco option though, because there were so many others I would have liked to try!

For sides, we shared the guacamole and spicy corn.  The guacamole was good, but for $8 I thought the portion was too tiny, and it&#39;s really just guacamole.  The spicy corn was delicious; one of their most popular dishes.  It&#39;s similar to an elote.

The drink menu is like a gift from god after a long day.  Margaritas, palomas, mojitos, and more!  I had the Hibiscus Cocktail (it had a funky name, but that&#39;s what it was) which was fresh, strong, and well worth whatever the pricetag was on it.

We had no problem getting a table on a Wednesday evening.  I&#39;ve visited a similar taco spot in Geneva (not Altiro) which often has wait times of an hour or longer.  Forget the cache of dining in Geneva and give Al Chulo a try."

We visited on a cold and rainy night. As others have said, the door opens right into the dining room. They wanted to seat us near the door and I told them I had to sit far away from it. I don&#39;t like eating with my coat on and I had to even though I was far away from the door. Although they try to make the interior nice, the chairs reminded me of plastic patio chairs. You can put a nice pillow on those, but they are still hard and don&#39;t really encourage taking your time to eat.

The drink menu is loaded with different kinds of mixed drinks which are about $10 each. Mine was good, but for $10 it should have had more liquor. There are no beers listed, we had to ask and yes they do have some.

The menu is limited and was kind of confusing. We had several questions and then ordered some tacos. They were tasty. We also had their selection of salsas and some chips. Those were flavorful.

I used the women&#39;s restroom and it was clean, but there was no toilet paper holder! It was just indicative of how they seemed to miss on the little things at this place.

There weren&#39;t many diners in the place, yet we felt like we were ignored. There wasn&#39;t any kind of extra effort made to make sure we were enjoying our experience. You can get the food right, but without the great service and surroundings, it just doesn&#39;t work for me."

First, the chips and salsa here are not complimentary, and they&#39;re just as overpriced as everything on the menu. The tacos are extremely expensive without reason. The tacos aren&#39;t bad but I would&#39;ve been happier spending the same amount on more tacos at any given taco place. I have no problem paying a higher price , but at that price I should at least leave with a full belly. The drinks are very tasty but should come in either bigger proportions or more alcohol given that they&#39;re ten dollars a piece. The service was good. If you&#39;re coming here you&#39;re paying for fancy plates and oblong bowls. Not worth it."

I finally got my chance on Saturday and it was definitely worth the wait.  We started out with the Al Arroz Verde (creamy corn/poblano rice) which was out of this world. It tasted so fresh and creamy, but not heavy. If we had not been in the middle of a restaurant, I would have definitely licked the bowl clean! Next was the guacamole - some of the best I&#39;ve ever had - fresh, chunky and full of flavor without too much heat. Next came the Al Tingo (shredded chicken piled on 3 mini tostadas) - the fresh flavor exploded in your mouth. Then came 4 Al Poblano Tacos which were covered in the creamy poblano sauce used in the Al Arroz - need I say more. We finished off our meal with the Tres Leches for dessert -  that was a wonderful exclamation point on a fabulous dinner. 

Service was fabulous! Can&#39;t wait to go back and try the rest of the menu and the handmade margaritas!

It&#39;s very exciting to have such a high quality restaurant in our small little town."

Unfortunately, the shrimp tacos only have one shrimp with cheese leaving me wanting for more substance within each individual taco. The corn dip was very delicious and so were the pork tacos. The flan was excellent with a hint of coffee flavor, but again they gave you a VERY small portion, 3-4 bites, for the price. If they increase the amount of product witin each taco and other plates as well, I feel that they would have more business. The price was a lot for what he were given. Very beautiful decor, but I believe they need to alter their dishes and make sure the ratio of tortilla to meat to make the customers more happy. I understand that it is an upscale Mexican restaurant, but some of their items needed a little more. My mother ended up adding guacamole to the shrimp tacos since all it consisted of was 1. The corn tortilla 2. One tiny, mini shrimp and 2. Melted cheese. Great flavors, though, just needs improvement on certain dishes overall."

However, we were very excited to learn that Al Chulo was gonna be opening in that same location. After hearing great things about the place, my fiancé and I decided to stop in for a late dinner last night. First off the decor is very classy and totally different from the Luchador masks that were on the walls when it was Changaro. We were seated right away. The place wasn&#39;t overly crowded but it was also 8:30pm. 
  We started with chips and guacamole. We both tried their specialty margaritas. My fiancé loved the passion fruit one. Next we tried a few of their different tacos. Now if you are looking for traditional taco joint style tacos, this place is not for you. There are no basic ground beef, lettuce, and cheese tacos or burritos on this menu. However, if you want to broaden your palate and try some amazing food this is the spot. We had the al pastor tacos, fish tacos, and a steak &amp; chorizo sope. The al pastor tacos were better than the authentic ones we had when we were in Mexico. The sope was pretty amazing as well. Overall we very pleased with our food and drink choices.
   I have read several complaints on yelp about the service there. We had a great dining experience. Our waiter was actually Miguel, the owner of the restaurant. He is a great guy and has a true passion for what he does. He chatted with us throughout our meal and as the place died down he sat with us and had some great conversations. He even brought us out shots of his private reserve tequila. 
    Our quick late night dinner ended up being a 2.5 hr great dining experience. It goes to show you, treat everyone equally with kindness because we thought he was just a waiter and ended up being the owner and treating us very well. 
    I highly recommend this place if you want a  nontraditional mexican fusion delicious meal. We even talked to Miguel about catering our wedding. Please support this place so it sticks around. It is nice not having to drive to Geneva to deal with the long wait times at Bien Trucha. Miguel also owns Altiro in Geneva as well so go show some love and have a kick ass meal."

Service was good and the staff took their time to explain the different options.  Decor is very modern. Seating is not all that comfortable in the bench area although it looks pretty. Portions are appetizer sized but felt satisfied and full. Good was fresh and presentation was very appealing. Would be a great place to bring out of town guests for something unique that you don&#39;t have to drive to the larger suburbs to find.

Started with the Al Esquite roasted corn appetizer and the Al Camaleon shrimp/bacon/avocado tacos, which in end-of-meal review came out as close favorites.  Honestly, we could have each happily had our own bowl of the corn, but wanted to try more things. For seconds we shared Al Ceviche tortas (towers of lime-marinated Tilapia with red onions, tomatoes, avocado) and the Al Chulo tacos (steak, ham, bacon, cheese).  Almost full, we wanted &#34;dessert,&#34; so had Al Hongo portabellos roasted with chile and a sour cream/roasted salsa combo that did actually come across as slightly and deliciously sweet. I can&#39;t forget to mention the candy-in-a-glass mojito, worth breaking my usual tee-totalling tendencies.  I wish we had taken photos, but we really just wanted to eat this food as soon as it landed on the table.  We were there @ 1:15 on a Tuesday and it was almost empty, so we hope it builds the business it deserves (since it will be the new go-to restaurant for us)!"

The flavors were delicious and the temperature of the steak was perfect. Even the bun was so good and very fresh.  I can&#39;t wait to come back for dinner!

I had the sangria, which was very tasty. 
We ordered the ceviche, guacamole, a creamy corn and rice casserole (can&#39;t remember the exact name) and the shredded pork tacos. This corn/rice dish was probably our favorite thing, and we enjoyed everything. (We ordered a 2nd helping of the rice/corn dish after we quickly finished the first one.)
I&#39;m sorry that we were too full for dessert; I can&#39;t wait to try their tres leche cake or their flan. (Next visit.)
The service was wonderful - both of the servers were very attentive and pleasant. They really loved that we enjoyed everything.
Guests need to keep in mind that this is tapas style, so they are small plates, meant to be shared. A few of the other commenters didn&#39;t seem to understand that. They are priced reasonably to all the other upscale tapas restaurants in this area; the bill was not more than we expected for the amount of food we ordered and again, we loved everything.

One recommendation for the menu is to create a combo of tacos. I would have loved to try more than the pork tacos.

They changed the location of the front door from the previous restaurant; it now opens up into the dining area. In the warmer months this won&#39;t be a problem at all, but it was cold tonight, and when the door opened, a gust of air blew right into the main area. Knowing this, we&#39;ll ask for a corner table when it&#39;s cold. 

We really can&#39;t wait to come back again. We&#39;ll try all new dishes, but we&#39;re always going to order the corn/rice dish. 

As my husband, Dan Milligan says, &#34;Don&#39;t be a fool-o, eat at Al Chulo.&#34;"

After that, the rest of my review goes downhill.
First walking in to the restaurant, you see the updated atmosphere, pretty wall paper and fancy chairs. Not bad. The tables are super close together though. My husband and I were seated along the wall and I had to squeeze between 2 tables to get to the bench (I&#39;m not a big person either). If there was someone at the table next to us, we&#39;d have no privacy whatsoever. 
We looked at the menu and saw that the salsas were $6 each. Ok...not a fan, but we ordered one anyways. The salsa came out and it was at most 2 tablespoons worth. Not enough for 2 people. We were able to eat about 4-5 chips each with that one salsa. I don&#39;t want to spend $12+ on just salsa. We tried the guacamole as well...it came out looking pretty, but again, small portion. And very salty. Won&#39;t order that again. At this point we said something to our waiter about the size of salsa. The chef ended up coming out and explained that everything there was made fresh so the portions are smaller and more expensive. I get it...but lots of other places make their food fresh and it&#39;s not so expensive. 
I ordered the chicken taco that was fried with potato and cheese (sorry, forgot the name of it...El Donato maybe), but it tasted like fried tortilla. I could not even taste the chicken, potato or cheese. My husband ordered the &#34;Al Chulo&#34; taco...and that was good. 
So,  the food here is just ok. I understand they just opened and maybe have kinks to work out...but this was my first experience there. The portions are &#34;tapas&#34; style which I understand...but I still think they are too small. I do not think my food was worth $90 including tip. Not in West Chicago. Might come back in a couple of months to see if anything changed."

They have more sophisticated palettes than most adults. The decor is very cool and modern for the location and the town of West Chicago.....I give it an A for effort. Tables are a bit small but they don&#39;t bring out the food all at once so its not such a big deal. Most Americans see a Mexican restaurant and expect burritos as big as your head and the typical gringo fair! You won&#39;t get that here. The food at Al Chulo is upscale modern tapas style Mexican. If your looking for a gluttonous American chain type of experience, then this isn&#39;t your place. Prices may be higher than most but your not getting your average tuesday night fast meal for you and the family. 

I loved it and will definitely be back. Its so important to patronize small business in your community. I know this......as Ive owned one for 23 years and always appreciate the kindness of my patrons!"

I&#39;m not sure if the other 2 star reviewer realized this. You wouldn&#39;t get a side of rice and beans because it&#39;s not that type of restaurant. That said, we walked in and were left standing there waiting. 4 different employees saw us and did nothing. When they finally came over we were seated at a high top table with a window seat. Not comfortable! We asked to move once a table opened up. Food was ok. Ceviche tostada had to much lime juice. Queso fundido was cold, so it was hard. Pastor and shrimp tacos were good. Too much time between dishes. We found ourselves sitting there waiting a few times. I know they just opened, but they have some kinks to work out. Not sure if we&#39;ll return or not.

My husband and I live close, and the place that was here before (Changarro) shut down- it was awesome and we hoped this would kind of be a replacement. Upper scale Mexican is hard to come by in the burbs. 

The decor is pretty, but not functional. Maybe the window seats with high tables would have been better, but we were sat in the middle of the room next to another couple despite being the only ones in there. The table was so small, and I couldn&#39;t comfortably cross my legs underneath it (I&#39;m 5&#39;1) it was not cozy at all. 

Drinks were great, and were much like the previous establishment- fresh muddled, proper margaritas. 
We ordered the salsa sampler and they were all delicious but extremely small portions with a tiny basket of chips. 

My husband ordered tinga style chicken tacos and he liked them. 
I&#39;m vegan, and I understand this can be a &#34;pain in the ass&#34; to some waiters. I don&#39;t expect to be fully catered to everywhere I go but I&#39;ve never been somewhere that tweaking a few things wasn&#39;t a problem. Aside from salsa and guac there was nothing for me. I asked if they could grill up some peppers, onion and potatoes for tacos. Pretty simple....but what they sent out was completely different. Beans, a slaw and what may have been grilled cactus. They weren&#39;t bad, but I don&#39;t think what I ordered would have been difficult to whip up...and I would have enjoyed more. 
The tacos are really small, and they don&#39;t come with a side of rice or beans etc. 

The service is....brand new restaurant service. Possibly brand new to serving service. They were nice and they tried, but more experience is definitely needed here. 

Also...my tacos came out first, and my husbands order took another 10+ minutes...kind of killed the &#34;dinner together&#34; vibe. 

It&#39;s unfortunate, but I don&#39;t see this place lasting :("

It&#39;s Father&#39;s day, so I got to pick the place for dinner.  I had fond memories of Texas Roadhouse from when we actually lived in Texas. Come to think of it, I had not been back to one in about 9 years; not because I didn&#39;t like it, but the nearest TR to me is a 35 mile round trip from my home.  Since it is only about 10 minutes from my wife&#39;s work, we decided to meet at the TR in Crystal Lake.

There was a crazy wait, but I had called ahead, so it was only about 10 minutes from the time we checked in. Not bad for Father&#39;s day.

We started with the fried pickles and bread for an appetizer. Both were very good.  I ordered a Fillet, my wife had the Salmon, and my daughter ordered a half slab of the Ribs.

All of the Entrees were excellent.  Like I said, I and not been to a TR in a long time, but as I recall the food was always really good, and the prices are reasonable for what you get.

My biggest take away here is the quality of the steak. I had the 8 oz. Fillet. It was cooked perfectly to my order, and was perfectly trimmed. There was absolutely no fat or gristle, and the steak was extremely tender and flavorful.

The steaks here are USDA choice, and they are hand cut at each restaurant.
The surprising thing is I&#39;ve had worse steaks at Morton&#39;s and some other more upscale steak places. The quality is a notch above Outback, Lone Star, Longhorn, and other similar steak restaurants. So.. I&#39;m pretty impressed especially considering the price.

The service was very friendly, although they were pretty slammed, so the drink refills got lost in the shuffle as they were handed off to a backup server. When our main server came back, she immediately noticed, and got us go cups for the way home.

Bottom line, it was a very good dinner. If they had one closer to my home, I&#39;d go more often."

We ordered a single rack of ribs and it was good enough for 3 people with enough leftover for a meal for fourth person. Caveat - we also had their sides of salad (which is meh). Their ribs were a bit over-charred on outside but meat came of the bones easily. 

We were served by Morgan - she was very professional, prompt and took excellent care of our table. She suggested the sweet potatoes with marsh-mellows (an odd combination in view of some of the members of our party) but it made for a great dessert. 

However, be a bit careful about their billing - they dont always tell you that some of the things they are suggesting - like a particular sauce or dressing - would cost extra and we noticed it on our bill."

Next up, I had the Country Fried Steak, which is large enough it has its own plate; the two sides came on their own plate. I had mashed taters and corn.

I called ahead to make our reservation, but come to find out, you can&#39;t.  They only allow you to call an hour before your arrival and give you a number to use when you check-in.  They have some funny name for it, but I don&#39;t recall.  So, we arrived 15 minutes before our requested time and were greeted by an astonishing amount of hostesses...I&#39;m not joking when I say about 8-10!!  It was a bit overwhelming with all of them trying to greet you at the same time.  I gave them my number, which was three digits and a letter...not the easiest to remember.  We then were given a buzzer and sent to sit down and munch on peanuts... we could chuck the shells on the ground.  Clearly, this is more of a sports bar than a steakhouse...there were flat screen televisions in every nook and corner they could possibly be placed.

We were guided through the maze of servers singing and dancing everywhere...a bit of a chaotic mess, in my opinion.  Right after we sat down, we were delivered some tasty rolls with some cinnamon butter concoction...highlight of the meal.  Our server came over and greeted us with her t-shirt that tells all the patrons that &#34;I heart being here&#34;  LOL! Extremely cheesy.  Our server was pleasant enough.  She took our drink orders and appetizer.  about 8-10 minutes later, our drinks arrived.  Shortly after, our fried pickles arrived.  The top few pickles were good, but when we got down to the bottom, they were uneatable since they were swimming in a pool of oil...gross!  I would not recommend these.

We placed our entree orders and had some conversation.  However, the conversation was constantly interrupted by the spontaneous line dancing by the servers.  Kinda stupid.  On top of that, it seems like every other table had a birthday celebration.  This meant that a group of servers would swarm the table and begin singing at the top of their lungs to the, in most cases, unwelcoming birthday person.  They even brought out some horse saddle thing and try and persuade them to jump on...I didn&#39;t see any takers.

On to our entrees.  I ordered the Half Ribs with Pulled pork and sides of apple sauce and corn.  The apple sauce never arrived, so I can&#39;t comment on that.  The ribs were okay, but kind of dry.  The pulled pork was the highlight for me, but the BBQ sauce that it was drenched in just wasn&#39;t to my liking.  I wish they had an option to have it on the side, or have a couple different sauces to choose from.  The corn had a pool of butter that it was in, hence the name buttery corn.  This was not a meal for anyone worried about their waste line.

My wife had the Sirloin and Shrimp with mashed potatoes.  She liked the shrimps, which I sampled, and were good enough.  The mashed potatoes tasted like boxed potatoes...clearly not made fresh.  She ordered the steak medium, but came well done...absolutely no pink.  Some guy, not our server, came over to check on our orders and we informed him that the steak was over cooked.  He took it back and said he would bring out a new steak.  The steak came after the rest of the table was done eating.  His way of making it up, was to offer a free appetizer on our next visit.  I guess this is his attempt to get us back in the door.  Most place would simply take it off the bill.  Not the best customer service.  Our waitress came later and asked how everything was going and we told her about the steak.  She said &#34;oh, I&#39;m sorry.  I didn&#39;t know he took it away.  They never tell us that stuff.&#34;  They need to work on communicating with one another....gave the appearance that they are still working out some kinks.  Unprofessional.  She said the same thing again as she apologized when she delivered us our bill...it wasn&#39;t her fault, but more so the manager that has clearly never managed a restaurant before.

My father order the BBQ chicken and it was a thin chicken breast that was nothing special.  My young girls had a joke of a burger.  Dry and tasteless.

Overall, I would only recommend coming here if you enjoy chainy experiences where they could care less about quality and more about shuffling in and out as many patrons as possible.

On a side note, good luck finding a parking spot!!  We were here on a Tuesday night and were lucky to find a spot in their lot.  Many were left to walk from the Sports Authority lot or Portillo&#39;s."

The music is playing loud, so we had no idea what our hostess said as she guided us to our table (something about steaks, and bread).  After we were seated, our waitress was very nice.  Our drinks and salads came quick as did our dinner.  Prices are pretty reasonable, the pulled pork was nice and tender and juicy.  The medium-rare steak was more like medium to well done.

The employees dancing about every 30 minutes is a neat attraction, but in the back of my head I&#39;m thinking how much work they could be getting done if they weren&#39;t dancing."

You can pull the meat off with a fork because it&#39;s so tender.  The bread and cinnamon butter is delicious and complimentary.  It is loud in here but it&#39;s a blast!  This place is always packed so wait times are long if you don&#39;t call ahead for seating.  The sides are good and the apps are good and the service is almost always great.  The last four times we&#39;ve come here a manager has come by to check on us.  How many other restaurants have that kind of personal service?  Sometimes, the servers are a hit or a miss.  However, our server last night, Tarah, was the best.  It was really busy but we never had to ask her for a refill- she was on top of everything.  
We come here for the ribs.  If you come here for anything else you might be disappointed.  I&#39;m not fond of the steak here...my ribeye was very thin and I could taste the gas it was cooked on.  The BBQ chicken is also delicious.
But, ribs.

We had to wait about 30 minutes which was completely fine considering it was prime time for dinner. While we waited my daughter spilled her water. I went &amp; asked one of the hostesses for a towel because my daughter had spilled. She gave me the dirtiest look ever, like I was putting her out. After about a minute &amp; a half she returned with a few cocktail napkins. She didn&#39;t ask where the spill was so she could clean it up but rather handed me the napkins &amp; went back behind the hostess station. I&#39;d like to mention that she wasn&#39;t the only hostess. There were 4 total. In my opinion, Sydney needs a refresher on how to be a hostess! If cleaning up spills is not in her job description then she should have asked a bus boy to clean it up. I have never been handed napkins to clean up a mess in a restaurant.

Highly recommend the ribeye and ribs combo you won&#39;t be disappointed. Our server Adam was friendly and provided a positive experience until I ordered drinks...not his fault. 

Was rather disappointed in the liquor selection though. No Jäger, no fireball, or Redbull. Perhaps management needs to realize these can be enjoyed with food and are not a sign that a bunch of 20 something&#39;s are going to be hanging out doing shots.

Pulled pork- dry and cold
Roasted chicken and ribs- over seasoned, dry and not very warm.

I was in my car while I called and could not write down their confirmation number...I assumed incorrectly that my name and record of calling on my cell would be good enough. Nope. They couldn&#39;t find it even though I gave my first name and my number, and requested a table and not a booth or high-top. So we waited another 20 minutes to be seated in the very, very loud dining room. They should offer to text or email the confirmation numbers in the future.

I feel the place doesn&#39;t know what they are. Peanuts on the floor all over, but serving steaks? It&#39;s just tacky. The sports bar look of the place, but then the poor employees have to stop and line dance every half hour - really weird to be honest and there is so much work for them to be doing, this show isn&#39;t necessary and can tell how forced it is. 

Our table had the onion blossom appetizer and that was good - same as many other restaurants. Two of us had New York strip steaks with baked potatoes and green beans, the other person had the country fried steak. The steaks were fine - cooked as ordered (medium and medium rare) but nothing amazing. No option for blue cheese on it! The green beans were truly disgusting - they were canned and total mush, filled with raunchy tasting bacon bits. If you&#39;re going to put a veggie on your menu say if it&#39;s processed to all hell and contains pork, I really just wanted some steamed green beans. The baked potatoes were definitely either a microwave job or cooked in the oven hours in advance and kept under a warming light or in a warming drawer because the skin was tough and you could just tell.

The country fried steak was good for about 10 minutes, then the gravy got too cold and mushy...the breading became pudding combined with the gravy and it was inedible after that. 

Our server and bus people were all very nice and capable, the one shining &#39;plus&#39; here. But I would not come back."

They must be going through some issues here as we were told none of the original kitchen staff were still with the company.

Two flavored lemonades were also ok, but overly sweet.

We almost walked out.
Not trying to be a jerk here, but it&#39;s a steak house, nearly everything on a steak house menu is naturally gluten-free.
It was extremely hard to get a straight answer about what to order that was gluten-free which tells me they just don&#39;t know.  Much more training is needed for everyone in this area!
The fries must have been the &#34;crispy coat&#34; fries (coated with flour for extra crispiness).
The steak seasoning contains flour (at least that&#39;s what I&#39;m figuring as, again, I couldn&#39;t get a straight answer even while talking with the acting KM.)
They make their seasoning mixes in house and must use flour with all of them as my wife ordered hers medium and without their typical seasoning and it was cooked WITHOUT ANYTHING--yes, that&#39;s right, no salt, no pepper, no granulated garlic--nothing, and it was pushing rare.  We sent it back.
Um...if you can&#39;t do the &#34;touch&#34; thing then use a thermometer--that&#39;s why they make them.
They should have 2 spice mixes in my opinion--one being gluten free...or at least add salt and pepper for GF requests.
I had mine medium and regular, but still had to add salt and pepper to it as it was under seasoned.  I was served medium rare, but kept it anyway as I can go either way with it.
Steamed vegetable medley...little or no seasoning on mine, my wife&#39;s was totally bland.
Caesar Salad, eh.
For dessert, two decafs and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.  Can&#39;t mess that up too much.  
Two stars for the potato skins and the efforts of the server and acting KM.
Food, not so much.
We won&#39;t be back.
Happy Eating!

I was excited to see what all the fuss was about, so we decided to visit for dinner on a Friday. 

Expecting it to be packed, I phoned in for the &#34;call-ahead seating..&#34; The first ten calls I made rang busy, so I was happy to finally get through. An automated system led me into the queue, with advertisements in lieu of hold music. After around ten minutes on hold, the recordings stopped, but my call timer indicated the call was still active, so I waited. After 35 minutes, I gave up.  When I called back, I got through immediately, so I&#39;m not sure what happened, but it was irritating, to say the least...

The hostess told me to arrive an hour and 45 minutes later, and so we did, at 7:45pm. We were given a buzzer, and still ended up waiting another 10-15 mins, munching on peanuts.

On our way to the table, our hostess grabbed a basket of rolls, which were delicious with the cinnamon butter spread. Since we had plenty of time waiting, we ordered right away. Draft beer, margarita, and &#34;cactus blossom&#34; appetizer.  The appetizer arrived before the drinks, so the server brought water instead.  The appetizer was undercooked, with the onions barely saftened, and uncooked batter in the center. The flavor was great, but it should have been cooked longer. Margarita was excellent!

We got an 11oz sirloin and a &#34;Roadkill&#34; chopped steak. The sirloin was cooked med-rare (instead of Med-well as ordered), so it had to be sent back. The chopped steak was very good, but the onion topping was too raw for my taste. The sides were just okay. Mashed potatoes came with brown gravy which needed salt &amp; pepper . The corn tasted old, like it had slightly dried out. The Caesar salad was ok, but could have used more dressing. Lastly, the cup of chili was average, but enjoyable--until I bit on a dime sized chunk of cartilage, which ruined it. 

I&#39;ll go back once more to give it another shot; perhaps after the opening rush has died down. It seems most of my complaints could be attributed to the mad rush of customers and staff being overwhelmed, taking shortcuts, etc. on the plus side, the service was outstanding, and the environment was fun and inviting."

Came here with a group of four. Service was good (at least I really liked the waiter) but it actually took a long time for the food to come out.  No one enjoyed the food. My burger was tasteless.

Had a family dinner there last night. Absolutely brutal. Only good thing was the fact our waitress was attentive. Everyone ordered steak and the only one who got the closest to what was ordered was my sister who only had to send it back 3 times. I ordered a steak medium rare and it came out so raw that I sent it back. So they made me another which came out cold. So I sent it back again and this time it came out raw so obviously I ask to speak with the manager( informed waitress she was doing an amazing job and it wasn&#39;t her fault), the manager waddled over to my table and basically tried to tell me that that is how a medium rare steak is supposed to look and that his cooks have done nothing wrong.so I asked for a box and said I will go home and cook it myself since your cooks can&#39;t figure it out. So he ends up comping our appetizer instead of actually doing anything about it. My stepmother ordered the green beans and you could tell that something wasn&#39;t right. Waitress and manager both claim that it was the ham and bacon that they cook them in but the smell was like chlorox cleaner and the taste I&#39;m not even sure how to describe it.all I know is I ate some and have spent the entire night in the bathroom I have eaten at other Texas Roadhouse restaurants and have never had this problem with the food or anything. Will definitely not be returning to this location and possibly done with the whole Texas Roadhouse chain after this experience."

The food was average. Cuts of meat could be better. 

Overall okay. Just okay."

They just opened so they were slammed on a Monday night. Wait times were short which was nice. The building used to be a TGIFridays and what a difference they made. Its very nicely redone with lots of booth and table seating and huge wrap around bar with tons of TV&#39;s. I see this place giving buffalo wild wings a run for their money. 

On that note, this is particularly why I didn&#39;t enjoy it to the fullest. I don&#39;t like Bdubs and I certainly not a fan of sports bars usually because they are over crowded and are loud, two things that I try and avoid when I go out to eat. 

The food was alright. It&#39;s a little pricey but the portions are made to match so you don&#39;t feel the sting so bad. We saw the steaks and fresh bread pointed out to us by our host as we went to the table.Our meals were okay, I had the roasted chicken which was not was I was expecting, but good nonetheless.   My inlaws, and husband all got steaks with mushrooms and onions on top, which were too salty and they did not eat them. The manager was super kind and understanding though, and helped my in laws with some meal passes to come back and eat on their own. 

If you like having the entire restaurant know its your birthday they&#39;ve got someone who can seriously yell. There had to be at least 6 birthdays while we were there. They remind me of applebees the way they announce your name and age to the entire venue and continue to clap, dance and sing. Speaking of clapping, dancing and singing this place also plays a country song once every hour to which the staff is trained to dance. You really must enjoy dancing if you work here.

The overall experience was loud, happening, and very interactive.  Our server Sara was AMAZING. Friendly, very personable, accommodating, and welcoming. THe only thing we can&#39;t get over is how they were dancing while we were eating, and my husband dropped his knife on the floor. The server dances by, picks it up, smiles at him, and dances away, but never brought a new one! He was mid meal! He had to use mine to finish. Hahaha, we thought that was funny. This would not be my first choice to return to, however if that&#39;s what the group wants I know I can find someone I&#39;ll enjoy if I go. 

Also, perhaps unrelated note I did eat around 7:30pm and this morning at 4am I was in the bathroom for a Roadhouse size upset stomach. I&#39;m not 100% positive if it was the food or if my body is not feeling well by my Caesar salad came right back up. So sad :("

We stopped in on a Sunday evening and aside to the pre-occupied hostess we were treated gracious by a server that took us to our table for 2. Upon sitting we were served there hot rolls and house cinnamon butter which I like. Our server Erick could not have been nicer. I advised him right off that we were not in a hurry and wanted a relaxing dinner. He took our drink order and suggested a few appetizers, allowed us plenty of time to chose. Once we decided on the onion blossom and enjoyed it he came to check on us and was not pushy to take our food order. Once we were ready to order he could not have been more accommodating for us. My wife is kind of picky when it comes to dining out and asked a lot of questions which he took time to answer without being rushed. Once the order was finalized and our food was served there was no mistake that he listened. Everything was cooked and served as asked. Would I go back? Yes ....."

My wife and I stopped by Saturday evening and the restaurant was quite crowded. After a short wait we were seated - service was pretty spotty and the staff seemed very busy. When our food came I noticed one of the side orders was incorrect but the servers were rushing around so fast I didn&#39;t have a chance to comment. I also would have liked some A-! but no one stopped to see if our order was OK or if we needed anything. A little while later the manager stopped by (he was checking all the tables) and I relayed my complaints. He apologized and brought me some A-1 which I appreciated, even though I was half finished with my meal. When the bill came the upcharge for the side I ordered (but didn&#39;t get) was there. All in all a little disappointing and next time I&#39;d head across the street to Outback and see if the service and experience is a little better."

Unfortunately it was way more disappointing than my first visit. First time I went I had the ribeye and sangria both of which were amazing.! And the service was great, they don&#39;t take reservations but you can call ahead. This time we called ahead and still had to wait 20 minutes, not to mention our server sucked. This time I had sirloin, which was over cooked. The food was mediocre at best, waited an hour for our food. Needless to say I probably wouldn&#39;t bring my daughter again, it&#39;s just too hard to keep them entertained for a 2-3 hour dinner. Overall it was disappointing.!"

Three of us came here for drinks and dinner. There is no appetizers that stick out. Fried pickles I think were pre frozen.

If you like margarita mix for over 10 dollars, something called texas chilli taste like it came out of a can, frozen salad that was dry and tasteless. Then you might enjoy this place. Also They don&#39;t have medium rare prime rib only medium and its cold. Thank the stars the ajus was warm. I know its Chicago area in November, but serve frozen salad and cold prime rib please. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer on me but it was cold to the touch.
You have to feel sorry for the wait staff, they have shirts that say they love their job. They did not look like they were enjoying themselves the night we were there.

Very disappointed, the one in Rockford at least can make a medium rare prime rib and serve it warm."

We were informed they only had 3 tables that could hold a party of 8. We only had about a 10-15 minute wait. Our table consisted of a long booth with a table put on the end with 2 additional chairs. 
3 of us ordered Prime Rib Medium Rare. Our waitress informed us they were out of medium rare prime rib. We could get Medium, Medium well, or well done. Who runs out of medium rare prime rib at 4:30-5pm on a Saturday? I changed mine to a Porterhouse/T-bone which was pretty good. The 2 others who ordered the prime rib their cuts were VERY fatty. 
By the time we left about 6pm - all 3 tables that could hold a party of 8 were filled with tables on the end with 2 chairs. So it was difficult for servers, and patrons to get by in the isle. As we left all the booths along the bar all had chairs at the end of the tables to accommodate parties of 5 or 6.  Again difficult for  servers, and patrons to get by in the isle. As we approached the front the waiting area was over flowing &amp; there was little room to move or get by to get out the front door.
Mix drinks are weak &amp; expensive, ie a tall Jack &amp; Coke $6.47. Food was good but not wowing. 
If you want a GOOD steak dinner with place that can easily handle a party of 5 or more go next door to the Village Squire!  The food is a lot better, your less cramped, drinks are stronger and reasonably priced.

I loved the atmosphere and the theme. The rolls were awesome and the dancing was great. Our server was nice. The blooming onion was the best I have ever had. I ordered their ribeye. Before ordering, I asked the server how big it was. He showed us with his hands (13 inches long). I thought to myself that that was amazing. When I got it, it was 13 inches, including the 4 inches on each side of fat, and it was overcooked. So really, the edible portion was 5 inches long, 2 inches wide when I was told it was wayyy bigger. We called the manager over and explained everything and he let me choose something else after a long discussion about how he thought it was ok. I chose the New York strip steak and a little while later got it. It looked like it was a different shape then the New York strip steaks they were displaying in their meat cooler but I assumed it was still the New York even though it tasted rougher than a New York. When we got our bill, we discover that I got a sirloin for the replacement (a much cheaper steak), and I was pretty mad.

You mislead me about the size of my steak and overcooked it the first time, and you don&#39;t even give me the steak I want as a replacement. Good job guys! :)"

We were here on a Saturday for lunch and we were seated in a booth directly across from the bar and the computer system where employees enter tickets. The whole time all of the employees just hung out here just a few feet away, it got really distracting. They were also hanging out in a booth directly behind us (2 booths away). The whole vibe was weird because we constantly had a crowd of people by us. My husband used the bathroom and said there was a server crying by the bathroom talking to another server going on about how some guy is an a-hole. Really? Leave the drama at home. 

Maybe it was because there wasn&#39;t a lot of patrons and they weren&#39;t busy but have the employees socialize elsewhere."

I&#39;ve heard really good things about this place so I figured it would be a good time to try it.  The place is pretty big inside and it fills up fast.  Once you&#39;re seated they serve you rolls for the table which are delish.  You can also grab free peanuts and eat them while you wait to be seated or once you&#39;re seated.  We started with an appetizer of the onion, which was pretty good.  Most entrees come with sides so there is plenty to eat. 
I ordered salmon which was pretty tasty, but it was full of bones.  For  the small piece of fish I had, I couldn&#39;t believe how many bones there were.  After dinner we got a piece of cheesecake, which was so small, it was funny.  The bill was under $100 for 4 adults to eat.

we came in for the first time today (like 3 hours ago) after debating between this and Outback, since we had never been, we chose here. We got the rolls, which were fantastic with the butter! Unfortunately everything went down hill after that. We got a full slab of ribs, fried pickles, cactus blossom, bacon cheese burger, cheese fries, chili and a caesar salad, some of these were sides for the big items.
The cheese fries and chili were ok.
The ribs and caesar salad were good but nothing fantastic, the ribs were fall off the bone, literally, but the meat wasn&#39;t overly flavorful and the barbecue sauce was just eh, something I could buy at Jewel for like $2. 
The cactus blossom and the fries were personally gross for me, some type of seasoning in the breading was just gross, and I couldn&#39;t stomach it so I just stopped eating them.
And the burger was ok, but too salty for me, I can say they cooked it perfectly though!
The service was ok in some spots, good in others, and great in one.
It was ok in the front, the hostesses looked put out when we came in, because god forbid we interrupt their texting and gossiping.
Our waitress talked... a lot, but she was friendly and wanted to help in any way, which is good customer service in my opinion.
As for the other workers, some were just blank faced, at least ours was smiling, but there was one fantastic server, who I wish we had, he was smiling, friendly, very perky, and even lead the line dance happily.
So all in all it was ok, with 2 shining moments. I&#39;d give 2.5 stars, but I don&#39;t want to give the full 3."

The waiting area was crowded but groups seemed to be getting tables fairly regularly while we were waiting for our food.

The only plus I can say are for the hot rolls with cinnamon butter and a delicious sweet potato. 
We ordered rib eyes cooked medium. My son&#39;s was well done, shriveled up and char black on one end. Needless to say, we sent it back. He sat there while we ate ours, and we would share bites with him when he would let us. Granted, rib eye&#39;s are marbleized cuts, but they were just a little too fatty for our liking. They brought grilled onions when we asked for mushrooms, had to bring out green beans that they had forgotten. By the time my son&#39;s new steak came out, it was not as well done, but not medium either. He still had grissel to cut around. He had a cup of chili that he said was tasty, but like I said the second steak was just ok.   They did take his meal off our bill without us asking, but it still ran us $132.00 before tip for a party of 5, again after deleting his cost for the steak. Sorry, don&#39;t think I will be back anytime soon. Atmosphere is loud, bar like, the waiter cannot even hear us when we were ordering. My mother in law just recalled she never got one of her side orders as well!"

She really seemed like an experienced server and it showed. It really was the best service we&#39;ve had so far. My steak was slightly undercooked, but not enough that I wouldn&#39;t eat it.

The pulled pork came out and right away I knew something was wrong because it was jiggling.  I immediately pulled out a 3 inch long piece of fat. The &#34;pulled pork&#34; was at least 75% jiggling fat pieces. I&#39;ve never seen anything like that.  It was absolutely disgusting.  I asked the waiter to please send it back and he did very nicely. While he was gone I tried my salad which was made from frozen lettuce that was ROTTEN. I was so grossed out and frustrated.  When he brought out a &#34;new&#34; pulled pork dinner it was literally the same plate as before except they chopped the fat pieces a little smaller and now they were ice cold. It was appalling. All the employees stand around talking.  Everything is sticky.  The food is disgusting and very old. I&#39;ll never go again.

The man who took my order didn&#39;t make a great first impression, but based on the positive reviews, I was still excited for lunch!  I ordered tacos and a side of chips and guacamole.  The tacos were excellent.  I ordered 3 steak with onions and cilantro.  I wasn&#39;t asked what kind of salsa I wanted, but was told it was in the bag.  In the bag I found 1 red and 1 green.  I don&#39;t use red, so that was a waste, but I would have liked another green.  Extra salsa can be purchased for $0.25.  I wasn&#39;t given any lime for my taco and I was honestly too afraid to ask  - this guy was not having a good day and I didn&#39;t want to make him angry!

Now the chips and guac -- both are good.  The guac is a little onion heavy, but I love onion, so no bother there.  The portion, however, is silly.  They serve a large Styrofoam clam-shell of chips -- enough for 2+ people to share, and a tiny two-ounce portion of guacamole -- for $4.25!  I don&#39;t mind paying for guacamole - avocados are expensive, I get it, but this was just silly.  What do I do with all these chips?"

The margaritas are extremely watered down and the lime mix used taste terrible.

The food is bland with no flavor and they cheat on the filling in the enchiladas, burritos and tacos (hardly any main ingredients).

If you want a hole in the wall go to El Farro in Dundee.  If you want a little more upscale, go to the Cactus Zone or El Molino.

The interior is kind of interesting: rustic, industrial, casual. The tables are pretty large - maybe a bit awkward but then again I&#39;m pretty tiny so perhaps they are normal sized LOL.

The starter salsa and chips were tasty. The salsa had a kick on the end of it, so by the time my food came, I was grateful to douse the fire that had grown in my mouth. Yummy though! 

I had the fish taco (dinner) in flour tortillas w/ beans and rice. The fish tacos were delish! Very fresh and flavourful. Would definitely order them again!!! The re-fried beans were more re-fried than beans, but they grew on me. I&#39;m looking forward to try some tostadas or a burrito next time!

They had the 99 cent taco Tuesday special sign out by the road so I thought I would give them a try. I tried some chicken and some beef. The beef was completely bland and dry with zero flavor, and I&#39;m not super picky when it comes to taste. As long as its pretty good I am happy, I would have rather had plain toast than these. The chicken was just okay...was like prime rib compared to the beef at least. But the worst part was how small they were. I was shocked. The taco&#39;s were almost completely empty! Not just almost no meat but no cheese or  tomatoes. They even skimped on the lettuce! Basically just tiny tortillas with a bit of filling on the very very bottom. 

As I was waiting for my order I was reading over some of their daily specials and was looking forward to giving them a try in the near future, as they seemed very reasonable. No point in ever going back now. What is the point of paying a lower price for almost nothing?? Ridiculous, I will stick to El Faro."

We moved to West Dundee back in 2003.  We LOVE Mexican food!!!  We first tried this place back in 2003 and were completely disappointed...the food was somewhat tasteless and very dry.
About a year later we decided to give it another try.  Although we ordered different meals than the year prior (it was so bad that we remembered what we ordered) the food remained on par with our previous experience.  It was edible...that&#39;s all.
Now, it&#39;s 2011 and we still live here.  We live in the neighborhood right across Huntley Road so it&#39;s very convenient.  It was Cinco de Mayo so we thought we&#39;d give it one last try after 7 years to see if anything changed.  Shame on us.  
I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga dinner.  Right off the bat my chimi looked terrible.  It had no real shape to it and appeared to be a bit soggy.  And it was.  I touched it with my fork and there was not one bit of it that was crispy in the least.  It had the consistency of a wet leather moccasin.  I took a bite and that was the end of it.
I then turned to the re-fried beans.  I am not exaggerating when I tell you they are gray in color.  It was very unappetizing yet since my main course was off the table I gave the beans a try.  I mixed in a little of the rice and some green sauce and except for the awful color they were OK.
My wife ordered the chicken flautas and was equally disappointed with her entire meal.  She was less adventurous with the beans though.
Now I know when I personally read 4 and 5 star reviews and then see one bad review (mine) I typically overlook that bad one as I presume the reviewer either just got unlucky or has a bone to pick with the establishment.  I assure you neither of those applies to my review as we have tried this place 3 times and I waited 8 years to finally review it.  If you do disregard my review (which I admitted I probably would considering the other reviews) I wish you good luck.
Note* In the past 8 years we have consistently received excellent food from ON the Border (over on Randall).  And as someone mentioned the Fish Tacos at this place I assert there is NO WAY they are better than On the Border&#39;s Dos Equis Fish Tacos!!!  That I promise."

I almost always order the pan fried noodles with vegetables and fried tofu (extra $2). It is always fantastic. I&#39;ve never had spoiled tofu here. And unlike some restaurants where most of the veggies are canned (ugh Lao Hunan), the veggies are always fresh. They use a slightly different mix than the usual, which often includes white button mushrooms, tomatoes, bell peppers, bean sprouts, and snap peas. 

The soups are super hearty (see pics) and cheap at a little over $2. They have $3 cocktails and wine on offer. Try the plum wine if you like sweet wines.

Crab ragoon
Crispy chow fun noodles w/the green veggies and shrimp
Chef&#39;s special shrimp and scallops
Chicken &amp; beef curry
Plain white rice
Fried rice

The chow fun noodles I&#39;ve never tried cripsy before and the were pretty good.

The Chef&#39;s special was delicious and came out overflowing the plate (by the way they have big portions)

The chicken curry dish was too soupy for me. It wasn&#39;t exactly how I expected curry to be. It looks and tastes more like gravy and it&#39;s not thanksgiving so I didn&#39;t enjoy that too much.

The crag ragoon comes out extra crispy (6 big ones) and none to little cream cheese filling which I APPRECIATE because I actually don&#39;t like my crag ragoon all creamy and fatty. Their crab ragoon appetizer here is filled with I believe is real crab meat.

The fried rice I enjoyed because it came with little beef cube chunks I believe and it didn&#39;t taste overly seasoned or salty. None of the food did which I thought was great.

Will I come back here again? Yes!!

For a party of 3 adults and 2 younger children our bill was only $40? I say that&#39;s money well spent. We left home with left overs too which was great."

I recommend the egg-drop soup (it&#39;s more broth-y than many eggdrops -- they don&#39;t use any or as much corn starch), wonton soup, Liu&#39;s Special with Chow Fun, Schezwan Chicken with Chow Fun, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce with Chow Fun and Sweet and Sour Chicken with fried rice."

I wish I could still eat here twice a week like I used to.

The decor here couldn&#39;t get more basic.. it looks like the restaurant hasn&#39;t been updated much in 20 years and won&#39;t impress anyone.  But I&#39;d go just about anywhere for food like this.  Both the food and the owner&#39;s smile are truly memorable and you just can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu.

I mean really, REALLY good. Like drive out of your way because you&#39;ve got a taste for burnt ends and no other restaurant will taste the same good. 

The burnt ends are a must-have every time I go. I&#39;m usually not a fan of sweeter pickles but they just taste right with the balsamic-BBQ glazed brisket ends. So damn delicious. I&#39;m also a big fan of the BBQ Nachos. In fact, I could make a meal out of just appetizers here. 

Anything from the smoker is great. I&#39;ve had the ribs, honey-brined chicken, pulled pork, and hot links from the smoker. Shout out for having crispy, salty tater tots as a potato option! Yes!!

I recently made what I thought in my mind was a very brave decision to veer away from the smoked meats and appetizers and order something from the entrees section of the menu. I tried the chicken and grits. In very few words, it was amazing. High five to the chef who decided to use thighs for this dish. They were perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. The sriracha-honey drizzle on top was the perfect finishing touch. For such a heavy-sounding dish (fried chicken thighs on top of cheese grits) it is surprisingly well-rounded. So damn good. Like I&#39;ll probably order it every time I go and just sneak bites of BBQ from my tablemates. The portion is more than enough to eat half and bring the rest home for lunch the next day (or a midnight snack).

The only thing I&#39;ve had that I could probably pass on the next time is the chicken wings. The combination of smoke and buffalo was just a little too much for me, and they were a little too salty. That doesn&#39;t take away any desire to come back though! I&#39;m glad I tried them, I&#39;ll just choose something else next time!

....great, now I&#39;m craving."

Staying overnight before flying out of o&#39;hare, we were frankly kind of unexcited about dinner options nearby. Hmm, take our chances with strip mall Thai or Mexican food (before an international flight seems risky...), go to one of the gazillion chain restaurants nearby, order delivery pizza, or take our chances on a place that says it has great ribs &amp; BBQ. We took our chances and don&#39;t regret it. 

Spacious place, no wait at 6pm on a weeknight, a terrific selection of whiskey, bourbon, cocktails, beer, and moonshine, and friendly service were a nice opener. 

The husband had the BBQ combo with Texas hot links &amp; pulled pork - both were delicious, though his baked potato was lackluster. I had the grilled chicken Sammie which was super yum - perfectly cooked &amp; seasoned chicken, lots of caramelized onions, on a tasty roll. And - best part! - it came with fries or (duh) tater tots. These were some high quality tater tots. (and I&#39;m a bit of an expert...) 

We shoulda passed on the meh chips &amp; salsa &amp; Guac appetizer (though the salsa was fresh &amp; flavorable and the Guac was fine), but my side salad was a cut above the usual iceberg side salad, with mixed greens, chopped cucumbers, tomatoes &amp; huge tasty croutons. 

Did I mention the whiskey &amp; cocktails? We may have each had one. 

Super tasty, good service, very reasonably priced, and if you can ignore the TVs everywhere, it&#39;s great. We&#39;d definitely go there again."

One of the things I like about this place is it&#39;s a big building, but it&#39;s not a big, single room restaurant.  They&#39;ve separated the eating areas into smaller, more intimate rooms (2 with a shared fireplace) and also a good sized outdoor patio with a fireplace.

In all the times I&#39;ve been there I&#39;ve never stopped into the bar area.  So when my friend was celebrating his birthday we went there for beers.  The place was lively, the service was good and friendly and the beers were nice and cold.

Once at the bar, then a high top, and then an actual table in the dining back area. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I have received the slowest service compared to any other restaurant all with a different server each time. The restaurant isn&#39;t even busy! It&#39;s just a quarter full with empty tables everywhere. I just don&#39;t get it. I&#39;m fairly confident that they hire waitstaff with no prior experience.

The food is good, they have a good drink selection and craft beers. Their moonshine drinks are meh. Not as strong as you would hope/want. We had the burnt ends - so good! And the nachos and southwest wrap is yummy. So the few stars in giving you go to food, but sorry, the service has outweighed the food...

But I can&#39;t stand my dinner being extended by an extra hour and a half because you don&#39;t know how to train your staff. Last night when I came here, we ended up getting our appetizer out BEFORE we still had even ordered our entrees with menus lying around everywhere. Just to give you an idea of how attentive the staff was... I can see servers easing up once you get your food... But having to wait 30 mins to order isn&#39;t cool. 

You would think the waitress would ask us for our food order immediately when dropping the appetizer off and realizing that she probably has slacked a little...But didn&#39;t and kept up her consistency with darting away before we can even ask her for anything. Probably tending to her other two tables she servicing, ya know... Because she&#39;s so busy. It was funny because when she got back she said, &#34;So, are you ready to order yet?&#34; YES, like five years ago! Seriously?!

Also, half the table never got waters... Probably cuz she forgot to bring the rest out? There was five of us.... We had to follow up another two times for them. Also because of the service, don&#39;t expect refills on drinks either - alcoholic or not. 

Sorry Rack, I&#39;m all about second chances, sometimes thirds... But you&#39;ve officially lost my business."

I take the same approach with restaurants. There&#39;s so many variables when it comes to restaurant different servers, different nights, busy one day more than others, and just in general different managers.so you hold that it&#39;s always a good experience this time but you never know.

I&#39;ve been to the Rack more than a few times. And each time the whole meal as a whole was never that great. The ribs will be good with the chicken wasn&#39;t fully cooked. Or the meatloaf which is fantastic by the way was good but then they would not put enough sauce on top of it. I could say I never had a fulfilling experience there.

So tonight when we went my expectations were low. The service was decent. She was not very attentive and then do a good job like bringing up the drinks or refill on the drinks. I got the combination of ribs and brisket. I&#39;ve gotten the ribs before and I didn&#39;t think they were that great at all. I thought I could a got better at the grocery store in the pre-cook section. This time when they came out for the combination meal I wasn&#39;t expecting to have to a half rack but three pieces of ribs is just sub par. Factor in it was way over cook and I thought I was eating Jack Links jerkey. The difference being Jacks is chewy and this was was just el carbon. The brisket wasn&#39;t great either. Not terrible. Serviceable. I would say it would be awesome at a high school lunch. 

I tried my friends Carolina Pulled Pork. Yup over cooked. Spinach? Salt and butter. Looked delicious. Too much salt. Actually more than a few people said it was a very salty meal."

Prices aren&#39;t very high for barbeque but not a bargain -- decent sized portions. Service is friendly, but could be a little faster. The food is mostly unmemorable -- the textures are acceptable, the flavors aren&#39;t perfect but nothing is unpleasant, the theme of the dishes isn&#39;t obvious but there seems to be some care put into the preparation.

The best item I tried on my trip was the brisket -- tender and tasty and in hearty slices. The smoked sausage was also very flavorful, with a bit of a kick -- although I didn&#39;t love the flavorings that were used. The BBQ chicken, pulled pork, and baby back ribs failed to leave much of an impression. Each could&#39;ve been more moist, but they weren&#39;t terribly overcooked either -- possibly an extra bit of marination instead of depending on the barbeque sauce for flavor could&#39;ve been an improvement.

The sides were alright as well -- the corn bread has a strong flavor of corn, but is a bit on the dry side. The baked beans had a good texture and flavor, like a sweet chili. The coleslaw was also flavorful, but could&#39;ve been a little more creamy.

Rack House does seem to have promise, as the ingredient quality and smoke flavor is in the food -- a little refinement on cooking times and flavor would easily bump them up to 4 or 5 stars."

Conveniently, Rack House is a little over a mile from my home. 

We sat down and we started with an order of cheese curds. The cheese curds came out piping hot and delicious! The chili aioli really made the cheese curds POP! Unsure how others can label them as &#34;bland&#34;. 

Our server was very nice, considering we came in about an hour to close. He recommended an excellent craft brew. We both thoroughly enjoyed the recommendation. 

Next, we both ordered the Beef Brisket / Quarter Baby Back Ribs combo. It came with Jalapeño coleslaw, a baked potato, and AMAZING honey butter cornbread. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the Jalapeño cornbread. 

The ribs were excellent, the meat fell right off the bone. The brisket was delicious, with a persistent smoky flavor to it. The ribs and brisket were coated in a light &#34;glaze&#34; of barbecue sauce. However, I must say the meats needed a bit more sauce on them. Regardless, the barbecue was excellent, especially living in Chicago. 

We will certainly be back when the craving for barbecue hits!"

For the next six months we had tried to get out to this place with no success... And finally we made it. In a word, wow.

For starters, Brandon was our server and he was absolutely on top of everything. Super nice guy with great recommendations and extremely prompt service. When he had given us our appetizer of the burnt ends he asked how it was. I was genuinely giving constructive criticism in saying that it was a little bit fatty for my tastes, when a manager was walking by had asked me to repeat myself and ended up comping that appetizer. We didn&#39;t expected but I will be honest that it was actually really nice of them.

My girlfriend and I then went for the full rack of ribs. At $26 it is a steal and let me tell you it was one of the best racks of ribs I&#39;ve had in a very long time. The meet was so fall off the bone that it literally fell off the bone one my girlfriend picked up one of the reps. In a word I would describe it as succulent. It&#39;s a must get if you go there. Additionally, the cornbread that came with the meal was remarkable. It had those little pieces of corn in it which burst with flavor and was Don just... Very well.

Finally, on the side we had macaroni and cheese. Our waiter told us that it was their new recipe for macaroni and cheese and it is a winner. The cheese was nice and creamy macaroni was fresh and cooked to perfection where it was not too hard are not too soft.

All in all, this was a pretty epic place. I was extremely satisfied and we are definitely going back. The total bill was $36 which is nothing short of an absolute steal. If this was in the city and had the name Webbers it could sell for three times the price only in this case it would be twice is good. Put it this way... It&#39;s good enough that if you live in the city, go there. It&#39;s worth the trip."

It has a warm, inviting atmosphere, and really good weekly deals (check out their website). Not to mention the beer list! I had no idea this place had an extensive beer list. Almost all of the beers they have I had never tried. Our server was great about getting us samples and making recommendations.

In speaking of service, our server was great. The entire night he was very attentive, explained the menu, and even gave us a free dessert! The service is what really put this restaurant over the top.

The food was really good too. They have a variety of different things to try. I decided on the combo BBQ platter with pulled pork and brisket. The portions are just right, and they have great sides to choose from. It wasn&#39;t too pricey either (not cheap, but not crazy expensive). Good comfort food!

This was much appreciated, and allowed us to learn that youn can split the 8 piece order of wings into 2 flavor options, and he told us his favourite options for the trifecta plate wich was a great way to try and split 3 meats between two people.

First up,  it&#39;s a very easy location to get to.  Parking is ample.  The hostess though different on the days I went,  on both days was very pleasant and seated me promptly. The servers were quick and accommodating.  I was by myself but they still checked on me multiple times; always appreciate that. When asked,  they gave me recommendations on popular drinks and dinners. 

First time here I got the Carolina pulled pork plate. Second time I got the over easy burger/egg. Both were delicious. Good portion sizes here.

We were out in the &#39;burbs with the grandkids anyway, so why not try it? 

We were very pleased! Chef Bryant had a special of his Chicken and Cheesy Grits which is soooooooooooooooo good. Then my husband tried a new special of steak and shrimp with a saucy topping. He loved it so much he ate the whole thing. Sorry I can&#39;t describe the sauce for you - it looked slightly BBQ-ish - but I didn&#39;t get a bite!

The staff took great care of our pair of 4-year-old boys, not an easy task what with a spilled drink and such. Turned out the boys loved the BBQ brisket more than the their own chicken tenders. They also liked the cheesy grits and the broccoli!

The gooey chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top sounded like an ordinary combination, but something about it made it much better than others we&#39;ve had. We thought we were sharing  the dessert with all three generations, but the grandsons moved onto grandpa&#39;s lap and the three of them ate the whole thing themselves :)

Rack House is huge compared to Cafe Selmarie but it&#39;s built in smaller sections so it felt &#34;warmer&#34; rather than industrial. The section we sat in could seat about 70 people and it was well-staffed in that we always had service as soon as we needed it. I would suggest to the restaurant that having the list of specials on the table while we decided what to order would be more helpful than having the waiter read it to us after we&#39;d been perusing the menu. That made ordering a 2-step process because we switched to ordering the specials once we heard them. 

One memory our grandson repeats over and over - the waiter brought him THREE cherries on a plastic &#34;sword&#34;. We knew Chef Bryan&#39;ts food had that extra step of caring and with the staff taking extra care as well, we&#39;ll be going back again."

I called and asked if they sing happy birthday. I was told they do, I decided to go here and celebrate husband&#39;s birthday. But when we got a dessert with candle, nothing but a just plain handover. 
I was disappointed.
Moreover, the server was nice and paid for one beer for my husband as a bday treat. I had beef brisket. It was good. My husband got a rib eye, he asked for medium reddish but got an overcooked and dry steak. I likes their corn bread.
Overall, it&#39;s fine. But not sure if coming back."

On Thursdays they have $5 burgers. Add a couple bucks for toppings and you are set. They use really good meat, know how to cook it right, and are simply awesome. They even taste smokey. Almost like you actually hired a professional chef who uses fresh food to grill at ur own BBQ. 

As for their BBQ, amazing again. I&#39;ve had the ribs, the brisket, and the pork. All of it was melt in your mouth good. Perfectly smoked everything. I would almost say this food is as good as and possibly better than smoque in the city. 

Honestly, everything I put in my mouth here is awesome. I usually hate The side of coleslaw all restaurants and give. But this place really pays attention to how it&#39;s made. I have never liked coleslaw until I&#39;ve tried it here. And the cornbread is also ridiculous. Mashed potatoes yes. Tater tots yes. French fries yes.

And let&#39;s not get started on the moonshine. 

The only complaint I would give this place is that it costs between 18 and $25 for the barbecue platter. But in their defense, they do give a lot of food.

Tip: stay the hell away from the insanity sauce. One drop of it and I was sweating."

They skimped on the sauce: I expect my proteins to be either slathered in BBQ sauce or with generous portions on the side in containers; neither was the case.

*On top of that the 3 Trifecta proteins I ordered were pretty much devoid of BBQ/smoke flavor.  However, the meats were NOT dried out which I appreciated.

*This was a worst-case scenario for carryout: They didn&#39;t include any of the 3 extra sides I paid extra for, but I received 2 sides I didn&#39;t order nor want.  Granted it was a Saturday night and they were busy in both carryouts and table service.  If you&#39;re doing carryout be sure to open &amp; check all your items before you leave.

*The Burnt Ends appetizer is a standout! I&#39;m a Kansas City transplant so anytime I see Burnt Ends in the Chicago area I&#39;m intrigued.  These were good and served as an appetizer with generous amounts of good cole slaw and nice sour pickles.  

*The cornbread is good."

There are two things that are very consistent with Rack House: 1) The food is always really good, and 2) the service is always mediocre. I don&#39;t like being negative so I&#39;ll focus on the good stuff first.

The food is always excellent, which is what keeps bringing us back to Rack House. My brother loves the BBQ brisket sandwich, and there isn&#39;t anything I&#39;ve ordered that I didn&#39;t enjoy. The BBQ pulled pork sandwich is good, the salads are good (there is a tuna salad I really like), the soups are good, appetizers good, the tater tots (mmmm).... just very solid good food. Everything is a huge size portion, so the nice thing is you can have leftovers for later. There is a good variety on the menu so even if you don&#39;t like BBQ you can find something to eat. They also have a decent beer list as well. The patio in the back looks awesome (though my brother won&#39;t eat outside so I never get to sit out there).

The downside is that every time we go the service is bad. Having been a server for a long time, I&#39;m just surprised at the lack of even basic serving skills that these kids have. Over the last several visits we&#39;ve encountered a myriad problems ranging from being forgotten at the table, our orders not put in, our orders being wrong, servers disappearing for long swaths of time (to the point we have to ask the host to find our server), lack of knowledge regarding the menu, table numbers being entered wrong by multiple serving staff (as is evident from food runners stopping at multiple tables desperately trying to find where the food goes) or receiving general pithy behavior that borders on rudeness. The food is delivered to tables by runners, so I&#39;m not sure where the servers disappear for such long periods of time. The hosts, however, are always friendly and chipper. 

Look, I&#39;m not some picky needy person, and I really don&#39;t like leaving bad reviews. If you want good food and good beer go to Rack House, you won&#39;t be disappointed. It just surprises me that for as GOOD as the food is at Rack House, their service is consistently bad. There are always tables sat when we go, but I think they could really boom if the serving staff had better performance."

The service we receieved when we went in for a late dinner on Saturday night was great. Despite having both indoor and outdoor sections, our server was consistently checking in and tending to our needs. That&#39;s  pretty much where the rosy picture of Rack House ends...

Ordered: 2 sandwiches (BBQ Brisket &amp; Reuben)
Received: 4 thick slices of bread with BARELY any meat! The meat we did get was meh-countless small, fatty, pieces made up most of the brisket after I dug through the coleslaw and fried onions that seemed to make up a large part of the sandwich. The reuben, while drenched in a flavorful sauce, had an amount of meat that didn&#39;t even come close to what one would expect a typical reuben to have. I guess we failed to see the humor behind their deception in making these sandwiches &#34;appear&#34; to be more substantial.

For a bbq restaurant that specializes in several types of meat dishes, it was disappointing to not be able to actually taste much meat. The ratio of meat to bread was laughable, and after perusing some of the reviews on here, I know I&#39;m not the only one who has had the same unfortunate experience. For $12 sandwiches, we expected more. We deserved more.

The cherry on top? Took one last swig of my red wine, only to immediately spit it out. Nearly a tablespoon full of sediment at the bottom of my glass. Wtf.

It&#39;s a shame that the food and drink, the actual REASON people choose to go out to restaurants instead of cooking at home, is the only real thing lacking about this place. Outdoor patio, huge bar, and friendly servers are all fine and dandy, but I can find all that AND decent food elsewhere."

Pros: Solid beer selection and the BBQ sauce was super tasty.

The atmosphere/interior is quite nice! There is a few different seating areas including two bars and a secluded dining area. 

I was really worried about the food but it  turns out they have a few Gluten free items on the menu.  It&#39;s not just a bull **** offering either, which is usually apparent at places trying to jump on the bandwagon *cough Jason&#39;s deli cough*. This is always a good sign seeing as I have Celiac disease. The choices are all good but I&#39;ve only had the bourbon ribs and tortilla soup which were both surprisingly above average. 

The whiskey selection is also very good! This is a great place to go if you&#39;d like to try a bunch of different whiskey. Bulliet 10 year was a nice addition. They also have a sizeable craft beer list as well. 

Me and my friend have stopped by after work a few times and have had good experiences. Id definitely recommend this place for after work drinks/snacks. I don&#39;t know about setting out for a dinner with the wife...But maybe!"

The food is excellent. I tried a surf and turf special one evening, and the skirt steak was mouthwatering. The BBQ combo platter is also very tasty, especially the beef brisket. I also love the cornbread that comes with it!  I always enjoy the chef&#39;s specials, and last night one option was flank steak that came with beans and rice. Outstanding! I think it&#39;s great that they are branching out from their traditional menu and adding some interesting specials. And for a starter, the cheese curds are not to be missed. Very yummy!!

They have cider, which for me is a great option. The wine list is short, but has some good choices available. One evening margaritas were on special. Can&#39;t beat that!

The service has always been top-notch. One evening we had two four year olds with us, and our server could not have been more accomodating. I heartily recommend Rack House. It is comfortable, has great service, and I really love the food!"

Has a cool inviting atmosphere but it&#39;s also the kind of place I will forget exists and won&#39;t care to visit again, despite how close it is to me. Plain vanilla...
The service was just ok. The bartenders were not very personable and they just cleaned the bar 3 hrs before it was supposed to close. Kind makes you feel as if you should hurry up and finish your food and leave because you are being kicked out. Maybe they just can&#39;t stand the place either and want to go home. 
So I ordered chili and my husband ordered tortilla soup. He loved it, I just dealt with the chili because I was hungry. We ordered the caprese appetizer and the Mediterranean salad.  After eatinf the chili my expectations were low but the food was actually good. Other than the food, there was nothing great about this place. I am not sure I care to go again."

I&#39;m giving the restaurant two stars because I had a mostly pleasant experience when my husband and I dined in. The food is good.

However, things start to rapidly spiral downward when it comes to their online ordering system and catering.

Online ordering: Great in theory! However, I paid for dinner online and then my husband went to pick up the food. My husband accidentally paid again at the counter. The restaurant doesn&#39;t have a system in place to catch mistakes like this. Luckily, I noticed the double charge on our statement and through a series of several calls with employees and managers at the restaurant, finally got the second charge refunded. If you&#39;re going to offer online ordering and payment, you need to have checks in place that don&#39;t allow for the possibility of charging customers twice. Also, shouldn&#39;t the restaurant&#39;s books have been off at the end of the night? I&#39;ve worked in retail. If the money doesn&#39;t add up, you find out where the error is and correct it.

Catering: Buyer beware! I hosted a baby shower recently and decided to cater some food from The Rack House. I went online, selected the package and was ready to go. Until, I saw the total cost and realized it was about $50 more than it should be. (I did take into consideration taxes and I planned on picking up the order, so no delivery fee.) I called the restaurant and walked through my order with an employee. When we got to the checkout portion, she also saw the $50 overcharge and didn&#39;t know where it was coming from. She said she&#39;d get in touch with their website managers and get back to me. That was about a month ago and I have yet to hear back. Needless to say, I took my business elsewhere. If there&#39;s a good explanation for $50 tacked on to my order I&#39;m happy to hear it. Otherwise, it makes it look like the restaurant is hiding charges assuming the customer just won&#39;t notice.

Good food. Very disappointed in just about everything else."

Tables were mostly occupied by families that looked very comfortable and happy. I would not hesitate to invite my business clients as well - but probably stay inside. We experienced a small service failure that was quickly rectified proving that it is not a norm and restaurant is eager to assure that everyone is satisfied.

The cheese curds with the chili aioli dipping sauce are out of this world! I&#39;ve gotten them every visit here and quite honestly, they are the only reason I keep coming back. They also have an awesome outdoor patio which I high recommend on a nice day.

Now for the not so good...
I&#39;m not a fan of the atmosphere inside as it is dark and really doesn&#39;t have the décor you would expect of a BBQ joint. The food isn&#39;t all that great either. I&#39;ve tried the salmon, the brisket, and several of their burgers (which in my opinion are your best/safest bet) all of which were nothing special. It seems every visit to The Rack House involves some sort of issue. I&#39;ve had the bar not have my desired beer several times, numerous experiences where the service is extremely slow although the place wasn&#39;t busy, and have had mistakes with our order on a few occasions. 

I would still recommend the Rack House for their cheese curds are honestly worth it for me. Don&#39;t expect much more though."

First I was double I.D.&#39;d by our waitress and by the manager.  We ordered the nacho appetizer and our entrees at the same time as we knew what we wanted.  Even though I was starving I didn&#39;t expect them to bring out the nachos at the same time as my entree.  It just doesn&#39;t make any sense.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and the meat was really dry and very stringy.

This wasn&#39;t the best experience and I&#39;m not sure that I would come back here for barbecue."

The first time I came here I ordered a side of mac &amp; cheese with an appetizer: fried pickles and sweet corn. The mac &amp; cheese was not bad but not amazing. A unique thing was that they added crumbled corn muffin on top. The fried pickles and sweet corn were bland, which made the greasiness stand out (greasy is expected, but these were GREASY). I couldn&#39;t finish them; I guess this is why appetizers are meant for sharing. 

The second time I came here I got the steak tacos. Where the appetizers from last time lacked taste, these tacos had too much; they were extremely salty. And there was only two, which meant I not only didn&#39;t have leftovers, I actually thought about ordering another entree because I wasn&#39;t full yet. 

I did end up getting the cookie sizzler for dessert. The sizzler was small (I had no problem eating the entire thing on my own), and it got so soggy from the melting ice cream by the end, I couldn&#39;t finish the last bite. The first few bites were pretty good. It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve had better dessert sizzlers elsewhere.

So is the food here worth the price? Personally, I&#39;m going with a no. If I&#39;m going to be paying over $10 for my food, it better be somewhat decent. I&#39;m not that picky of an eater, but this stuff does not meet my standards. I&#39;d rather pay a few bucks more somewhere else and get much better food.

I admit it may have just been the food I ordered that left a bad taste in my mouth (literally), but they shouldn&#39;t have items on the menu that they can&#39;t cook well. If I do go back to this place, I&#39;ll try a burger on a Thursday (it&#39;s the daily special), and I&#39;ll leave an updated review. My friends have said that the burgers were alright. However, at this point, I am not impressed with this place.

On top of the sub-par food, the service was also very slow. It felt like our waitress took half an hour to come back to our table each time. It didn&#39;t even look like it was a busy night! Plus she would totally forget about things she had agreed to bring us, and then she messed up on my friend&#39;s drink order and kept saying she swore she heard him order what she brought him (he didn&#39;t). I will say that she was very nice, but nice does not really make up for poor service.

One thing I do like about this place is the cute dining area they have outside. They have a nice fireplace, and when it gets dark, they put out candles in mason jars which adds to the cozy ambiance. They also have TVs so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s great if you want to catch a game during dinner. I would recommend this place for drinking in the outdoor dining area during the summer - and maybe for the daily specials when the prices are more reasonable. That&#39;s about it."

The playlist was...interesting...a mixture of pop and dance music. Were we in a BBQ restaurant or &#34;in da club&#34;? IMHO, they should have a playlist made up of country, rockabilly, and honky tonk styles of music.

However, our most recent experience (Sept. 17), was one that we still were experiencing the next morning, and not in a good way. I ordered the Over Easy burger, medium well and it came out over cooked and hard as a puck. My brother ordered the Trifecta (ribs, chicken and salmon), and the food was so dry and tasteless that he barely had 2 bites before he sent it back. The chicken was so bad that after chewing a bite, it turned into a dry paste in your mouth. The salmon was also horribly over cooked. It&#39;s almost as if each item was sitting under a heat lamp for a long time and just smothered in BBQ just before it was served. Finally, my friend had the sliced brisket sandwich and while it wasn&#39;t as bad as my brother&#39;s plate, it was still very dry.

Granted, by the time we ordered, it was after 8:00. But that doesn&#39;t mean we should be served food that isn&#39;t freshly prepared. And I promise you that none of the food was freshly prepared. Most, if not all of it, was put in a microwave to reheat it.
We spent over $100 that night, even with my brother&#39;s meal being taken off the check. We were prepared to chalk it up to a bad night by your cooks, until all 3 of us woke up the next morning with bad stomach cramps and diarrhea. The only things we shared were the Rack House Mega Nachos and the Cheese Curds, so either one of those dishes made us all sick, or everything coming out of that kitchen that night made us sick.

I generally don&#39;t put up reviews because if I don&#39;t like the food at a restaurant, I just don&#39;t go back.  But I contacted the restaurant to tell them of the issues we had and there has been no response whatsoever.  I think it&#39;s time to look for a new BBQ joint.  Any suggestions?"

The staff was very nice and the place seemed clean. The cheese curds are amazing and I might just order two of those and roll myself out next time I stop in for dinner. For my meal I ended up going with the grilled cheese and tomato soup as I just wasn&#39;t feeling a burger that day.

When it arrived, I was surprised, as I was expecting the bread to be a toasted baguette of some sort- but it was on two slices of toasted white bread instead. Whatever, not a big deal. However, the pork itself was pounded so incredibly thin and was inedible, because it was so dry. I ended up just taking the pork off and making a veggie sandwich.

The sandwich has just the right amount of BBQ sauce.  The restaurant provided extra sauce without being asked.  We both enjoyed our sandwich.

The food was good, drinks (beer and moonshines) were good too.  But after about 9pm the place cleared out pretty good.  We left at 10:30 and no one was there.  Food and drinks to be good is one thing but no one wants to hang out at a bar on a Saturday night when no one shows up.  Maybe downtown Arlington Heights competes with it.

Food:

Good, but nothing to write home about.

Staff:

Not nearly as attentive as I expected in this type of place, especially considering the lunch crowd is 97% business professionals.

Atmosphere:

It was a little bit nicer than your neighborhood chain restaurant.


On a good note, the food did come out quickly and the order was completely correct, even though it was for 6 people and included our office&#39;s own &#34;When Harry Met Sally,&#34; everything-on-the-side person.

Not a bad place for lunch overall."

The slab consisted of ten meaty bones. The dinner includes jalapeño spiced cole slaw, walnut flavored corn bread and a baked potato. The latter is their standard side and they charge a dollar to substitute. Other places include two sides of your choice with their rib dinners.

In a word the ribs were mediocre. They were fairly tasty but it was a precooked and reheated kind of taste. The majority of the ribs were of the soft, fall off the bone variety; so much so that you needed to use a knife and fork if you didn&#39;t want to handle the meat with your hands. However the meat near one end of the slab was a little tough and dry.

There was little smoky, barbecue flavor. Very mild, almost bland tasting. This style might be more appealing to others than to me.

The cole slaw and corn bread were very good, the baked potato fair. I ordered the potato &#34;loaded&#34;, but I didn&#39;t taste any onions or bacon bits. The carry out service was good."

 When my fiance and I went there the service was great,  loved the food and the drinks and especially loved the outside patio!  This was the 4 review part

It&#39;s lowered to a 2 now HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED with the special events /catering and the management.  I requested on Sunday night with the hostess to be called for party pricing,  room pictures etc because we were thinking about having our wedding rehearsal there  since we liked it so much  when we went.  She said no problem she will be back Monday.  Monday came and I received no call nor email I called at 715 Monday night and asked for a manager which the gentleman said he was and told him I really would like information asap since I&#39;m a planner and want to get this all done but still haven&#39;t received anything.  He told me she was gone for the day but assured me I would have something in the morning on Tuesday.  Well it&#39;s now coming on to 4pm and I have still have not received anything?! I&#39;m very disappointed by the customer service and to top it off when I called back today and yesterday no one even apologized.  

Because of this we will not have our wedding reception here and I have no interest in returning to an establishment that handles businesses this way . What a shame!"

The host/manager who was clearly arguing upon our arrival of whom to seat where. As we walked passed a couple of open tables on the first floor, we were then sat up stairs. We had a server whom name I forgot who was very delightful and full of answers to all of our food questions. As she was getting the drinks for the table, someone who appeared to be the manger tugged on her arm and rudely asked her what she was doing. Our server did walk away for a minute but came back immediately to take the rest of our order. I found it mind boggling and a little embarrassing for upper management to act like this. I went to get up and look for the restroom, while searching, I peaked my head inside what I believe to be an area for servers only. I asked where the restroom was and saw these two women screaming at each other. To my surprise it was the same two women up front . Get it together ladies. All of that screaming was unnecessary for customers just wanting to enjoy their lunch. Our server made our experience wonder and that is the only reason we would be back !"

I will make sure they &#34;take their time&#34;. Until you get the food home and the sandwich is cold and soggy. Obviously they didn&#39;t take their time. Add to the fact they upped my order from a sandwich to a platter and you can see the incredible service they provide. 
Now for the food. The bacon was tasty. Everything else was bland, cold, and soggy. The soup was pretty tasty but it only diverted my attention from the rest of the meal briefly.
So if you are trying to get tasty food that&#39;s well prepared for your sick girlfriend, then find anywhere else. I hear the gas station has good sushi(kidding, no need to kill yourself). 
I would not go back here for any meal of the day. If you want to try out their other menu options maybe dining there would be best. Good luck."

It wasn&#39;t bad overall, but it wasn&#39;t that great either - the food and service.

It was busy, but I think the food could&#39;ve been served faster in addition the location is pretty noisy.  My mom HATED their Dickinson brand jelly, the toast had no butter, hash browns were extremely dry and blah. Sure they are hash browns, but I cook better hash browns.  Mom&#39;s omlette was lack luster in flavor and my pancakes had a gritty feel as if there is a large amount of corn meal in them and that&#39;s not what I enjoy in pancakes to say the least. The price wasn&#39;t bad but more than Mauri&#39;s where I usually go and I get more food their too.

Usually during the meal a wait staff asks how the food is... No one came over during our meal to ensure our satisfaction. My mom did get 2 refills of coffee total but many places with her I can see she will get up to 5 refills without blinking an eye. Both of us ended up having our water glasses go dry, which is a pet peeve of mine.

I usually am there for breakfast and have  had everything from the oatmeal to the huevos  rancheros, the specials, and the skillets depending on what mood I am in.  There&#39;s nothing that disappoints.  I do appreciate that the hash browns are thoroughly cooked to the right amount of crispness without too much oil.  A lot of cafes too often do not pay attention to the basics, and you&#39;ll end up with oily and limp shredded potatoes instead of hash browns.   No better way to start your day than with good, reasonably priced food served in a comfortable and friendly atmosphere.   BTW, the rest of the family heartedly gives Cafe Fourteen thumbs up."

She came over about 5 times and I was still glancing at the menu, talk about pressure! She did bring me coffee over and did stop by to refill it. They have the flavor creamers, my favorites. The menu offers a variety of things, so lots of options. I went with a ham, mushroom and cheese skillet. The flavor was good, lots of onions and mushrooms and lots of cheese, just like I like it. My only complaint was that the hash browns were a little over cooked and dry. Other than that I was pleased with my selection. I got it with an order of pancakes and the pancakes were nice and fluffy and the perfect size. It&#39;s a lot of food for the price. The inside is your basic diner decor. Very clean and neat.

When one of my friends was telling me about how much she loved diners and mentioned this as one of her favorites, I knew I had to give it a shot as I was driving by on a very hungry, empty stomach. I&#39;ve actually driven past this place many times -- it&#39;s an older brick building with a brown sign that doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside. Chin up and shoulders back, I walked in and asked for a table for one with a big smile. I was seated at a roomy booth in the middle of the restaurant.

My experience was probably completely different than everyone else&#39;s (or is it?). I was here on a weekday afternoon, a half hour before the place closed. Aside from two other men dining alone (one was sitting at the counter, talking very loudly into his cell phone), I was the only person eating in. Service was friendly, quick, and attentive -- even the food arrived super fast. Made sense, considering the circumstances.

Yet... my soup (cream of asparagus) arrived in an eye-popping large bowl. I had my own bread basket, filled with yumminess. My vegetable sandwich was huge -- and the fries were a perfect amount. Everything was gut-busting delicious!! As much as I wanted to, I couldn&#39;t eat it all. Half of the sandwich and fries came home with me for another tasty meal later. 

And... oh! The coffee creamers! I just started drinking coffee and pretty much won&#39;t drink it unless I can pour in some flavored creamer, mess around with it a bit until it&#39;s &#39;perfect&#39;, or pick up something from Starbucks. That said, when coffee is an option at most establishments, I won&#39;t order it because the typical half-and-half/creamer is gross. So.... imagine my delight when I saw the variety of little creamer cups in a bowl on my table! Whee! I ordered a coffee, used my creamer of choice, and was a happy Laura.

I paid my reasonable bill with a smile and was out the door with a Dum Dums lollipop.

I really wish I had known about this place when I lived in the area last year; I could have saved myself from experiencing some unhappy meals at other restaurants.

Cafe Fourteen, you won me over."

I usually get my matzo ball soup from the Buffalo, which is the same type of concept, Greek, family-owned diner.

Well, I didn&#39;t go for matzo ball soup, but I did go for breakfast.  On Saturday, I was up WAY  too early (for a Saturday) and much to my surprise, the BF suggested we go out for breakfast (one of my favorite things, one of his least favorite things.)  I should&#39;ve known he had something up his sleeve.

We went to Café Fourteen because he doesn&#39;t really care for any of the places within walking distance of our home, and because it was open early.

We were greeted immediately by who I can only presume is the owner, with a big smile and welcome.  The restaurant was not very crowded, maybe 3-4 other tables, but like I said, it was early. 

Our server was also very friendly and brought coffee/hot chocolate right away and let us peruse the menu.  I ordered the Mexican skillet and my boyfriend ordered the meat lover skillet.  We also ordered a side of the corned beef hash to share, because I had asked the server if it was homemade and she said &#34;no, but it is very good.&#34;  I&#39;m pretty picky about my CBH, and the other half insisted we try it.

We both enjoyed our breakfasts.  The eggs (over easy) were perfectly cooked, and my skillet was full of bold flavor, especially the jalapenos.  Everything went very well together.

I can see myself coming back to Café Fourteen over and over again for breakfast.  And the fact that we found a place where we BOTH enjoyed breakfast?  Now that&#39;s an accomplishment.

Two thumbs up for Café Fourteen!"

This is a lunch review, NOT a breakfast review.
The buzz I heard on Cafe Fourteen was that it was a Greek diner. NOTHING Greek on the menu that I could find for lunch, certainly not Moussaka, or Spanakopita, etc. There may have been somebody Greek in the kitchen slicing the turkey so thin that I could barely find it in my turkey sandwich underneath the obviously plastic wrapped thin swiss cheese.  The Manhattan soup was ok, but the fruit substituted for fries was not ripe except for the pineapple. So a couple of pieces of pineapple were the best part of my lunch, that and the plastic wrapped sesame breadsticks in a very boring breadbasket made up of plastic wrapped saltines and two pieces of loaf Italian bread. Oopa!

Pretty obviously an old Big Boy or something, and THAT is what I was hungry for after I had a very forgettable lunch here.  This is more of a Denny&#39;s that closes at 2:30; they are just making soup and sandwiches here on top of the breakfast menu.
I did get kind of a sour smile from the hostess when I requested a different booth, that might have been a Greek smile. I realize this is not going to be popular with the obviously local beakfast crowd reviews here but I didn&#39;t get any owner chatting me up he left early too, they were ready to close at 2:30 and it was a below average diner lunch.

Grammy D&#39;s is open until 2:30 and I would NEVER try going in there at 2:25, but Red Apple will serve you if you come in at 3:00. I almost got my check faster than my food at Cafe Fourteen at 2:30, they were ready to go, the sign says 3. See ya."

He greets me, as he does many regulars, with a warm handshake-hug, the kids get a pat on the head or a little light hearted teasing about growing up too fast. 
The food is always great, the servers are attentive and friendly and the prices are what you expect from a breakfast, &#34;after church&#34; type place. 
Speaking of which, it does get a crowd after services let out so expect a short delay especially if you have a large group. Enjoy a good meal and say hi to John, he&#39;ll remember you next time!"

ALWAYS good service.
Food is served fast and well presented. Breakfast is worth 5 stars, lunch/dinner 4.
For breakfast, try one of their skillets. This is the only place I have found that does them right. The hash-browns are crispy, not burnt or mushy, the eggs are light, fluffy and cooked to perfection. Veggies or other ingredients are sauteed to a &#34;T&#34;.
Not the perfect restaurant, but a very good one. Worth a trip out of your way."

Got a spinach and feta omelet. They&#39;re huge stuffed generously and come with plenty of hash browns. I got pancakes instead of toast. I was stuffed beyond belief and satisfied. I have gone back several times since and enjoy their consistency enough to write a thank you. And I always get a strawberry shake lol.

First, let&#39;s start with the coffee. It was a yummy Hawaiian Kona blend and on the table you are given a selection of flavored Coffee Mate creamers as an alternative to plain cream. I love when breakfast places offer a variety of creamers. My coffee was constantly full, they coffee guy even came to top off my coffee periodically to make sure that it remained hot. 

The food was awesome as well. I had the Fiesta Omelet which was jam packed with cheese, veggies and meat. The hash browns were nice and crispy. The pancakes were fluffy and flavorful. I really have nothing bad to say about the food. 

The service was fantastic. Everyone was friendly and always asking if they could get you anything. The interior is a little bit outdated. However, it seemed like the bathrooms had been redone recently and they were very clean."

I will not complain about the location of our booth, directly next to the dirty dishes they were busing off the busy, crowded tables nor will I complain about the incredibly rude table of 7 that was directly next to us, as you can&#39;t control the morons of the world.

What I WILL do is say that the food was quite good.  I ordered a steak skillet &amp; he ordered the hungry man skillet.  We were both pleased, though we agreed the portions of the skillets were only a touch smaller than expected for the price.  The pancakes were fluffy and served w/ plenty of butter &amp; syrup.  The coffee was good diner coffee and was constantly flowing, which is CRUCIAL in my world.

I will also commend our waitress, MELISSA, for being an amazingly attentive server who made sure she took care of us as best she could, even though she couldn&#39;t easily get to our table.  (That rude party of 7 refused to scoot their chairs in so she could pass behind them, no matter how many times she asked.)  Even though you could tell she probably wanted to backhand the hell out the rude table next to us, she kept a smile on her face and maintained above average service to the rest of her tables.  On a day where I would have lost my cool, and probably my job, she rose to the challenge; I commend her for that!

We will be back.  We will request to be seated in Melissa&#39;s station.  We will try new things and I&#39;m sure we will enjoy them just as much."

Inexpensive mexican food is a huge plus at this location. I had the steak chimichanga which has ample amount of beef. The dinner comes with rice, beans, and some gauc/sour cream which usually cost more at other restaurants. Service is fast and made to order. You can order carry out to save on tips, but you miss out on the free salsa and chips. Overall a step up from Taco Bell.

Honestly, we find it rather hard to find a Mexican restaurant (take out) that uses fresh ingredients, and it always taste the same! You are never left wondering, umm, that was not as good as I originally thought. 

With that being said, we&#39;ve never been disappointed! Very large serving sizes. The tacos are filled to the top of the shell. Burritos are what we call &#34;super sized&#34;. Super tasty, loaded with meat of your choice and variety of toppings. 
Tamales are always very fresh and tasty. 
Loaded nachos are seriously loaded to the top of the box! So many toppings, you cannot even see the chips. Box weighs almost five pounds. I kid you not. 

We usually get take-out, but have stopped in to eat, and experienced the same wonderful service as we do when getting take-out. When eating in, you are served chips and two types of salsa. 
Average wait time for food is 10-15 mins (if that)
Menu has a very large selection, and priced just right. Especially for the amount of food you receive. 

Place is pretty clean, minus the &#34;occasional&#34; funky smell in between the outside door, and door leading into the restaurant. 

I&#39;m usually not a huge salsa fan, but I do enjoy their red salsa."

I haven&#39;t been in the area long enough to know what this building was before TP, but I&#39;m speculating that it was a Taco Bell, right down to the booths.  I came in expecting to order at the counter, but I was told by an employee to have a seat and she would serve me.  Okay, cool.

I was greeted with chips, salsa, and a smile.  I decide to order the 3 taco dinner: I chose 3 different meats: chicken, beef, and pork.  The dinner also comes with beans, rice, and guacamole.  The chips and salsa were fresh and tasty, and assisted with my wait for my food (which was about 10 minutes).  I also enjoyed some silly Spanish-speaking soap opera on Univision.  I am not as fluent as I&#39;d like to be in Spanish, so most of the dialogue was lost on me.  I could only understand the doorbell ringing and someone&#39;s mother laughing.

The tacos were very good, with tender meat.  And also very filling.  I also ordered a cola (I forgot whether it was Pepsi or Coke) with my meal, and I neglected to ask about refills.  As such, I was charged for 2 drinks since I got 2 refills (you only get one refill for free).  So that was my boo-boo.

This is a nice place, with friendly people.  Even though I still have a favorite taqueria near me, I&#39;d come here for lunch/dinner if I&#39;m around this way.  It&#39;s pretty cool."

We&#39;re seriously considering finding another tacqueria as our latest experiences at Taco Patio have been disappointing, largely because of the inconsistency of the quality of the food. Sometimes the guacamole looks old and sometimes it&#39;s very sour. Sometimes the meat will be tender and sometimes it looks dry. Sometimes they put a lot of rice in the taco meal and sometimes there&#39;s barely any. I don&#39;t get it. 

About the only thing that is consistent is the staleness of the chips. Perhaps it&#39;s because they put the chips in the same container as the tacos, thus steaming the chips with the heat from the tacos. The chips should really come separately anyways. Nobody wants stale chips."

One time I ordered a tampiquena and it was soooo bland i could barely chew. Other time my beans where going bad. They tasted awful. Sometimes they put a lot of rice others they make me think they were running out.

Service is awful I honestly dont know how I went to this restaurant so many times. All servers look like they dont care. They&#39;re always talking to each other, next to the register. When they finally stop their chat they go to your table with such an attitude.

My friends and I just wanted something quickly that we could pick up and take to home to nosh on.  We went in on a Saturday night and we called in our order ahead of time and everything we ordered was warm, ready, tasty and CORRECT! And we had a lot of congested restrictions etc... They had really nice portions and everything looked and tasted fresh and of course better than your typical Americanized Mexican joint. The prices were pretty good as well. We got a mixture of chips and salsas to nachos  and a lot of stuff in between. 

The only issue I had is the little waiting ordering area is tiny and tight especially when there are a lot of people ordering or waiting for their orders. But after you partake in the yummy goodness that kind of goes to the wayside....

The GPS (Love Her, Hate Her, but still better than than the days of printing out maps and pulling over to boot the slow laptop and fire up the map program) listed Taco Patio so I said why not?

Very clean, excellent service. I got a carne asada taco and chips and salsa. The chips were very good, not greasy at all and I really liked the salsa. I didn&#39;t care at all for the red and green sauce in the bottles.

The taco was good, not spectacular, but very big for a single taco, with two corn tortillas - I ended up only eating around half with the fork that was thoughtfully provided.

I ordered a dinner set that included a taco, quesadilla, and tamale.
Taco was stuffed with a generous amount of well marinated pastor.  The quesadilla, although tasty, was kinda a lazy version.  It was literally just cheese melted between two tortillas.  It didn&#39;t have that crispy exterior one comes to expect form a quesadilla.  I generally don&#39;t like tamales; but this is definitely one of the better ones I&#39;ve ever eaten. 

The order can with a small cup of guac, and generous amounts of salsa.  Unfortunately they only had &#34;green&#39; salsa.  I tend to like &#34;red&#34; more.  Sorry, I know those aren&#39;t the official names; but you know what I mean.

Was around 10 pm on a Friday night and every place is closed...what is the deal with suburban eateries closing so early? Don&#39;t people eat after 9 pm? Anyways, Taco Patio was open and I was wanting a taco so it seemed like a match made in heaven.

Got 2 orders of taco meals to go. Both were chicken, mine was with cilantro and onion and my boyfriends had cheese, lettuce and tomato. The meal also came with rice &amp; beans and a small drink.

Honestly, I&#39;ve had better. I was really hoping for nice, flavorful and juicy pieces of chicken. The chicken was pretty dry and didn&#39;t have any memorable flavor. The rice seemed a bit dry too. Again, it was late at night and I was starving so it really didn&#39;t bother me. My bf mentioned that they must have had an off night because he&#39;s eaten there before and said it was much better before.

This location is more low key than the others, and the employees are friendly, as are the managers. Colonial has several comfort food style dishes on the menu- and is great for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert. My favorite breakfasts are the sunshine special or the fresh fruit crepes, I love the chicken Cesar salad and the tuna panini for lunch, and they have delicious burgers or meat loaf for dinner. For desserts I love the Kahuna crunch or the PBF chipper- they also have excellent peppermint ice cream which I love in the winter months.

The Kitchen Sink! This dessert item alone bumps up my ratings from 3 to 4 stars for the food. Where else can you get two whole bananas, two scoops of vanilla, two scoops of chocolate &amp; two scoops of strawberry. Topped with chocolate, strawberry, and pineapple toppings, covered with whipped cream, chopped almonds &amp; a cherry.  After you finish you get a bumper sticker saying you ate the kitchen sink! This is great for 2 people to share or more if you are okay sharing saliva, but the visual appeal of this dessert is amazing. You can&#39;t go wrong with the other dessert items either like the turtle sundae or brownie with ice cream. The actual food here is only average. I ended up with the pot roast and mash potatoes which tasted like food from a cafeteria. Servers are friendly. Maybe next time I should try the burgers or sandwiches.

Pro- great dessert items, the kitchen sink :)

Con- the actual entrees are subpar, your typical comfort food

Give me all the ice cream. That is all.

OK, not all. TONS of choices, but if it has peanut butter in it, all the better. Never had the nerve to order the Kitchen Sink, saving that one for the bucket list. Other items served in appropriate ice cream parlor style glassware, not plastic bowls or cups (mentioning this for those used to fast-food joint ice cream). Always had good service, quick and accurate. Priced as you&#39;d expect.

Did I say I want ALL the ice cream yet?"

Known mostly for their ice cream and shakes, they have every variety known to man. Seriously, they have a four page menu dedicated just to the sweets. If you need a serious sugar rush, you might want to check them out. For $14 they serve you mounds of ice cream in a miniature stainless steel device shaped and aptly named &#34;The Kitchen Sink&#34;.

As ice cream was not on my mind early in the morning, fish tacos were the order of the day. They are served either with white fish or talapia tacos. There&#39;s about a dozen sides that you can choose from. I opted for the southern style green beans with bacon.

The girl who was serving us was pleasant enough, but had what appeared to be bad habit of which she was unaware. When taking our orders and checking up on us, she would still be talking to us as she was walking away, almost like she was in a hurry to get away from people. As a a waitress, hospitality is the name of the game. Perhaps she has a bit of social anxiety, but it was odd behavior to witness. The place was anything but busy, so rushing away really was uncalled for.

As for the food, the Cabo tacos were spicy, but not unbearable. The fish was cooked well-done in a fryer and were breaded, but not overly doughy. The paired green beans were really overcooked and were mushy. Hardly anything better than you can get out of a can, which isn&#39;t saying much. A friend ordered the Strawberry French Toast which quite tasty per her.

In all, it wasn&#39;t a bad place to nibble on the offerings, just that it wasn&#39;t anything spectacular either."

It&#39;s actually one of my favorite breakfast spots. My favorite meal (which I try not to order because I feel overly stuffed for the next 5 hours) is the country sausage skillet without cheese. It&#39;s really good and I also get the morning glory muffin to add a little sweetness with the meal. 

My fiance orders chicken and waffles and it is also amazing! The chicken alone is delicious, so I would also recommend the chicken fingers. I&#39;ve also eaten at Colonial for lunch and the salads I have tried have all been great.

Unfortunately I always forget about Colonial Cafe when I&#39;m in the mood for ice cream, so I have never tried it. One day I will have to order the colonial kitchen sink!"

My own imposed rules for any review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Must order something unique each visit.
3. If they have any &#34;signature&#34; items on the menu, you must order a &#34;signature&#34; item at least once.
4. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Colonial Cafe - Elgin

Location/Layout - 6/10:  Located just south of Route 20 on the Northwest corner of McLean Blvd and Spartan Dr (the ECC entrance).  The building is unmistakable if you are familiar with Colonial and resembles the iconic images found all over their branding.  The interior has been updated recently which includes a very vibrant color scheme and lighting.  I personally preferred the older scheme with the beiges and maroons along with the old time imagery of farms and creameries but no matter the interior design the restaurant is always clean and usually organized.  

Menu - 7/10:  The breakfast, lunch and dinner menu is standard diner fare.  To Colonial&#39;s credit they always have seasonal offerings and chef&#39;s specials, which gives regulars and new comers some variety.  Additionally, and more importantly in my opinion, Colonial offers a stand alone ice cream menu since this is what the company was founded on.  You will find classics including a black cow, floats, and sundaes but also unique takes on custom creations such as my personal favorite the PBF chipper, the ET and the iconic Kitchen Sink. 

Service - 6.5/10: The service is usually very friendly and accommodating.  We are always greeted with a smile and treated very well throughout our meals, even if it is just dessert.  Refills and requests are filed in expedited fashion.  The lone issue we ever encounter is that we have waited to be seated while servers past us by at the greeting booth and we have had to wait to check out, since you pay up front.  Both minor annoyances but they still exist.  

Food - 6.5/10:  The standard menu options vary greatly.  The breakfast items, which are served all day, seem to be the most consistent and all are very solid options.  Some sandwich options are delicious such as any of the Turkey options but the Pot Roast dip which is a signature item needs work and leaves a tinny flavor (maybe canned au jus) in your mouth for quite some time.  Their comfort classics, which are their dinners, are all fairly good especially the turkey dinner, with the exception again being the pot roast.  Where Colonial truly excels is their ice cream creations.  They are always created unique for each guest, meaning that you can call your ice cream flavors and add/delete or amend any toppings.  The options are almost too many as it creates too much indecision on which decadent treat to choose.  My suggestion is that you must at least once in your life try a Kitchen Sink; if for no other reason then seeing this creation sitting at your table and watching the jealous on lookers around you.  Plus you will earn the coveted bumper stinker that allows you to proclaim to the world that you ate enough calories for an entire week and enough sugar to send a diabetic into shock.  Prices are very reasonable, but the desserts can get pricey if you indulge too heavily but it is a treat after all.     

Drinks - 6.5/10:  Colonial offers the standard soft drink options that one is accustomed too from a diner including coffees, teas, and juices (some locations also offer beer).  While these go well with most standard menu options, I typically like a hand dipped shake which always comes with a little extra in the shaker.

Overall Experience - 7/10:  Colonial is a Fox Valley tradition.  It is a family friendly diner that offers enough options to keep the entire family or group happy.  We used to hit this place up in droves back in little league then high school and also while attending ECC.  We still continue to see church groups, teams, and organizations meet here regularly.  I highly suggest that you come for the ice cream but get a bite while you are here."

My friend and I headed here on a Wednesday to try and see what kind of trouble we could get into.  As it turns out, a lot :)

Our waitress, Allison, was super sweet and helpful!  She didn&#39;t even laugh at me when she saw me looking at the dessert menu before the dinner one!

I ordered the Meatloaf (substituting fries for mashed potatoes) and a side of broccoli, and my friend ordered the CA Turkey Grill.  We both LOVED our meals.  They were not only ready five minutes after we ordered, but they were delicious and there was plenty of food to go around.  They don&#39;t skimp on their portions here!  

Every bite of my meatloaf had either a green pepper or an onion in it, which I loved.  It was chocked full of ingrdients and flavor, and there were three cute little loaves of it.  It was great!  I sampled my friend&#39;s sandwich, and that was delicious as well.

As good as the food was, though, the desserts were that much better.  I mean, I will come back for the food, but I am definitely coming here for the desserts.  We ordered the PB Chipper and the Caramel Pecan Cinful Pie.  Both of them were a.ma.zing. Allison was nice enough to let me substitute Peanut Butter chocolate ice cream for the regular chocolate in the PB Chipper, and it just made it all that much better!  And the Cinful Pie was great as well--flaky crust covered in caramel?  Yes, please!!

I will definitely be back--maybe even for breakfast since they had a cinnamon roll french toast that looked amazing!  But I, of course, will still be ordering dessert!"

It slightly amazes me that a place that more or less advertises itself as an ice cream shop, has such an amazing item on their breakfast menu.  My wife and I are big fans of pumpkin pancakes when restaurants start serving them in the fall.  Colonial, hands down, has the best we have tried.  It isn&#39;t even close.  Do yourself a favour and the next time you are in, order up the pumpkin pancake combo and see for yourself!

As for the rest of the food, some things are pretty good, others things I would avoid.  The Ranchero Carnitas Omelette is very good, as is the Monterrey Omelette.  I tried the pot roast one night.  Nope, won&#39;t be doing that again.  More or less, this is our go to place when I want breakfast for dinner (and really, is there anything better than breakfast for dinner??!!!).  Why?

We usually go to St. Charles &amp; love it.  Today was a horrible experience. There were 2 of us - we waited 15 min. while there were plenty of empty tables. The hostess Natalie appeared to be much more involved with the other hostess &amp; herself than in customers.  When we were finally seated by Alissa we were told they seat based on how the kitchen is doing.  Our waitress took our order promptly &amp; we proceeded to wait over 1/2 hour for an order of nachos &amp; a bowl of soup, that was smaller than what we get in St. Charles. My husband asked if it was the cup &amp; the response was &#34;that&#39;s our bowl size&#34;. The nachos were borderline cold. The waitress did offer to have them remade but at that point we had wasted too much time already.  Had to remind the waitress that I ordered a drink.   The nachos were horrible.  Very little cheese, much of which was not melted &amp; what was seemed coagulated from being cold.  The chili on top appeared to have been microwaved mutliple times and had hardly any meat, just a little sauce over the chips, so that none of the chips on the bottom had anything on them.  Sprinkled over it all was chili powder like it came out of a salt shaker.  There was a lot of staff just hanging out talking to each other.  When we were checking out I handed Alissa my member card &amp; she handed it back without punching it.  When I pointed it out she acted like I was putting her out.  Meanwhile, Natalie was at the next register telling a customer how she didn&#39;t know how to run it.  I would say there is a definite need for some employee training at this location.  I&#39;m not sure if we will ever go back or if we will stick to the other locations that we know are good."

After every dance, every Christmas pageant, and when we discovered coffee and smokes in high school... Colonial. 

I can now safely say after a lifetime of going there that Colonial is at best, mediocre. The ice cream is great and that&#39;s why you should go, but I&#39;m not much of a dessert person so the only two must-haves for me are the cheddar cheese chowder and the only place I can get a proper vanilla Coke in town. The salads are boring, the sandwiches are bland, the hash browns are dry - and worst of all, overpriced these days.

We will make sure to order from Colonial again for future meetings. I made certain to call the manager back to tell him what a great job everyone had done for us.  He thanked us very much for the business."

When I was a college student at ECC back in the early 80&#39;s, the food was great! It has seemed to go down hill from there. The last straw was last Sunday evening about 6;30 at night. My Son and myself thought we would give it another try, as we both love the pot roast french dip. Upon bringing our drink orders and we attempting to order our favorite item on the menu, the waitress tells us they&#39;re out of pot roast. How in the heck can you run out of pot roast? The place had only one other table of people that time of night, which should&#39;ve given us a clue right there. So then I attempt to order the pulled pork and she says they&#39;re out of that too. if we wouldn&#39;t of had our drinks already I would&#39;ve left. Then a few minutes later she comes back to t he table and tells me, oh yes, they do have pulled pork. She thought it was pot roast too. The food came and the portions were small. The pulled pork should have been slathered in bbq sauce and it was just lying on the bun with a dollup of bbq sauce. What a let down. My Son ordered the chicken fingers, and I must say he did get 6 large fingers, so his wasn&#39;t such a bad deal, but the meal wasn&#39;t excellent. Next time I will go to Pauls like I usually do. I am done with Colonial."
colonial-cafe-elgin-3,Kate K.,WI9UJah3bVB258wzEIh34A,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,566,4,5_0GEd_gK45fQK9sR7hBJQ,4.0,2007-06-03,"A trip down memory lane...

Just for reference, I was born in Elgin, Illinois and lived there until I was 11 years old.  At that time my family moved to Kent, Ohio where I lived until I was in my mid-twenties...  I remember very little about Elgin... except things connected with my family: Pot-luck dinners at a church, going for a bike ride in a particularly big park, my brother&#39;s endless little-league games, my uncles taking me to the municipal swimming pool... and, spending time with my grandpa.

Grandpa Jim.

I am the oldest of 21 grandchildren.  I think that&#39;s right.  And, now there are a few great-grandchildren thrown in there too... the count for baby-boom off spring might be up to at least 25.

Being the oldest grandchild and the only girl for something like seven years until my cousin Lori came along... I was just a touch spoiled as a child.  Imagine.  I was my uncles and my grandpa&#39;s angel-baby-girl... I was the little strawberry-blond princess of the Doyle clan... I was special.

Oh yes.

Saturdays were my Grandpa days: He used to take me to Lord&#39;s Park to see Big Jim the Buffalo.  That&#39;s right, they had a buffalo at a park in Elgin, Illinois - random, right?  Anyhow - I think my grandpa felt some kinship of some sort with Big Jim the Buffalo, because it was one of his favorite things to do... they were both big, lumbering and quiet.  I remember wondering if they named that buffalo after my grandpa.  After we sat there for a while Grandpa Jim would take me to Colonial Cafe for a Turtle Sundae.

I remember sitting in my grandpa&#39;s lap and running my fingers along the outline of the tattoo on the inside of his forearm: a heart, almost exactly like the one I have on my left shoulder, with the name &#34;Ruth&#34; in the banner - he got it during the war while stationed in Korea.  Ruth being my grandma.  I remember the smell of his Lucky Strike filter-less cigarettes mixing with his Old Spice aftershave... he had this leather chair that was &#34;his&#34; chair and sometimes when he wasn&#39;t home I&#39;d just curl up in that chair because it smelled like him... Grandpa.

I actually spent a lot of time at my grandparent&#39;s house as a young kid due to the fact that my mom was putting her self through graduate school with two small children to support... 890 West Chicago Street was like a second home to me - more familiar and comfortable than my own, at times.

Grandpa Jim was a big hulking man and never much of a talker - he still isn&#39;t in fact.  I think that the combination of war and alcohol kind of made him introverted and not exactly the most accessible person.  Those times with the buffalo and the ice cream are the only times I really ever remember connecting with him; though, I know that I was (and, am) the apple of his eye.

Big hulking man with little strawberry blond child sitting on a bench watching a buffalo.

Today I had a chance to go hang out with my Grandpa: time has changed him immensely - he is old and fragile and quieter than he even was the last time I saw him... he doesn&#39;t talk except about the Chicago Cubs and occasionally about politics (during which time - he being the staunch Republican and me being the child of his liberal-hippie daughter - I tend to just smile and nod...)  I would have taken him to see Big Jim the Buffalo - yet, sadly Big Jim died a couple of years back (which I know because my cousin Lori told me that Grandpa mentioned it to her and called her &#34;Katie&#34; when she took him out to Sunday lunch.)  Instead I just took him to Colonial Cafe which is as much a part of my memories of him as anything else.

In the twenty-two some odd years since the last time I was there, Colonial hasn&#39;t changed a bit.  It&#39;s still a greasy-spoon diner with bad patty melts and malts and sundaes.  They still sponsor the little league teams and bowling leagues... they still have hand churned peppermint ice cream (my Mom&#39;s favorite) and vinyl booths that your legs stick to in the summer and a sundae called &#34;The Kitchen Sink&#34; which I was and always will be too nauseated by the concept of to ever try... though, my brother Mike ate a whole one by himself when he was eight, got the bumper sticker that said &#34;I ate the Kitchen Sink&#34; and then promptly vomited the Kitchen Sink up in the back of my Grandma&#39;s 1976 Dodge Dart.

Change comes slower to towns than to people, I suppose."

Just about everything on the menu is simply average with nothing exceptional to separate Colonial Cafe from any other sit down restaurant. However, the prices are very fair and their breakfast (which is served all day) is good. What Colonial Cafe is really known for, however, is their delicious ice cream and shakes including the classic &#34;kitchen sink&#34; which is big enough for four people.

Was looking forward to trying this place out since it&#39;s new and had good reviews so far.  Came in for lunch and we ordered a vegetarian burrito and the taco platter with rice and beans.  The rice was quite flavorful with a great deep orange color, unfortunately it was a little dry, but no different than the vast majority of Mexican restaurants.

The tacos were fine, pretty flavorful and a good enough portion size for a lunch meal.  No cheese on the tacos, which I prefer, but it did come with lime and salsa.  On the salsa side, the salsa verde was pretty good, but the salsa roja was terribly overpowered with an almost dry chili powder flavor.  The meat was well seasoned, but the steak was a little overcooked and chewy, and the chicken was dry. The vegetarian burrito was less well received.  My dining partner said that it contained a number of uncooked vegetables, and wasn&#39;t particularly tasty.

The location itself was pretty nice, clean and a little larger than I expected.  The staff was very nice, and I always appreciate when they give you the choice between traditional cilantro and onion or lettuce and tomato.  

All in all, it&#39;s a decent, quick Mexican restaurant.  It&#39;s not quite as cheap as a few places out by Hanover Park, or as good as some of the less fast-foody places in the area, but it works if you&#39;re looking for something close by."

I appreciate the sliced chicken rather than soggy pulled pollo, but there isn&#39;t enough of it. I normally go through 2 or 3 salsas when I get a burrito at Los Laureles or any of my Chicago spots. This little guy only required half of one salsa, which was also a disappointment. A tip: If you&#39;re chillin over in that part of town and want a burrito, roll over to Pancho&#39;s."

Their tacos are to die for- filled with meat till bulky like nowhere else, and...the meat is top quality- juicy, tasty, and fresh! Rib eye in taco? Common, and it is soooooo goood!!!! Tortillas are like in Mexico- you taste the grain, not the GMO. Rice and beans are great- very comforting, delicious, and we order it just because it has that fulfilling flavorful quality. There were delicious grilled jalapenos added to our order, so awakening and yummy! Their menu recently upgraded, there is more to choose from ( including organic juice bar) and their open hours are extended which is awesome considering the late night craves. They also deliver in the area, which we haven&#39;t had a chance to utilize yet, but I&#39;m sure the moment will come :-D Salsas are decent- I wish they had mild one, for the weaker breed- I love the kick their sauces have but for some it is a bit too much to handle. Regardless, these guys know their authentic taste- and they will please you with customization if you wish. Besides, they are sweethearts- they gave us extra tacos for bigger order, and their customer service is kind and interactive. Give them a try! This this place rocks!"

Quite a few varities of coffee, pies and they have some cookies, muffins. I think kids will love this place to have a quick breakfast in the morning. The staff is friendly. It might be a $1/2 more expensive on every dish, but if you were going to get one/two you would not be spending too much.

I got the veggie quiche, which is pretty good, the egg &amp; cheese panini, which was ok because the bread was really hard. Also got the chocolate bar with almonds, that was ok - a crunchy slab of sweet nutty flavor.

But the REAL reason to come here is for the PIE...Soooo many pies....and if they don&#39;t have what you want put in a request &amp; the owner will most likely be able to whip one up for you with advance notice.  The pies are on the pricey side compared to your supermarket but THESE PIES make those other ones look &amp; taste like cardboard.  Worth. Every. Penny.

The seating is mainly outside with just a few tables inside.  And honestly who wants to eat inside when you can sit out on the lawn and people watch those going along the Fox River Trail?"

I&#39;ve often stopped there while biking, grabbing a muffin or brownie, and I&#39;ve never been disappointed. The atmosphere is perfect for a summer&#39;s day, with shady outdoor seating, bike racks and a bit of accordion music playing - it feels very much like a small French bistro. 

I tried the quiche for the first time yesterday, and it was delicious, as was the blueberry muffin.  The selection varies, but it&#39;s always good,"

It&#39;s a cute little cafe type place with French music playing in the background.  I ordered what looked like a calzone but it had a different name I cannot remember.  It was fresh and oozing with cheese and spinach.  I also ordered the iced vanilla with caramel coffee....I wanted another.  I also ordered the yummy brownie with what seemed to be cream cheese swirled into it.  Yum!  Not a huge menu of choices but a nice selection nonetheless.  With the friends we came with I also got to sample the breakfast pizza and the TMC which I will be ordering next time I go back.  
All exceptional food and like that it&#39;s all prepared in house.  Definitely worth a stop in, you won&#39;t be disappointed.  I do have to add...I liked the seating outside and that is was kid and dog friendly.  Being a huge dog owner I loved the welcoming of dogs and that they had water bowls set up outside.  Very tasty...glad I stopped in..I will be spreading the word.  
Oh one last thing...some of their items are gluten free and although I am not gluten intolerant it was nice to see.  I&#39;ve noticed a lot of places are catering to gluten free diets and it was nice to see here."

In the old part of town in East Dundee this place offers fresh pastries along w/ a small menu for breakfest and lunch.  As I showed up in the morning and the only customer I ordered the breakfest quiche (3 different choices), mine had ham, green peppers, onions, and cheese.  You can tell this wasnt there first time around making one.  It was very tasty!  Crust was right on perfect w/ flavor and perfectly cooked.  Then I had to try a peanut butter cookie and it was really good, kinda expensive cookie for a dollar.  I guess...I definitely fell in love w/ the huge dish of bread pudding that they offered but I figured I&#39;d save that for when I come back for lunch!  I was tempted just to ask how much for that whole dish, but then I figured it was summertime and that wouldnt be good for the abs.  :)  Wait staff was super duper nice as well.

There&#39;s a case of baked goods that is full of diet ruination, but you can tell yourself you&#39;re going to have the quiche or the homemade Chicken and Dumpling soup and then fall into your planned temptation once there&#39;s no escape.  There&#39;s a chalkboard on the wall that lists all the pies owner, Arlene has made, but she takes requests, even if there&#39;s no recipe involved.  Every day she bakes a couple of pies, full and individual sized and fills the rest of the bakery case with treats that will make you mumble, OMG through a sweet-filled mouth.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, there is nothing on the menu that isn&#39;t great.  I once wrote an article about this place for The Daily Herald and she sent me home with samples that ate on the way home in case someone at my house felt like I should share.

My only complaints are that we only go when the weather is nice because the only real seating is outside.  I could take it home, but juggling it with the kids is more than I want to deal with.

It&#39;s fantastic.  I go at least once a week to various ones in the NW burbs.  I&#39;d give the chain in general 5 stars... but this particular location over two separate visits has proven to be crap.  

My wife and I went a year and a half ago when she was pregnant.  My wife was being careful of what she ate over concern for the baby, and so she asked if they could cook the steak a little longer for her just to heat it up and make extra sure of killing salmonela (sp?) etc.  it was mid afternoon and there were maybe 1 or 2 other people in the joint.  The lady serving said no with attitude.  My wife isn&#39;t fond of confrontation, so she didn&#39;t say anything at the time and we went home.  After the 5 minute car ride, we got home, opened up, and ate... and discovered the steak we both got was actually lukewarm or colder.  My wife tossed hers because she was already angry over the experience.  I ate mine, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as enjoyable as usual.

fast forward a year or two later and i went there with my mom when she was visiting.  This time we went at about 7pm on a weekday.  The only thing we asked for this time was extra rice and some extra meat (was feeling particularly hungry, and sometimes they give you some extra).  Server lady was stand offish again (can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s the same one), and gave smaller than normal portions of rice and steak.  Again, the steak managed to be slightly cold.  

Morale of the story - skip this chipotle, skip it good.  drive the extra 5 minutes to the one at barrington &amp; schaumburg rd., or on golf &amp; roselle.

management needs to clean house or infuse a new attitude.  and keep their food warmer."

So, far, it pretty much matches the service and quality that the one in Schaumburg provides.  I usually get take-out there, but it&#39;s decor is about the same as the one in Schaumburg, just newer.

I&#39;m always happy with the Chipotle quality of food with every Chipotle I go too.   Only a few times has the chicken/steak been kinda cold/sitting there for a while, but that was more in the beginning.  

Nowadays, I have seen it improve and the people there are always so friendly and the service is quick.

I highly recommend their steak, as they cook it until it&#39;s still a little red inside. Portions are enormous - I could easily make two meals out of their rice bowl, but it&#39;s always a struggle to not keep shoveling the food into my mouth because it&#39;s so tasty. 

The service at this location is great, too. People always come around and ask if everything&#39;s okay about halfway through my meal. The only thing I would mention is that their chips tend to be overly salted, so ask for them unsalted or lightly salted, if you&#39;re watching your sodium intake.

Oh yeah, and drop your card in. My friend won take-out for 10 people (including chips and drinks) just the other day. It gave me a chance to &#34;splurge&#34; and try my steak rice bowl with extra guacamole - really good idea, btw, in case you&#39;re wondering."

Its a newly hyped restaurant...

The good...
Beautiful indoor and outdoor space
Attentive servers (our server came by three time to check in with us while we were picking out drinks).  We went on a Saturday night so it was packed both inside and out!
Have a party room 
ALOT of TVsssss!!!

Maybe like fresh paint? It was strange and off putting. It was 3pm on a Saturday, so not busy. Yet it took about 30 minutes to get drinks. Food came out relatively quickly. It looked great, but didn&#39;t have a ton of flavor. Buffalo chicken dip didn&#39;t taste much like buffalo, more like sour cream. Pour House burger didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor either. The fries were good though. And they have a large drink selection.
I know this place is still new, so maybe in a couple months I&#39;ll come back and give it a second try. But for now, not a fan."

It was a nice day so we sat outside on the patio. The place is brand new and has a nice modern design. The patio was nice but there wasn&#39;t enough shade from the umbrellas and there were also a lot of flying insects everywhere. Our server was prompt and courteous and made a few suggestions on drinks and food. I went with a local brew. They do have an extensive beer list. Was bummed that they ran out of GumballHead. Food wise we had the buffalo chicken dip for an appetizer and I went with the meat loaf. The buffalo dip was good. I found the meat loaf underwhelming. The carrots and peas looked like they came straight out of a freezer bag. Service was good. Not sure I would return for the food. Maybe just to have some drinks sometimes.

Short ribs were decent but over priced for the size of the entrée.  Anastasia, the bartender may want to try being a princess since she wasn&#39;t interested in working to hard. She gave me a menu and took my order but that was the last I saw her until I flagged her down for the check.  I was able to get the attention of another bartender to order the second flight and a couple others for questions I had.

The crab fondue was amazing. We truly enjoyed the blend of crab and cheese with  a baguette for dipping.
I am giving 4 stars instead of 5, because I was surprised at our bill. We had a total of 6 beers and 1 appetizer and our bill was $67 before tip.  The beers were under 9%, so I was surprised at the $8/$8.50 price point.

The beer selection was okay, however, compared to competitors such as Yard House, which also offers a extensive selection of craft beer, the beer selection could improve. The sours and Imperial IPA offering was very limited.  Regarding the food, I can only speak to the Duck Confit Nachos. The duck was rather plain, however, it was accompanied by a variety of fresh complimentary ingredients. I have to rave about the house pickled jalapeños, which in my opinion was &#34;the&#34; accent to the dish. The cheese sauce fell far from expectations and resembled a simple roux. It needs more character.  If a second visit is merited I&#39;d probably stick with their signature burger per the description. Let&#39;s only hope it executes well. Cheers!"

The Positives
- Beautiful indoor and outdoor space
- Attentive servers
- The meatloaf is some of the best around, flavorful and cooked very well, and great red eye gravy

The NOT-so Positives
- Incredibly slow bar service - us, as well as several tables we could hear around us had issues with beverages arriving.  One table had their 2nd drink arriving after they finished meal and obviously no longer wanted it, with server suggesting it could be &#34;dessert&#34;.
- Drink inconsistency - ordered signature Cucumber melon martini - first 2 arrived green, last arrived red with server stating &#34;it was a different bartender&#34;.  If it&#39;s one of their signature cocktails on the menu, shouldn&#39;t *all* the bartenders know how to make the same signature drink?
- Fried Pickles - too salty, especially w/ salty ranch dressing and very greasy - soaked up the extra grease of one piece that saturated a cocktail napkin
- Short-rib Dinner - $24 dinner which is one of the most expensive on the menu, mine arrived as literally 95% gristle, side of grits were incredibly bland and tasteless and gritty (not in the good way), shrimps were straight out of a grocery store pre-cooked fish department, with zero seasoning or flavor.
- Meatloaf side dishes - supposed to be Yukon Gold, but clearly russets as they were as white as rice, dry and a bit musty in flavor, carrot/pea side had way undercooked carrots to the point they were almost raw.
- Portions - seem to be the right size unless you need to take home leftovers, but their plating eludes to the fact you are getting appetizer sized portions on enormous plates.

In the end, I am not one to want to send food back and this was probably only the 2nd time I&#39;ve done so, but the shortrib dinner was just incredibly awful.  The manager was nice enough to comp the shortrib meal in looking at it and realizing it was &#34;not their standard&#34;, but assured us the &#34;Executive Chef and two sous chefs&#34; hold the highest of standards - may have been easier to believe had he tucked in his dress shirt and wore big boy shoes and not gym shoes.

We enjoyed the pretzel bites and buffalo chicken dip for appetizers. For entrees we had salmon, short ribs, barbecue ribs and chicken Caesar wrap. The ribs were on the burnt side. We also sampled the bread pudding and peanut butter cup. The pudding again was a bit overdone. Our server was present but not always aware-especially regarding drinks.

Beer selection good and have some good local stuff there (e.g. Solemn Oath &#39;Pain Cave&#39;). Food was good 1 day then at best average the next visit. Although serving staff seem friendly enough they simply are not attentive- twice we sat at bar and had to flag down other servers and in one case the front door girl in order to get the check/ service. Once when sat at a table it was 10minutes without a server coming by so we ditched. Could be much better if some effort went into customer service

Hosted forgot us because I went up to ask if the buzzer worked.  Sat us around 6:15 and we ordered 2 pizzas (thin crust) and cheese bread.  Appetizer came quickly but after 30 minutes I asked about our pizzas. Server said they were coming. Another 10 minutes pass and I ask the hostess, who forgot about us.  
She goes to check.  One pizza was done but they had problems with the oven. What??  I can see the kitchen, pizzas coming out of ovens the whole time.
Finally one pizza comes out and I say forget it.  Manager comes out to apologize comps the drinks and the one pizza.  Says the kitchen has been a nightmare all day.  I explained about the hostess. Same thing problems all day
Visit at your own risk. 
The team at Village pizza  is definitely in rebuilding mode.

The lie of the pizza is coming, the oven breaking and the hour plus wasted. It what ticks me off."

Never knew the server&#39;s name so I can&#39;t single her out. Ordered a dirty martini on rocks.... got a Margarita.  Ordered a Coke with lime..... she had to be reminded 4 times to bring limes. Fiance ordered a water... waitress came back and asked if she wanted a water. What part of &#34;may I have a water please?&#34; would make a person ask if you want it.  

I did ask my fiance after she got the water if she really wanted it. She said no I like having pizza without anything to wash it down (sarcasm font).

I was a server for years and was able to make a good wage doing it. I wonder how this girl survives let alone takes orders and has a job. 

Weird thing. She disappeared for at least 10 minutes when we were ready for a refill. Had an awkward encounter when I got up to go to the bar to get refills, fresh drinks in hand and low and behold she graced us with her presence at the table. I had to pardon myself because I was thirsty. 

On a better note the pizza is great. Had cheese and sausage. Great crust meat and cheese! Will be back for the food and not the service. Rosati buffet has better service than this place. At least they know how to refill a drink."

Sadly, an up charge of $2 on a 9&#34; pizza turned me off, especially since it turned out to taste &#34;cardboardy.&#34; Being gluten intolerant, I feel that it&#39;s wrong to charge me that much for one meal. Basically a 20% surcharge. I know GF ingredients cost more, but they don&#39;t cost THAT much more. We don&#39;t charge diabetics more for sugarfree, even though SF substitutes cost more than sugar, so why is this practice acceptable?

Hubby chose the buffet and asked, &#34;Will there be any cheese pizza?&#34; And his answer was, &#34;Nope,&#34; and she walked off. 

No &#34;cheese&#34; pizza on a pizza buffet??? Seems odd. 

Anyway, server was nice, place was clean, and other than the $2 up charge, the prices were inexpensive, but I&#39;m from out of town, so I won&#39;t be able to give them a second chance. :("

We had our two kids with and it was even getting on their nerves.  After hunting down the server and actually getting up to leave a manger rushed over.  She apologized, and our pizza was brought out soon after.  It wasn&#39;t well done as we had ordered but my kids were starving so they ate it.  I was so aggravated that I lost my appetite and didn&#39;t even want to eat at that point.  Very poor customer service.  I understand if you have a big party to cook for but the servers should be explains ahead of time there would be a delay.

We had the lunch buffet here and it was terrible at best. The two stars are for the breadsticks; which is about all I&#39;d recommend from the buffet. They had something that resembled breaded and BQQ chicken that was mostly overcooked and little to no meat, very thinly cut pizza slices that were also overcooked on top and cold in the center. They also had something that looked like hashbrowns covered in cheese...also cold. Lastly, the salad area didn&#39;t offer anything low cal and the lettuce was turning brown.

The service was poor** and the price was too high for the quality of food. 

** We were greeted with an unenthusiastic , &#34;Just you two? Follow me.&#34; And that was followed up with a waitress that walked by our table several times and never refilled our drinks. I finally had to flag her down to get her attention.

The pizza is thin and tastes good with reasonable pricing. It&#39;s not my favorite, but with so many other options it&#39;s a great place to go."

We&#39;ve been several times and always have had a good pie. So tonight I tried something a little different. I went with a Mexican pizza. lately i&#39;ve been getting into jalapenos so i figured why not go with a Mexican Za. well it came out I got the 9 inch which was perfect size. The crust is super thin and crisp which I love. The pizza did have a nice spice to it there were a lot of jalapenos and tomatoes black olives and cheese. quite good! I do recommend for something a bot different

Village does have the history originating in Carpentersville and Nick&#39;s has the family feel with Nick coming around and chatting up his diners. 
The Elgin Village location is near my work and my co-workers tend to crave the occasional pizza from here. I have done both carry out and dine in at this location and the staff is always very friendly, the facility is always clean, and the Za is excellent."

They now charge you $2 for an additional basket of peanuts. You used to be able to get multiple baskets without a charge! How much does it cost them for a bag of peanuts? They are down the street from Fisher nuts. I&#39;m sure there isn&#39;t much of a cost to them! 

Second thing I noticed, was again about the peanuts! I watched the bus boy clean a table and bring a half full basket of peanuts back to the hostess!! Never dumped them just placed them back on the shelf to be given out again!! How unsanitary is that? What if someone sneezed on the basket? It is not right!! 

Third thing I noticed, was the lack of service and then pushiness of the server. We waited 10 minutes for her to come to the table and ask for out drink orders and wanted our good order right away when we weren&#39;t ready yet. I then waited 15 minutes to get a refill of my lemonade. Because that is how long it took for her to come back once she took our order! She didn&#39;t bring our order to the table, someone else did. She came back 1 time to ask how everything was and then asked if we were ready for a box. We were still eating!! 

What happened to being asked if you need anything else before getting the check? 

This used to be a family pizzeria now I don&#39;t feel that!"

I took my family there just the other day on a Wednesday. First, you walk through a big heavy door, probably to work off all that pizza. ;) Then you can either go into the bar area or ask to be seated by the host in the restaurant. The host was so kind and helpful! My group came in at different times and she directed all of them right to our table. Also, we had a lovely waitress. Even though we could tell she was busy, she made it a point to take time to come check on us every few minutes.
 Also, we learned that this place has food runners, also known as the carry out workers, which is why the server doesn&#39;t bring the food out all the time. *** Smart idea if you ask me because then the servers have more time with the tables. ***
Finally, once the children in my family arrived, they went straight to the game room. It was nice because we had gotten a seat right near the game room to watch the children. They had a blast! Also the place is decorated with animals which became a great learning tool for the kids to learn about different animals. Plus, the kids loved the coloring sheets and the fish tank. 
The pizza is incredible and the double decker is my favorite and unlike anything I have had before! Plus, you can throw peanut shells on the floor and not have to clean up the mess! But beware if you have an allergy.
 Village Pizza is incredible and if anyone wants to have a great night out with family, please come here. I will definitely be back!!!
Also, try their carry out if you ever need a pizza and or sandwich on the go. Just call about a half hour before you get there and they will have it ready for you!"

We placed our order at 2 p.m. to be ready at 3 p.m. because we had limited time for lunch.  We got there at 2:55 and told the host we pre-ordered.  He took us over to a booth that was dirty and he was wiping the table with a few napkins as we sat down.  The pizza was not ready until 3:15 and looked like they were pressured to put it together.  We ordered  half pepperoni and half sausage.  We also ordered mozzarella sticks.  The pizza came out late, and not as we ordered.  It was peperoni and sausage all mixed together over the entire pizza.  We did not receive the mozzarella sticks either.  We saw a sign that if we wanted more peanuts we cold pay $2 but we never received the first basket.  The taste of the pizza however was good.  That&#39;s why 2 stars.  If we went at a time where they were swamped we could understand how the pizza could be late and the order mixed up.  However, we were practically the only customers in there.  That&#39;s really unacceptable when there are so many other choices.  We had to rush through lunch and my husband had to return to work at 3:30.  If you can&#39;t handle a simple order to be ready then you should tell the customer that you won&#39;t prepare it until they arrive."

This was on a  busy Saturday night and the staff was stretched beyond what they could do. They stayed polite but they did not have time to be attentive, much less friendly. 

For groups like ours they offered a package that provided two hours worth of pizza for $12 per person with unlimited soft drinks. However if someone in the group did not want pizza they we&#39;re only allowed to opt out on the pizza if they said they had food allergies. So our people who were not pizza lovers had to say that they had food allergies in order to get a beef sandwich.  

In all, an uncomfortable experience."

Taxidermy aside (try not to look...) this is a total family joint! I love VP/P. They have individual pizzas for really cheap (perfect for pick up at work) and the pizza buffet is a steal. Reeally, they could charge a buck more. 

Yesterday I had a speed bump in my enjoyment of VP/P; I had the cheesy beef. It was chewy (the beef, not the cheese) as if it was old, and dry, not wet at all. I probably should have requested extra wet w/ peppers or something, but that would not have changed the non-tenderness of the meat. Not their specialty. 

As a sidenote for gluten-free folks. They have gluten-free crusts which are really good and crispy. You pay a little more, but oh, so good.

She grew up in Carpentersville home of the original Village Pizza. I even know all the sordid details of the fighting between Nick and Mr. Village or...whatever....maybe I&#39;m not so clear on the details. This &#34;new&#34; Village is a quick 20 minute drive down 90 for us and we go to meet up with the in-laws every so often and enjoy the insanity that is Village Pizza.

First of all there are peanuts EVERYWHERE. You will be covered in peanut dust by the time you leave. If you were planning on visiting someone allergic to peanuts after your meal you might want to change clothes first. Or get in one of those portable Outbreak sanitation units. Then there is the taxidermy on the walls. Now, I&#39;m not a fan of hunting or anything, but I believe the place is meant to look like a hunting lodge. Why it&#39;s not called The Lodge Pizza &amp; Pub is beyond me. It doesn&#39;t bother me that I&#39;m sitting underneath Bambi&#39;s mom while eating fried cheese sticks, but maybe it will bother you. 

Now the pizza, I have only ever had what they call &#34;double decker&#34; pizza. For years I wondered why it was called double decker when it seemed like a thin crust with a braided edge. Last night I decided to really study a slice and yes it does appear that there are 2 thin crusts braided together in this pizza. However don&#39;t expect anything close to a pan pizza or what I refer to as &#34;double dough&#34;. Double decker is a whole different beast. The pizza is good, lots of cheese, toppings are well and evenly distributed, and while I don&#39;t normally think about pizza sauce on anything but a Chicago style pizza, the sauce here is really tasty. 

Service is usually pretty good. The worst its ever been is having to wait for the check to be dropped off and just when I reached the boiling point the waitress showed up. Last night we went with a very large group and I think we were taken care of very well. So, if you&#39;re looking for some decent pizza at a decent price, in a very rustic setting stop by Village."

The place was not very busy, which is interesting because when the economy was better the parking lot was jammed. It just shows you how the economy has weeded out the bad places!

There were about 5 tables occupied when we were seated. The server was very friendly and seated us promptly.

We waited and waited and waited for our food. I thought they actually went to Italy to make our pizza. This was very frustrating because my wife was very hungry and it seemed like an eternity.

Finally, the pizza came and was hot. But, after closer inspection part of the dough was not even cooked. There was still flour covering part of the dough. I mean it&#39;s just pizza - how can you screw that up?!

It was cold in the place, as it seemed like they turned the heat off. This was not a deal breaker but the quality of the food was not what I would expect.

I don&#39;t think we will be returning, especially since there are a million other pizza places in the Chicago suburbs."

We were taken here with a group of 12 people and told the Pizza was amazing. The place is a giant log cabin with TV&#39;s, fish tanks, big party rooms and video games. Free peanuts are on the table and on the floor. The shells are everywhere. 

They ordered 4 of the Village mixes which includes Poppers, Mushrooms, Zucchini, Onion Rings, Cheese Sticks, w/Choice of
any two Sauces: Red, Ranch or Cheddar Cheese. We ordered house salads and 6 pizza&#39;s including cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and vegetable. 

The Village mix is all frozen and then deep fried. Heavy batter and tasteless. They cook it till it&#39;s hard as a rock on the outside and then mushy on the inside. The salad&#39;s we&#39;re obviously pre-made and sitting in the fridge all day. Mushy and some parts brown. Inedible.

So we figured the pizza is the main attraction. Think again. All of them came out cold with canned toppings. The Sauce and Mozzarella cheese sickening . Sauce out of a can and cheese that was stringy, tasteless and from a giant package. The dough itself tastes like cardboard. You&#39;ll get a better pizza from the frozen section of the supermarket near you. 

The servers are nice.  That&#39;s the best thing I can about this so called pizza place. Oh they do have a big free parking lot. Why anyone even thinks about eating here is beyond me. Kids are welcome but if you love them don&#39;t feed them here. Absolutely horrible."

We accidentally had @20 people 5 pm on a Saturday.  (I have a lot of cousins).  They weren&#39;t sure if they could handle our crowd but somehow made room.  And made us so welcome!  Our server was great, obviously a pro at reunions and crowds.  She even took pictures with several cameras.  And she did the camera routine at least twice.  That takes the review to a 5.

Ok, pizza.  I live downtown and am a big fan of Lou Malnati&#39;s thin crust.  And somehow this pizza crust was (gasp) better.  We had mushroom &amp; sausage and even the last piece of the middle had a nice almost crisp crust.  Amazing.

Ok, sandwiches.  Several beef sandwiches - they were good but when we asked for more juice they improved.  I didn&#39;t taste, just looked at smiles.

Great price, great food.  Super nice people working the dining room.

Accepts reservations for large groups - requests/requires, actually.

I&#39;d recommend getting there early, the parking lot was jammed!!"

First thing, the Yelp map is wrong, this is about a half mile north of I-90 on Randall on the west side of the road.

It&#39;s a log building design; there&#39;s a big fish tank in the entryway.  With mounted animal heads and antlers inside, it&#39;s reminiscent of Nicks which is south of here a few miles.  In fact, you rather feel like you&#39;re in &#34;Nick&#39;s North&#34; but it&#39;s not so over-the-top with the animals as Nick&#39;s is.  We did inquire about this while waiting for our appetizer and found it indeed is the same family, but there&#39;s no other connection.

So on to the food.  ICE-COLD BEER in frosted mugs started things off right.  We ordered cheese-bread as we were quite hungry and the menu advised a 20 minute wait for pizza.  The bread was excellent and had a great flavor.

We ordered the 14&#34; thin crust pizza, Canadian bacon with black olives and mushrooms.  When the pizza arrived and we had our first bite, we decided we may not return to Nick&#39;s again--this was a much better pizza!  It had a nice sauce with some deeper notes, great crust, nice amount of toppings.

Neither Village Pizza or Nick&#39;s will be known for being the best value around; indeed, with their largest pizza at 14&#34;, that&#39;s a rather scrawny size these days and only serves two hungry people.  But we will return occasionally for the great pizza when we want to eat out and have pizza that&#39;s a step up from the norm."

My drink glass never got empty before she had a refill there.  The pizza was good.  No complaints.  The interior of the restaurant itself is a bit austere.  A few stuffed animal heads here and there, which I personally find unappealing in a restaurant.  There&#39;s something strangely nausiating about seeing half of a dead animal carcass hanging over my table while eating.  No other decor for the most part.  There&#39;s just something missing there in terms of ambiance.  Doesn&#39;t affect the quality of the meal itself, but yet the place itself is generally boring after about 5 minutes.  

This is indeed a copycat of Nick&#39;s Pizza up in Crystal Lake (and other locations).  There is a family connection between the two establishments, but I understand there to be some hard feelings between the two factions, hence the separate business ventures.  If you close your eyes, the peanuts and the pizza are identical.  

All in all, good pizza and good service in a generally boring setting."

This location is alot bigger, a lot fancier and busier, but these people remember where they came from which is a single store front back in the day.  The menu is the same, the quality exquisite,  the memories, priceless.

Menu offers a little something for everyone and service is friendly and NOT PRETENTIOUS or silly like at some places along the corridor, I&#39;m just saying!
As a note, from my other review:
One of the last meals on earth my mom ate by coice was a Number 7.  Cheese Sausage and Mushroom.  Or it used to be,either way, that says alot doesn&#39;t it?

And such a beautiful building, surely this would really be top-notch pizza too.  I have to say I was disappointed.  The pizza was just ordinary, not bad but certainly nothing special.  I sure wish I could find a pizza place that still actually tosses their crusts.  I think this must be the only way to get the thin, crispy, bubbly crusts that make such a good base to a terrific pizza.  The crust at Village seems to be rolled out so it&#39;s pretty tough.  The sauce is good and the toppings are plentiful, but again, just nothing special.  I do enjoy the basket of peanuts to munch on while waiting for service, but be careful... we waited so long for service we were pretty full of peanuts and decided to go without an appetizer.  We haven given Village Pizza several tries thinking maybe it was an off night, but the marginal pizza and consistantly poor service has kept us from returning.

I caught a glimpse of the kitchen last night on the way out and it is immaculately clean.  The drinks are good and reasonably priced, the staff is friendly and helpful. Not a huge fan of the taxidermied (is that even a word?)animals but to be honest, it was several trips before I even noticed them.  Last night we ordered a lg with onions, green peppers and bacon.  It smelled SO good that I actually didn&#39;t eat immediately and just enjoyed leaning over and enjoying the sensory stimulation.  I noticed that they just put up this green awning walkway thing in front of the door (i assume for the wintertime) but everyone is hanging out in there and smoking so it stinks and you have to walk through it to get into the restaurant (and as a former smoker, the smell usually doesn&#39;t bother me).

We went there last night (a Thursday at 6:30) a group of 11.  They don&#39;t take reservations and we waited about 25 minutes.  I asked the server if we could put our pizza order in now so it will be ready when we get a table and she said &#34;No, we don&#39;t do that - it got too complicated and we made too many mistakes.&#34;  So we waited.  They finally put us in a 4-person booth and pushed a 4-person table next to it (with a highchair).  You do the math.  I called the hostess back over and told her we couldn&#39;t fit 11 people at an 8 person table. &#34;Oh, ok&#34; and found another table to push next to it.  As she was walking away the waitress grabs the hostess and starts yelling at her that she can&#39;t take our table and blah blah.  I thought, great - we&#39;re screwed.  Another waitress came by and did you know that the largest pizza they make is 14&#34;?  14&#34; think crust pizza would barely feed my husband.  We ordered 5 pizzas and still could have used a few more.  How stupid is that - this is a place with a party room and supposedly caters to large parties and the biggest pizza is 14&#34;?  Stupid.  The rest was fine, the pizza was ok.  We finally got out of there at 9:00 p.m."

And then we had the breaded mushrooms for an appetizer which were tasty.  For dinner he had the meatball sandwich which was very cheesy but just okay.  But the show stopper was the Village Special pizza that we had...it has sausage, mushroom, onion and green peppers and let me tell you, it is amazing!

Around 5-10 minutes later, we got seated and got a cup of nice warm coffee and ordered a stuffed french toast which had raspberry, cream cheese and bananas in it. Out of this world. 
Definitely recommend this place. After breakfast you can head over to Downtown Geneva to stroll around and window shop."

Having received not one, not two, but THREE 5 star reviews from my friend Pat E., Town House Books had some rather high expectations to live up to...

We arrived around 1:30 or so to find a short wait for a table on the back patio. There&#39;s no way our stroller would have fit in the dining room, and it was too gorgeous a day to spend inside, anyway. The hostess was clearly very busy with the lunch rush, but she was friendly in a not-overly-but-just-perfectly accommodating sort of way, which I very much appreciate. We hung out on a bench out front while we waited for a table, and my son was delighted by the trollies passing by. 

When we were led around back (literally around the corner in our case, since we had to enter through the special side gate to avoid the inside stairs and other awkwardness), we were given a perfect table and greeted by our server, who had the same matter of fact helpfulness as the hostess.

Here is what we ate: BLT + A (A is for avocado) and a cup of French onion soup for me, monte christo for my husband, and half a turkey berry sandwich and a cup of corn chowder for my son.* None of these foods were disappointing! The corn chowder was particularly tasty, creamy and well spiced, and I love that I could order my sandwich on pumpernickel. 

Dear me, how could I forget to mention beverages? I was so, so thrilled to find this on the drink menu: iced coffee (free refills). And some delicious iced coffee it was. I think I&#39;m still hyped from the free refill. My husband and son shared some lemonade, which was the perfect combination of lemony sweetness, and also free refills.

We enjoyed flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce for dessert (mmm, highly recommend), and my husband had a double shot espresso which he said was just to his liking.

It didn&#39;t dawn on me until later how reasonably priced this all was. Exceptional soup, sandwiches, drinks and desserts, all at prices less than those of a Panera. Thanks to the atmosphere and excellent staff, we had a relaxing time on the patio, which is not always easy to achieve when your dining companions are a tired three year old and a small baby who is trying desperately to steal the avocado from your sandwich.

*Can I just add, as a side note: one of the many wonderful things about having a three year old with a hearty appetite who will eat anything is that I get to order two meals, basically. If he has no strong opinions, I just get to pick whatever I want a bite of. Hooray!"

This cafe is located near downtown, but off the beaten path a bit. The dining area is surprisingly large and open, though, and being able to browse books afterwards is nice. What I loved, though, was the food.

I got a spinach turkey sandwich with fruits on the side. As it turns out they just serve Terra Chips if you want the chips, so I&#39;ll get those next time. And I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever gotten a sandwich that was as well put together as this one. The dill cheese was my favorite part of the sandwich, and all of the flavors just went well together. I was eating in a bookstore but could easily have been eating on a farm.

We also got the last piece of apple crumble pie, which was more or less half apples and half crumble, and 100% goodness. With crumbles that big, you know you&#39;re getting your daily serving of butter. But the apples weren&#39;t neglected either, with some soft bites and some crunchy apple bites -- definitely leave room for dessert.

We will visit this place again."

Everyone on Yelp seems to love this little cafe, but despite my best efforts, I just can&#39;t get a win out of it.

People rave about the sandwiches, so I have tried the Plain Jane Grilled Cheese, Tuna Herb. Egg Salad and Town House Turkey. All have been so-so. They certainly were not the best sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had (that honor, thus far, still goes to Panini Panini in Michigan City, IN). The bread was a bit dry and dull, and the sandwiches themselves could have used more &#34;guts.&#34; 

What keeps bringing me back are the desserts, as I had the most amazing blueberry pie the first time I visited Town House Cafe. I haven&#39;t seen it on the specials board since, but I have tried just about every other kind of cake/pie, including a rather tasteless flourless chocolate cake, buttermilk pie with spiced peaches, and blueberry crumble. All have been disappointing. I can find better desserts at The Sugar Path or All Chocolate Kitchen in Geneva.

The wait service at Town House Cafe has been hit or miss. On the one hand, my water glass never goes empty, and the waitstaff is usually willing to bring you a sample of soup if you are thinking about ordering a bowl. However, the waitstaff has a difficult time explaining what they like on the menu (which makes me think they haven&#39;t tried everything), and often doesn&#39;t come to check on you once you have your lunch (except to ask if you want &#34;dessert or the bill?&#34;).

What REALLY bothers me though is the noise level inside this cafe. It gets obnoxiously loud. I don&#39;t know if they need to replace the carpeting or install ambient noise, but something has to give because it&#39;s hard to hear the person you&#39;re sitting right next to. If given the choice, opt for the patio in the back of the restaurant. It may be hot, but at least you can converse!"

I also enjoyed my iced tea, the impeccable service and a bite of my husband&#39;s pumpkin pie.  Sigh of contentment to have found such a cool place.

My wife and I wanted to do breakfast but were sick of the typical IHOPS and greasy, large portioned breakfast chains. This place is decently nice on the dress scale, I definitely wouldn&#39;t go in sweatpants. But not dressy. ($$) The menu is very limited, probably only 3-4 things to choose from. Everything tasted very fresh, organic and full of flavor. It was a clean, healthy meal. I highly recommend the big bowl and the egg salad. The tea was delicious. They bring a teapot to your table.

Absolutely wonderful.  There was 3 of us and we each got something different and tried each others....bad idea! Now I don&#39;t know which one I liked better. We ended up taking dessert on the road with us for our 1hr 30min trip home. The flourless chocolate cake was delicious. The staff at both the cafe and book store was very nice and knowledgeable.

Very cute restaurant. Love the bookstore that is attached. There is so much to pick from! We ate in the back outside, and our server was very nice. I ordered the BLT and my mother ordered a 1/2 sandwich on pumpernickel and 1/2 salad with raspberry vinaigrette. All the food was delicious. Everything was fresh. My side of fruit was very fresh, and the vinaigrette was amazing! Definantly will be coming back."

My fiance and I went here for Sunday brunch.  Although, he thought the brunch menu had slim pickings, I thought it was just enough for this dainty cafe.  What it lacked in the number of items, it made up in taste!  The menu had that special quality... you know, when you just can&#39;t decide on one item because everything looks so tasty?  I thought it had a lot of unique items that you just can&#39;t find at any chain breakfast or brunch restaurant.

We both started with mimosas, which were very refreshing and came out in surprisingly large campaign glasses.  For my meal, I had the lunch combo with half town house turkey sandwich, a cup of chilled avocado and jalapeno soup, and a mixture of kettle potatoes and carrot chips!  One word: YUM.  I loved the union between the smoked mozzarella, roasted red onion, avocado, turkey, lettuce, and spicy mayo. Everything in that sandwich worked so well together!  The soup was an interesting combination and to be honest, I didn&#39;t finish it as a soup but actually as dipping sauce for my chips! Soup... dip... can&#39;t go wrong!  Oh, and speaking of chips... carrot kettle chips... freakin&#39; awesome!

I am very excited to go here again for lunch and perhaps peruse the book store more in depth.  Overall, I wish this place continued success! I love local businesses and this one deserves to stay open for years to come! :)"

Food: awesome.  We went in for brunch and everyone loved their dishes.  My mom&#39;s tuna was awesome.

Ambiance: this little gem is nestled in such a pretty little street in downtown St Charles, you just don&#39;t care about anything else.  

My only gripe was...things get kinda tight in here.  Their space is cramped and they do the best they can with it but it does get crowded.  

Concept: Brunch and Books!  Winning combination!  There is a super quaint bookstore attached to the restaurant you can browse while waiting.  There are antique shops, lots of beautiful spaces to explore in the area as well.  

Definitely worth the trip!"

Considering the lack of book stores and wine bars in the area, I was not expecting to find a place where I could partake of my two loves.

I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that this place included a nice book store and a small bar. Perfect!

It&#39;s obvious that the restaurant area is really geared toward those eating lunch or dinner, but if you are so inclined (as I was) they seem to accommodate patrons (me) that just want to read or study while have a coffee or wine. 

The only negative is that the shop closes pretty early on Sunday, but hey it&#39;s the burbs after all."

I ordered the small side salad and a create your own sandwich. The salad was huge and delish-fresh and the herb vinaigrette was tasty. The sandwich was also delicious-everything was fresh and the turkey was oven roasted, not pressed deli meat. All in all, a delicious meal in a charming environment."

Everything this place serves is delicious. I absolutely love everything I eat here- and it all feels so fresh and unique. They make everything in house here, and it just feels special. When I was here this time, I was having trouble deciding so I went with the half cold sandwich/half salad combo so I wouldn&#39;t have to pick just one thing. I had the club sandwich- and the homemade mustard they use is spicy and wonderful. I upgraded (for 1.50) to the salad of the house- totally worth it- pecans, dried cranberries, veggies, and a homemade spicy ranch- salad heaven! We also had the key lime pie for dessert (desserts change frequently here) and it was fantastic.

The cafe has a homey, friendly room with vintage memorabilia about authors and books on the walls.

Our group of five was seated promptly at a round table near an old-fashioned window looking out to the historic street area.  The soups of the day including a creamy potato and a tomato-basil, were very good and served in generous portions.  We also had nice gooey toasted cheese sandwiches on homemade bread.  Sadly, our schedule did not allow time for dessert -- the ladies I was with were on a shopping mission.  So I missed fresh berry cobbler, a cheesecake and several other delicious-sounding items.

My friend had recommended we go there as he had been there several times and always enjoyed the food. We also figured it would be a perfect place to eat before we hit some of the local stores in the area. This area of St. Charles is a great place to shop for truly unique items and to help support our local store owners....

While we waited for our table we went into the bookstore and found several books that caught our attention, and was amazed by the selection that they had available.  When it was our time to eat we sat at the counter. We were able to watch so many wonderful looking deserts be made that we were like oh my this isn&#39;t good we may have to skip the meal and go right to desert.  However, we stayed strong and had a wonderful meal. I had the eggs benedict and their side of potatoes both had a wonderful flavor. My friend had a sandwich, that he says he always gets. He said it is one of his all time favorites. He said he has also had their house salad and it is out of this world as is their banana cream pie.

While we were waiting for our food they brought out a fresh flour less chocolate cake, that looked vary tasty. I however, said I&#39;m standing firm and having the raspberry pie to go....Let me just tell you when I had that with my dinner that evening not only was the raspberry filing wonderful so was the crust. I shocked myself and eat all the crust which is unheard of for me. My kudos to the baker, I want them here at my place making pies.....

While we were there I took a peak at their non Sunday menu and found several items that I would enjoy so I know I have to go back and try other items. 

I highly recommend this place to you. I also noticed they had wine for those that like a glass of wine with their meal.  I have to say the wait staff was not only prompt they were friendly and they seem to keep the place going. I know I will be popping back into this wonderful local place to try a few more things and to get more of that pie...."

I was living in Kentucky at that point, and desperately looking to move north. Thankfully, I found the interview, I got the job in Geneva and moved a couple months after that fated drive-through, and in the meantime had been looking up information on St Charles left and right, so stoked I was to be moving there. Town House Books was one of the many charming places that drew me to the Fox Valley.

I no longer live in Kane County, but this is one of those places that makes me miss that area. A wonderful little bookstore with a great collection and super-helpful staff, combined with an awesome little breakfast/lunch/brunch spot that has delicious food, wine, and great coffee? Yes, PLEASE.

Both sandwiches tasted amazing, well balanced and flavorful to the last bite. We also had dessert and coffee. Pretty much any dessert is great. They&#39;re all fresh and limited in supply, so get what you want while the getting&#39;s good.  was also pleased to find that the coffee wasn&#39;t your typical burnt flavor as it is at most brunch places.

The space of the bookstore is full of interesting things to see, along with how the books were placed.

I came here today originally to check out the bookstore, but I couldn&#39;t resist trying the Sunday brunch hours. I got myself a pot of hot-pressed  Safari Sunset tea (the aroma is delightfully yummy and spicy...makes me think of Autumn!), and the lunch combo of Sweet Potato Bisque and Egg Salad Sandwich. The presentation of the food was quite awesome with the colorful root chips! Overall they were all delicious! I was told all of the food were homemade, and I can certainly taste it in the cooking~ The prices are in a reasonable range for me, since my meal just came up to $10.

It&#39;s not that Tacos aren&#39;t great, (they are... as appetizers!) it&#39;s just that the savage carnivore within me requires satiation in the quantitative form, the MASS quantitative form, preferably smothered in steaming hot Chihuahua cheese and loaded with enough protein to damn near shut down my lower intestines. 
That&#39;s why I frequent Grande Jake&#39;s. They understand the importance of over-sized indulgence, and they pair it, appropriately, with a salsa bar and endless tortilla chips. 
The stuff dreams are made of. (if you&#39;re a glutton like me) 
This is why I recommend you abandon all attempts at social conformity, and cast your pride aside to dine in. It&#39;s also why I recommend wearing comfortable, stretchy attire, suitable for the expansion which a football sized burrito will cause. You may also want to consider rolling up any sleeves (or forgoing sleeves) as that cheesy layer of deliciousness can create an oily mess on any fabric it encounters. 
Napkins are your friend, unless you&#39;re purposely trying to save some for later.
So, fellow yelpers, go, go to Grande Jake&#39;s, and double your meat order on that giant burrito. Take a journey through the many flavors of the Salsa bar, and enjoy the colorful dining room while you become one with that delicious, cheese smothered treasure."

It is counter service, the guy taking the orders was friendly, I placed my order for the Carne Asada cooked medium rare, and salad instead of rice and beans, plus a small side of guac and proceeded to wait at my booth. The chips and salsa were promptly delivered to my table, the chips were warm and colorful with a perfect delicious crunch and flavor and the 2 salsas served with the chips were very good, one had a smoky flavor, and the other one more tomato-e. 

There is a help yourself salsa bar with lots to choose from, I tried the mango salsa which was delicious and a green mild salsa which was watery and lacking flavor. My food arrived, and the steak looked great but it was obvious that Grande&#39;s specialty is not salads, there was a bit of chopped lettuce, some not so great looking tomato and a few strips of green and pepper on it, plus it was a very small side, I always say that if they can&#39;t do it right they shouldn&#39;t do it at all, oh well, I was just happy the steak looked so good, that is until I took a bit, the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, however it had no flavor, totally lacked any seasoning, very surprising as Carne Asada is usually well marinated and full for flavor, luckily the guacamole was fresh and very tasty.

Service was friendly, however I found it very disruptive that there were several ladies cleaning the restaurant, basically right next to me, as I sat in my booth trying to enjoy my dinner there was a lady vacuuming right next to me, and others moving the chairs around and sweeping, it felt like i was in the way, now mind you this is 2 hours prior to them closing, I totally understand if they were cleaning tables and wiping them down, but they were doing a move everything and deep clean, sweep and vacuum, not exactly the environment you want to be in while trying to enjoy dinner.

Chips/Salsa/Guac - 5 stars
Carne Asada - 2.5 stars
Experience - 2 stars"

Yes, just 8 minutes and you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re in Pilsen!

With a Wide array of fresh salsa - at least 10 to 12 different types! Nice sized and tasty tacos - steak, chicken, barbacoa, fish (tilapia is adequate), ground beef - are all very good. Velvety refried beans and the rice is decent. 

Friendly service and very good Mexican food considering you&#39;re close to Schaumburg. 

Complimentary chips and the once again - a wide array of fresh salsa makes Grande Jakes a great stop after a shopping trip or putting up with the 100 miles of construction on I-90."

She recommended the burrito, so since today is Wednesday and the special is the Mas Grande Burrito, I said let&#39;s give it a go! I got steak and chorizo in it.

The service was pretty good. Food was quick coming out. The waitress who delivered the guacamole stood there and waited til we tried it to make sure we like it which I thought was good.

On to the burrito. It was humongous! I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever had a burrito as big. The taste was ok. The sauce covering the burrito wasn&#39;t bad; good flavor but I felt there could&#39;ve been a little more sauce. The meat on the inside was seasoned well. The problem is that the condiments weren&#39;t evenly distributed. One side of my burrito was all lettuce. The other side was all meat. Everything else was in the middle. So one bite was all lettuce, the next was all meat.

I&#39;m willing to return here but I&#39;ll likely try something else other than the Mas Grande Burrito."

I ordered the fresco burrito, and found it to be just okay.  I realized it was missing the avocado that it was supposed to have and it was only when I requested some that they admitted that they were out of it. Disappointing, but honestly I don&#39;t think it would have made much of a difference.  The format of the restaurant was also confusing- we ordered at the counter but then we were sort of waited on as if it were a restaurant.  The waitress came up to us and asked if we wanted to pay (as we hadn&#39;t at the counter; we were maybe considering ordering another beer).  She didn&#39;t hand us the check or even tell us how much we owed, but instead waited as we stopped our conversation to pull out a credit card to pay; kind of awkward. The enchiladas were pretty good, we both enjoyed them."

I walked in right at the start of lunch time, there was a group of 6 in front of me and a group of 4 behind me. You walk in and place your order at the front, they give you a number and you wait for them to bring you your food. There are a lot of options on their menu including lunch specials. 
I went with the enchiladas suizas lunch special. It came with two enchiladas, rice and beans. While I waited for my food I got served chips and salsa, yum. They offered two types of salsa, one which is served hot. Both were very mild and absolutely delicious. They have a salsa bar also but I didn&#39;t check that out on my visit. 
My food came out rather quickly. I was surprised that it came so fast considering how busy they were. In a manner of minutes the restaurant was completely full. 
Ok so my enchiladas have to be some of the best I&#39;ve had in a long time. The steak was tender, full of flavor and there was plenty of it. The red sauce tasted home made and fresh and they added just the right amount of cheese. The beans were good and the rice was made the way I like it, with peas and carrots. I washed my meal down with a fantastic horchata. 
The restaurant isn&#39;t too big but it&#39;s decorated nicely in lively bright colors, the employees were very friendly and they have an out door seating area. Oh they also serve alcohol. 
I will be back real soon and I&#39;m excited to try some of the other things in their menu."

We ordered at the counter, got our drinks at the drink station, had unlimited complementary chips and salsa by the time we sat down, quickly got our meals and thoroughly enjoyed them!

There was a line at the counter where you order when we arrived. It was rather slow moving so we ended up waiting for a little while longer than I would have liked. They have a fairly traditional Mexican-American menu and some Tex-Mex items. On my son&#39;s suggestion, I order a steak burrito. I would classify it as akin to Chipotle&#39;s burritos. They are quite large and very filling.

The really nice thing about Grande Jake&#39;s is their bottomless bowl of multi-colored tortilla chips and their salsa bar. I like the hotter sauces, and they had several of them. I can&#39;t say I liked all of the different ones, but I did find a few to keep me happy.

I&#39;ve got to say I was pleasantly surprised!  I liked their salsa bar, and they had Cerviche as a special appetizer, which was delicious.  I had soft-shell tacos Mexican-style and they were very good. Bottom line...the food was very good.

The service was also very friendly and prompt.    You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you.

My company is moving me to an office that&#39;s about 200 yards from this location in March.

This is what Mexican grills should be. So let&#39;s get to the food:

Chorizo enchilada with Mole -- anytime I see mole on the menu, I have to try it out. This mole was just a little bit sweet, and went really well with the crumbly, greasy, surprisingly flavorful chorizo. I liked the rice and refried beans as well, both scratchmade and authentic (well, authentic enough for my taste buds). Plus I had more than enough for leftovers.

My wife had a chicken quesadilla, which she liked, but I didn&#39;t actually taste it.

Fried ice cream -- because the owner himself suggested I buy a Groupon good for $20 worth of food, we ended up getting a fried ice cream. This was excellent; not so much the vanilla ice cream, but the crispy fried bread it was served on top of. It&#39;s like having the best parts about a churro and an ice cream combined.

Free chips! And more importantly, free salsa - there&#39;s a mango one that&#39;s quite good, but all of them were bright, fresh and spicy.

And everyone there was very friendly and helpful, making sure you were taken care of and answering any questions you might have about the food. It&#39;s the perfect lunch spot for everyone in and around Schaumburg."

Horrible, canned food. Not fresh, canned. Huge portions,  but nothing you want to eat, so,  what is the point? Nachos had canned cheese sauce and canned refried beans. We should have stopped right there,  but we decided to share a wet burrito. After the first bite, we sent it back.

Yuck again!"

Yesterday was Cinco de Mayo, is there a better time to try a new Mexican place? We arrive for a late lunch so we were able to beat most of the crowd. We walked in and ordered our lunch and found a a booth to sit. The counter service was quick and very friendly. The wait staff was also very nice and checked in on us regularly.

Portion size was good for lunch and the food was hot and very tasty. It was a little pricey for lunch but the atmosphere made up for it."

Despite the lackluster location (on New Wilke, off the main road, Golf Road) this place was rather busy. The setup is a semi-dine-in, meaning, you order at the front, you get a number, and then a server brings your food and whatever you might ask. They serve warm chips with salsa as you wait for your food, which comes out pretty fast.

They have a decent variety at their salsa bar. From super hot habenero to mango salsa, they have several choices.

I ordered the chicken fajitas. It had peppers, onions, chicken, and was seasoned really nicely. It came with a generous amount of corn tortillas (flour, if you want them). The waitresses there were super friendly and nice.

Two things were strange in that they told my wife she couldn&#39;t get the fajitas dish with chicken, although I was able to get a chicken enchilada.  Also the sour cream is an extra which wasn&#39;t even mentioned when we ordered the fajita lunch special for 8.50.

Good quality Mexican food.  We had a little bit of everything (burittos, fajitas, tacos, etc).
Above and beyond the steak was impressive.  Seasoned, tender, it actually blew me away.  The black beans and re-fried beans you could tell were fresh as well as the pico de gallo and lettuce.  The portions were big so take that how you want, I always like it, but some people may not.

I had the burrito dinner which was three small burritos so i tried one chicken (yummy) one spinach (yummy) and one ground beef (only had one bite).  The beans were really delicious!  Rice was average.  My husband had tacos and wasn&#39;t thrilled cuz two of them were ground beef.  They didn&#39;t drain the beef so it was super soggy and the soaked tortilla fell apart.  The steak taco was better.  Overall decent but not the best.  There is a salsa bar with awesome salsas.  The spicy is very spicy just the way it should be. The service was great.  Super friendly.

I&#39;ve tried most of the burritos, the nachos, and the tamales over my extensive visits, and you&#39;d be hard pressed to find something you won&#39;t love.

The (Perhaps) owner, Is always very friendly and customer service oriented. On many occasions he&#39;s offered me a fountain drink on the house. I usually place my order to go, and I&#39;ve got it bagged and ready to go in about 5 minutes. Once while waiting for our carry out order, The owner invited my friend and I to have a seat, and we were brought out warm tortilla chips with salsa while we waited, even though we weren&#39;t dining in.

I had a taste for steak tacos and GJ&#39;s didn&#39;t disappoint. I was happy to see they had two options for the steak tacos, American style (cheese, sour cream an so on) and Mexican style (cilantro and onions). I&#39;m a fan of the Mexican style, the cheese and sour cream is too heavy for me. I really liked the hot salsa that was served with the chips, it&#39;s pretty bland, but remember I&#39;m a white guy....

The only compliant I had was the patio, or should I say lack of an inviting one. It was a beautiful 75 degree and sunny evening and I wanted to sit outside, but the patio sucks. They have a really good sized area for outside seating, most restaurants would kill to have that space. Basically, they have 5ish black iron tables sitting there and that&#39;s it, not very inviting or cozy at all. It was pretty crowded inside and not 1 table outside. First off, it&#39;s very sunny there at 6pm, get some umbrellas. Secondly, look 20 feet north at the chicken roasters patio, it&#39;s the same size but feels cozy. Section it off, get umbrellas, put some nice flower pots out there, pump music out there, etc.

Also, it&#39;s a nice place and seems family friendly, lose the cheesy Mexican beer signs and standup cardboard cut outs of the Mexican beer girls. Class it up a bit and you&#39;ll keep the rich white suburban families coming in. Leave the cheesy beer advertising to the dumpy liquor store down the street."

We are picky with what steak and carnitas we like and we really enjoyed both there. We told everyone about the place! We have since learned that this place is REALLY hit or miss! The consistency just isn&#39;t there! The ground beef NEVER seems to have been drained which causes the tacos to fall apart, carnitas are now sometimes too wet with just too much juice, and sometimes the burritos have WAY too much of one ingredient like the cheese, which ruins the burrito all together! We have been trying to order the flan there since our first visit and although it&#39;s on their menu, they do not have it and the owner keeps saying they are &#34;just focusing on the food for now.&#34; Geez! Take it off the menu if you never plan to have it! After my last visit, I&#39;m prolly not going to go back any time soon! I ordered pork tamales &amp; they were terrible!! They were extremely dry &amp; had way too much cornmeal! I have eaten a lot of tamales in my day and aside from canned tamales (no thank you) these were by far the worst! I told the waitress and then the guy at the cash register tasted them and agreed they were very dry. I would have rather just been given something else but they insisted on making me a new tamale dinner! By the time it arrived, my husband was finished eating! The second dish was not nearly as dry, but they still were not good! The sour cream I ordered was way too runny &amp; my beans had a strange tangy can like taste so I could not even disguise the taste of my tamales.  I barely ate anything and I was really disappointed. They never checked on us again so we just left! I paid for a $10.95 tamale dinner plus tip and I left hungry and annoyed only to come home and eat left over mac n cheese! That was 40 mins I can&#39;t get back and $14 in the trash!

I came here for my standard &#34;taco Thursday&#34; stop; deciding to try a new place this week.  I believe they opened this location right around Christmas time.  There is another in Buffalo Grove and somewhere else.  

Being &#34;taco Thursday&#34; I ordered two tacos and had to try the advertised hand rolled tamale.  One taco steak and the other carnitas on soft corn shells.  The shells were okay a bit tough.  The meat on the tacos were flavorful.  The steak not as flavorful as Los Compandres&#39;.  I really did enjoy the food though, and please realize I am really picky about tacos.  The tamale had really good flavor, but seems quite dry to me.  Not sure if it was sitting out for a time or something.  I will try another, just to make sure it wasn&#39;t a bad one.  

The star of the show is there salsa bar.  There are around 12 different salsas most or all which seem freshly made.  The ones I tried I really, really liked.  

I went back today (a few days after my first time) and tried steak and al pastor tacos.  The al pastor was excellent.  The steak was the same as before, good NOT greasy, but could use a bit more flavor (imo).  

Solid four stars.  I am glad they are close to work and home as I see this as a place to get a quick bite or full on meal.  Tacos are $2.85 each, which at first I thought was expense, but they are large and worth the price.  Oh and if you eat there the will bring you chips too."

When we moved to Schaumburg, we started going to the Rolling Meadows location all the time and it was great - the past 2 times we have been there - they have gotten the order wrong with the new cashier and the steak was AWFUL cold and fatty this week when we went there.  The corn tortillas were also very soggy.  Very disappointed as this is our fave mexican spot but after the past couple times I&#39;m wondering if this location is starting to go down hill a bit.

The police know all the best eats, so I did an illegal u-turn and gave this place a shot.  Glad I did!
I had three different types of tacos, one too many for lunch at this place (portions are large). The quality of food was very good, salsa bar is awesome, Coke products in the fountain (though no Zero), and a friendly staff.  
I don&#39;t know where the cut-off for the $$ rating comes from. Maybe this place is priced slightly higher than your typical burrito-spot; however, you can get a decent meal for 8 bucks, and you will not mind the slightly higher price considering all you get in return.
I will put this place into my regular lunch rotation and drive by two other taco places on the way there."

It&#39;s hard to find good Mexican food in the burbs, so it makes me appreciate this place a little more.  I&#39;m always happy when I find good Mexican food:)

Also, the customer service is awesome here!  They are so friendly, welcoming, helpful, and attentive.  Yet, they are not a normal sit down restaurant, which is fine with me.  They just really value customer service and it&#39;s evident that they have such great management here.  It&#39;s really refreshing every time I come here, because as soon as I walk in the door, I&#39;m instantly in a good mood. 

I loved their salsa bar too!  They are all fresh and there&#39;s something for everyone there, as there are so many choices.  Every Mexican place should have this feature...it&#39;s genius!  And it&#39;s self-service, which I love.  It&#39;s a no-brainer to me:)

Overall, I thought the portions were good too.  I have two complaints, which prevented me from giving this place 5 stars.  The first is, that, they barely give me any rice with my entree.  The amount of beans is fine, but the amount of rice I&#39;ve been given, is equivalent to about one tablespoon worth.   

The other issue was, that, their chips taste like they come from a bag.  There&#39;s food coloring used to make some of the chips red etc.  When I eat tortilla chips, I want them to taste home-made and not like they&#39;re bought from a store and colored with additives.  That&#39;s a huge reason why I like to go to Mexican restaurants, because I love home-made chips and salsa.  If I wanted store-bought tortilla chips, I would eat them at home.  

Those are the only 2 reasons I didn&#39;t give a higher ranking.  If they fixed those things, I&#39;d give it a 5 star, without hesitation....but those are pretty big deals to me, considering I have a lot to compare it to and because rice and tortilla chips are a staple at any Mexican restaurant. UPDATE: I do not recommend getting take out....the portions are much smaller, than when you dine in. that&#39;s unacceptable and there&#39;s no legit reason to do that.  I find that to be shady, so I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll give them my business anymore.  I&#39;d rather give my business, to places that are fair and give the same portion, whether you&#39;re getting take out or dining in, which I&#39;ve have no problem finding."

We finished up our business trip early so we headed over here for a lunch.  Thankfully, it wasn&#39;t too packed, but by the time we got our food the line had grown.  I opted for the chili cheese dog, cheese fries and the chocolate cake milkshake.  Yeah, way too much food but it was stupid good of course.  The dog had a nice snap and was covered in a messy amalgam of hearty chili and cheese sauce.  And the cheese fries were on point...exactly what you&#39;d think they&#39;d be...fries with a cup of wonderful, melty, plastic-y cheese for dipping.

And the shake...I was told I wouldn&#39;t be able to finish it but I had to order it, kind of a right of passage.  The cake is apparently super moist because they add mayonnaise to the batter.  It does not change the taste at all, but makes the cake dense and almost fudgy.  Blend it up in a shake and you have something that you almost burst a blood vessel in your forehead trying to get up the straw.

This ended my Chicago food trifecta.  And it&#39;s definitely a trilogy I would do again."

There will be other places for Italian Beef I told myself as I started to chow down. It was all so very good! The Chicago Dogs were just how I like them and rivaled the street vendors I&#39;ve had in the past. The fries were nice and crisp with a nice saltiness that was complimented by the cheese sauce. 

I&#39;m sure locals just see Portillo&#39;s as an everyday fast food joint but for an out of towner like myself this was a really a treat.  I can&#39;t wait to comeback and try more of the menu. Maybe next time I&#39;ll go for the Beef and find a Dog elsewhere."

I visited this location on Sunday, September 18th about 4pm.  Can&#39;t give the exact time as they conveniently did not give me a receipt.  Oh, the oh so charming staff, did provide a &#34;survey receipt&#34; which oddly does not match the dollar amount on my credit card. 

The line in the drive through was not too long, yet the time was insane.  That should have been my immediate clue to leave. It was a sign of the total incompetence of this location.  Here is what I ordered:

1 Regular Beef, no peppers, Extra, Extra, Extra, Extra Juicy
1 Big Beef, no peppers, Extra, Extra, Extra, Extra, Extra juicy
1 hot dog, everything but peppers
1 Strawberry Shortcake
Extra Gravy for both Beefs, as no matter how many times you tell them to drown it, it is still not wet enough for our tastes.

After the extensive repeating of the order, I snaked through the line of 2 cars in front of me. After all this time in line, a worker appears outside to repeat the order and take the payment.  My hot dog was not on the order, so it gets added and he gives me this BS story of how they double check to make sure the item is on the order and gets charged. He says often times its there but you don&#39;t get charged.  I laugh, Portillo&#39;s has never failed to charge me, more likely charge and fail to deliver.

When  I finally make it to the window to collect the food, the &#34;charming&#34; clerk hands me the bag, with the beefs, hot dog and shortcake in one plastic bag, but the shortcake is touching the beef, why???

I look in the bag and find one tiny container half full of gravy and ask for more. After waiting nearly five minutes, a very rude woman who must have been pretending to be a manager, pops her head out of the window and hands me a larger container, again half full, and tells me they are not supposed to do this, blah, blah.  If you would give me what I ordered, I would not have to ask for it.

When I arrived home, as usual the beef were not wet enough.  The hot dog tasted old and stale, there was no &#34;snap&#34; at the first bite.  

I would strongly advise anyone to stay away from this location. I suggest whomever owns, &#34;manages&#34; or benefits financially from this location, take the time to educate and train your staff on customer service."

And rarely cook meat at home. I save it as an indulgence for outside the home. Being Yelp minded and thinking to eat local when road dawging it, I made Portillo&#39;s my annual &#34;have a bite of hot dog&#34; stop. The hot dogs here were so good I had more than that!

We ordered two plain dogs and thanks to the reviews on Yelp, I went for a chili cheese dog too. We hadn&#39;t even got our supplies from the condiment station when our number was called. I like that!

The dogs and the poppy seed buns went down fast! And no tummy upset so I figure Portillo&#39;s uses quality meat. For $2.85 per dog, they better be!

Chili had beans in whole form that I could see! I like that rather than something ground down to mush. It was not sloppy, which I was afraid of. I would get this again even though it&#39;s far outside my usual chow.

Fries were nothing special to speak of. Crinkles from a freezer bag. Hot, but not salted. I added.

The cashiers state that the receipt has a survey (which we filled out as soon as we got home) for free food, so you know they aim to serve if they push that from the get go. I saw a diverse workforce here.

The decor is awesome! I felt like I could use the diner vibe to sell others on coming here. It&#39;s my favorite look in a restaurant. Authentic and not kitschy. 

It is a &#34;busy&#34; look. Finding the order taker took a minute. When faced with a standing crowd, go straight back!

It&#39;s cool how the expo person has sassy rhymes to call out along with the order number! 

Mid afternoon, the dining room tables could have been cleaner but someone was changing trash so I give the benefit of the doubt he/she was working toward it and won&#39;t deduct a star. Bathrooms were clean.

Having been to the downtown location when doing business in the area in the past, I will definitely make it a point to adjust our &#34;road food&#34; stops to include this location, and you should too. In/out and parking was easy. This is super easy to get to off of the interstate and is well worth the stop rather than taking a typical fast food option that is visible from the exit.

I&#39;ve been eating Portillo&#39;s since I was a wee child and it is engrained in my blood. Everything they have is delicious, from the Italian beef (get it dipped and with peppers!), their hot dogs, and their burgers. I love their Maxwell Polish sausage, with grilled onions and mustards (like a brat). Their chopped salad is also very popular if you&#39;re more in the mood for a salad. Their chili cheese dogs are great, as are their plain hot dogs. They serve quality burgers that will make you want to come back for more! Their fries are delicious and my family is a huge fan of getting cheese fries. In addition, they have the best shakes and malts, especially considering malts are hard to come by nowadays! One of their shakes is called the chocolate cake shake where they take a slice of their chocolate cake and mix it into their shake... It&#39;s very hit or miss with people because the texture is weird, but I personally really like it!

The star of the show for sure is their chocolate cake. So much so that I need to write about it in a separate paragraph. Portillo&#39;s chocolate cake is the best cake you will ever eat in your life. I&#39;ve been requesting this cake for my birthday for years and years, and it never lets me down.

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything here that I tried that I didn&#39;t like. That said, I haven&#39;t been here in months, but somehow I ended up here with 3 other people today. We were all starving. 

Instead of ordering my usual chopped salad with onion rings, I ordered a combo (beef &amp; sausage) with hot peppers and cheese fries. YUM! Maybe I was just super hungry but it was seriously soooooooo good. 

For the first time ever, I got the dip (on the side) and I&#39;m glad I did. It was really good. Not salty like other dips I&#39;ve had. It had a mushroom flavor. It was a nice addition to the combo and didn&#39;t overpower anything.

The other people I was with got the combo, bacon cheeseburgers, cheese fries, and onion rings. Yes, I tried some onion rings. I can&#39;t help it. It&#39;s hot, crispy, fried goodness. 

I think next time I&#39;ll try the ribs. People have been telling me it is the best ribs they&#39;ve ever had."

In the last week I have been by twice. Both times ordering an Italian beef w sweet peppers. The first time the Italian beef lacked flavor. I didn&#39;t mind this much as sometimes this may happen. Although uniformity in your product should be key. The second time I came by was about 5 days later. I ordered the exact same thing yet this time when I brought it home the Italian beef I bit into was nothing but fat. Each piece seem to be sliced from a fatty piece of meat in which I could not even bite through the sandwich. The resulting in all of the meat being fed to my dog. I have always been a fan of Portillo&#39;s however since the new ownership the quality has plummeted. I am sadly disappointed and no longer a fan."

I know this stuff is terrible for me, but I&#39;m from Villa Park, where the original Portillo&#39;s Dog House stand all began, so *technically* I&#39;m eating local whenever I eat the garbage pile of food that I consumed here tonight... which sadly, doesn&#39;t happen often. 

And please don&#39;t PM me about America&#39;s obesity problem. Or about how fast food is killing the nation. Or about how not only do you not eat fast food, but you don&#39;t even have a microwave. Congrats to you. Have a cookie... for everyone who cares... which leaves you with exactly zero cookies. PS, your pious is showing.

Tonight I had 4 large orders of fries, 2 cups of melt-y cheese, and a chocolate cake shake for dinner... because I&#39;m an adult and I can do that. Also because my life partner is out of town and this is the way I choose to fend for myself... and it makes me happy. It really does. He doesn&#39;t understand. It reminds me of growing up in Villa Park, it reminds me of my family, it reminds me how much I love food, and even though my pants feel a size of two tighter and I needed to take an emergency nap after eating just a quarter of my order, it reminds me that there are much worse things I could be than unhealthy. 

I mean, unhealthy isn&#39;t a goal of mine, but honestly, I&#39;m over the war on unhealthy and personally, feel that my time is much better spent elsewhere, fighting the war on unhappy. I can think of a million things that are worse to be than fat, and unhappy is right up there at the top of the list. If you&#39;re an adult, you should stay tuned to what makes you happy. What would you do if there was no one around to judge you or tell you what&#39;s right or wrong? I&#39;d eat a shit ton of Portillo&#39;s cheese fries. It&#39;s a simple thing. So simple, in fact, that I can see where it might even be a little sad, but for whatever reason, to me it&#39;s not. 

This was actually the second Portillo&#39;s I visited today. I&#39;d originally gone to one up the road from here (that was actually closer to me) and convinced myself that I should feel guilty for going and I as I sat in the looong drive through line (even at 8:30 in the evening) waiting for the guys in yellow safety vests to take my ridiculous order. Then, as I got closer to approaching the order people, I got a phone call from my Andres D, and I decided to take it as a sign that I shouldn&#39;t be eating this way since I wouldn&#39;t be able to both talk to Andres and place my order with the drive-thru man at the same time, so I turned the wheel and decided to leave my spot in the drive-thru queue and go somewhere healthier. Maybe Whole Foods. 

And then I got to talking to Andres, who&#39;s absolutely one of the kindest, sweetest, happiest guys I know - also a lover of fast food - and told him what just happened with my feeling guilty and leaving the drive-thru and what my order wsa going to be, and the first thing he said was, &#39;Mark is out of town again, isn&#39;t he?&#39; and the second was something along the lines of &#39;Treat yo se&#39;f!&#39;... so I did. Because he&#39;s right.

So while I continued to discuss not-so-urgent life matters with Andres, I found myself at another Portillo&#39;s location just up Golf Road and I couldn&#39;t help but laugh as I placed my order with the girl standing outside the drive thru lines. I honestly couldn&#39;t hold it in. So much so that I felt bad, because I started to feel like either the girl who was taking my order would think I was having a go at her, or that I was on something, so I apologized and just explained that I wasn&#39;t laughing at her, I was laughing because all that food was for me. All of it. And i just had to laugh. She didn&#39;t judge. Just smiled and told me I could move up in line. Sweet thing. 

When I finally got up to the window to pick up my cake shake and food, the girl handed me a cake shake with no straw and I was like thinking, &#39;what the sh*t is this?&#39;, so I calmly asked for a straw and she replied that the straw was inside my bag with all my fries. 

WHY U DO DIS TO ME, PORTILLO&#39;S? 

You know damn well that no one orders a cake shake and leaves without sucking half of it down before they get of the parking lot. It&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to make searching for the cake shake straw the new texting and driving. 

Also, my fries here weren&#39;t the freshest... which was sad since I&#39;d gotten an almost literal boatload of them, but ain&#39;t no thang for me because I&#39;ve got a damn fine microwave that was more than happy to assist in saving my happiness, er, dinner. i mean dinner."

I really dislike theme &amp; retro décor and boy did this place have it, big time. Seems most locations have some kind of kitschy theme, ugh.  But I wasn&#39;t here for that as much as I was for a hot dog &amp; an Italian beef.

We didn&#39;t have to wait too long to order, a couple minutes at the walk up counter and about 5 more minutes for the food.  I chose a booth; he waited up front for the food.

We ordered and shared one of each:
1. Italian beef, dipped then topped with sweet peppers &amp; spicy giardiniera - I love a good beef dip and a dipped Italian seems to be the Chicago equivalent.  Ya gotta eat the fully dipped Italian beef really fast here because the bread can&#39;t hold up to much au jus before it becomes a soggy mess - not what I&#39;m used to.  The flavor was good and I love the spicy giardiniera.  I coulda eaten a whole one! But I still had the next thing to try...

2. Hot dog with everything (except sport peppers): mustard, relish, chopped onions, sliced tomatoes and pickle  on a poppy seed bun (of course!) - Oh the snap of that dog when I bit into it with all the flavors melding together!  It was a little bit of heaven.  The warm hot dog and the cold condiments all went together perfectly.

3. French fries - I love crinkle cut fries but you rarely see them out here in So Cal anymore.

They get my A-ok...solid comfort food."

I hardly ever come here (only because it&#39;s not that good for you...but it tastes great!!), but when I do I go all out. Give me everything you have. Chocolate cake shake, a burger, and cheese fries. And they have wayyyyy more than that. Beefs, hot dogs, salads, soups, you name it! And the chocolate cake...seriously the best (they put mayo in it...no wonder). We have catered from this location for work events, and they are always great about packing things up neatly, helping us out to the car, and being on time (and of course the taste).

I prefer this location over the one down the street on Golf. This one is much smaller, but the atmosphere is awesome - I feel like I have gone back in time to the 1950&#39;s and The Fonz could walk through the door at any moment. And they still have a drive-though (but they don&#39;t need the cops to direct traffic). The parking situation is a bit crowded, but I have always been able to find a spot."

Dick Portillo did a great job of crafting the gold standard for diners in the Chicago region and beyond. As soon as you step through the front door you are instantly taken back in time to the colorful, neon lights of the 60&#39;s with old movie posters and signs classically adorning the tile walls. While you&#39;re eying the decor, your auditory system will be pleasantly treated to the sounds of decades past music that will even put the brattiest of Chicago-born children in a good mood. When you approach the counter, you will overwhelmed with a plethora of food options, ranging from large flame-broiled burgers to classic Chicago dogs and heaping Italian beef sandwiches.  Although the prices no longer reflect those of yesteryear, they are very competitive for the quality and quantity of food you receive.  I can&#39;t recommend an individual item to order from the menu as I have yet to find one that I didn&#39;t thoroughly enjoy. However, I would recommend saving room for one of their delicious malts. While you&#39;re there, make sure you take the time to look at some of the signed pictures they have scattered throughout the place. You&#39;ll see everything from celebrities posing with Dick Portillo to the founder of Jimmy John&#39;s telling Dick that he&#39;s the &#34;only guy who makes a better sandwich than [Jimmy John].&#34; This truly is a great establishment that should serve as a model for restaurants everywhere.

The spicy peppers added a lot of flavor and I would suggest that you don&#39;t order without them. The sandwich is really messy to eat because the sauce makes the buns soggy, i would ask for light on the sauce or dry and on the side next time.

I&#39;ll go out on a limb and say, I hope by now you know that the hot dogs and beefs are good. If not, stop reading and order one, or the other, or both. Whatever. 
But going off my tip, Yelp wants me to elaborate (&#34;great tip now give us more&#34;) I&#39;m going to highlight the underrated: Burger. Call me sacrilegious, I don&#39;t care.
 
The Portillos burger is char broiled and served on a fluffy bun with the usual fixings one would typically expect. It doesn&#39;t sound spectacular, and doesn&#39;t have anything wild n&#39; crazy about it, but that&#39;s the beauty of it. It&#39;s a delicious, no-gimmick, &#39;str8 up&#39; burger. I won&#39;t sit here and tell you that I only eat their burgers, because that would be false, I just thoroughly enjoy a good burger and Portillos is an unexpected place to find one. I don&#39;t know if their crinkle-cut fries seal the deal and really sell the whole meal or what. but I&#39;m a huge fan. 
When I think about the burger itself, I picture it coming from a greasy spoon, mom &amp; pop shop established in 1943, corner hole-in-the-wall burger joint, where the burger is their specialty. Clearly such is not the case, which is why people make the faces they do when I tell them to go to Portillos to feed their burger craving. 

My words of wisdom would be to be brave and don&#39;t order a dog or beef (or salad.....whatever that is) but give the burger a try and you&#39;ll be satisfied.

To make this review relevant to the location: this Portillos is classic; it always feels like a sock hop. Dining in is fine, but the drive through is a well-oiled machine. Hardly a wait (they apologize if they ask you to) and a person is usually standing there to take your order, you pay, and sometimes the food comes even earlier than expected. If only all drive through systems were this smooth..."

We went on a Sunday after going to a super mega-size store in the area.  We wanted food and needed some relaxation.  This place hit all points.  

The staff was nice, efficient, and acted how you&#39;d want from a fast food joint.  

The Food...the food, the food, the food.  This is one of those places that I seek out because of how awesome their food is.  I got the Big Beef dipped, my girlfriend got the regular size beef dipped, and we split an order of fries and had drinks.  This is how a beef should taste.  Yeah, I know Portillo&#39;s is a chain, but is a local one that has awesome food.  

It felt great to relax and enjoy a good meal there.  I&#39;m not going to a Mega Store on Sunday ever again...but if I&#39;m in a place with a Portillo&#39;s, I&#39;d gladly go there.

It&#39;s old-school; I hope it&#39;s never renovated into the big brown hipster-looking version that I&#39;ve sort of come to despise.

Mom and I stopped in today for some deliciousness:  we each got a cheeseburger (hers plain, mine with everything) and cheese fries.  The food was good - nice crispy burger edges, soft buns, fries that aren&#39;t too salty, and liquid cheese of a hue probably not found in nature.  Sadly some of my lettuce was wilty (could have been from burger heat) and my cheese was only partially melted (obviously NOT from burger heat).  There were employees bussing tables (empty tables all looked clean, too) and one kindly took our big plastic tray so we could have more room to eat.  

This good ol&#39; kind of familiarness makes me miss Rolling Meadows."

Portillo&#39;s chocolate cake.  Need I say more?  

I ordered a whole chocolate cake for my son&#39;s second birthday, along with the strawberry shortcake cake for our party.  Not only are these two desserts the best things that have ever graced my lips; the customer service is OUTSTANDING.  They (the catering side) are top-notch, even calling a few days later to ask how everything went.  That&#39;s amazing!

After I had my baby, all I wanted was a piece of their cake.  It&#39;s that good.  Sinful too!  Bless them for making it.  The strawberry shortcake is to die for.  

All the restaurants I have been to of theirs have the most awesome service.  Even if the drive-thru is jam-packed, you get your food pretty fast.  Inside, I am continually impressed with how customer-oriented they really are.  Absolutely love the place!

If you&#39;re like me and have a sweet tooth, definitely order a slice of their chocolate cake, too. Or if you&#39;re feeling a little adventurous, try the chocolate cake shake.

The fries never disappoint and they can rarely mess up an Italian Sausage (with hot peppers). However, my last visit was less than pleasant when I ordered the salad. I assume it was because I came at 2:30pm (after lunch rush) but I have never dined in and received a pre-packaged salad! I was pretty weirded out but did not make a big deal--upon further investigation, it seemed the salad had probably been packaged a while before I ordered. The lettuce was browning and limp... the bacon bits were soft from soaking in the salad... and it was just bad. I have never been so disappointed by Portillos before but no one wants to spend $8 on an old salad. Management: Please stop doing this!!! Give the people what they paid for and stop being lazy.

Calling it fast food almost does it a disservice because this fast food is way, way better than any fast food you&#39;ve gotten anywhere else. 

The Chicago staples, such as hot dogs and Italian beef, are a must try. That said, don&#39;t overlook Portillo&#39;s salads, soup and other menu options that make this an extremely viable option for groups that want more than &#34;just burgers and fries.&#34;

If you&#39;re a first timer, I recommend getting the Italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers &#34;dipped.&#34; The dip plunges your whole sandwich briefly into au jus and takes the flavor over the top. (Grab lots of napkins, the dipped sandwich is messy). 

Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the fries. I don&#39;t know what they do to them, but those standard looking crinkle cut fries are otherworldly. Best fries anywhere at any price point, period. 

Note: this particular location does not have some of the options that you&#39;ll find at many of Portillo&#39;s other restaurants which also include a Barnelli&#39;s (pasta &amp; ribs)."

We&#39;ve been having this argument for years past and I&#39;m sure we will for years to come. What I&#39;ve just realized is that we ALL actually do agree on one thing, though a dog may or may not be the best, we still have plenty of places that make a dam good Chicago dog! Portillo&#39;s is such a place.   

Portillo&#39;s does have a leg up on others with 31+ locations in IL alone. They thrive on their &#34;best service and best food&#34; motto and in my opinion they come very close. Service isn&#39;t always the &#34;best&#34; and the freshness is somewhat border line. I think their 20&#39;s, 30&#39;s, 50&#39;s, and 60&#39;s decor (pending location) is there to distract you a little (which it does, at least for me). And their menu serves up all the reasons Chicagoans are fat. Though, those moments of happiness with each bite does somehow make it worth it, at least during that meal. All of this plus their prices aren&#39;t so bad either, makes for a fine Chicago hot dog joint!

I sat down at the table and took my first bite. Instantly I was transported down memory lane as flashes of well spiced beef, chewy and wet italian bread and melted cheese over delicious sweet peppers bombarded my taste buds. The malt was a sea of creamy, fruity goodness. The cheese fries were salty and cheesey all at the same time. 

Oh I was so satisfied after this meal. My friend, who is not from Chicago, is begging me to take her back there before we leave. I don&#39;t need any convincing. This place is great, no matter what location you frequent."

Portillo&#39;s is certainly the go-to chain for Chicago dogs in the suburbs, but I don&#39;t understand the raves--let alone the &#34;shipped anywhere in the USA!&#34; Italian beef that they apparently offer. (Does that seem like a bad idea to anyone else?)

The Chicago dogs at Portillo&#39;s are entirely competent. Reasonably fresh ingredients, and they appear to come with all the toppings standard (no begging for a pickle or spear peppers). Sesame seed bun, which I prefer. Nice snap. Good.

One of my companions got a chopped salad.  I would have never thought to order a salad at a typical Chicago hot dog stand, but Portillo&#39;s is more of a real restaurant.  The salad appeared to be generously-portioned, fresh, and delicious.

I was less thrilled with the Italian beef, which was garnished primarily with incredibly greasy giardiniera. I asked for it very wet, but it was not drenched with au jus, and was instead swimming in grease. The beef was not too flavorful--very far from where an Italian beef should be.

The bathrooms here were clean, and the 50&#39;s-style dining area was quite large. The service here sharpened to remarkable efficiency. If it were not such an speedy peak lunch experience, I would have given three stars, but I am in fact a fan--I&#39;m a fan of any place that can serve a decent Chicago dog quickly."

This time I ordered the Tilapia Imperial (Tilapia stuffed with other seafood like shrimp, etc). It also comes with two sides of your choice. I ordered the Jasmine Rice and Sweet Potato Mash. The whole dish was delicious. 

I also had a couple martinis. The Ocean Trust Tropic Heat, sweet with a little heat from jalapeño. And the raspberry martini, sweet and seemed alot stronger. Both were good but the Tropic Heat was much better.

If you like Fish definitely go to this restaurant. It&#39;s great food and great service!"

I&#39;ve always been a pretty big fan of Bonefish, especially when it comes to their happy hour. And while I dine at some of the other locations quite often and have decent service and decent food, this particular experience was a rather unique one that I think also deserves some serious recognition. 

Our visit started out as one that I would have initially described as mediocre. In fact, there was some reservation confusion and ordering issues that really would have made this visit that of 2-3 stars. However, the manager&#39;s quick action and attention to the customer experience changed that completely. This location was quite busy for a Tuesday night, but the manager was paying attention to each customers experience and when she noticed ours was not up to par, she made every effort to fix it. She went above and beyond to correct it, and for that I&#39;m incredibly grateful and think that this location is deserving of a 5 star review. 

I&#39;ve worked in customer service for a long time now, and it&#39;s rare to find restaurants and stores that take their customer experience from mediocre to remarkable. I was so thoroughly impressed by how apologetic this team was over issues that so often I would normally let go or just brush off as a decent or not so great experience. But it&#39;s those small issues that eventually add up and dictate our future decisions as consumers in where we eat or where we shop. Because of this great experience I had at Bonefish, I will definitely chose it over the some other mediocre restaurant next time I&#39;m dining out. Thank you to the Algonquin team for turning this experience around and making it one worthy of a 5 star review!"

Had a great martini at the bar before the rest of our party arrived. Excellent service, good fresh food - had the Mahi Mahi Oscar for my entrée with whipped potatoes and sautéed spinach for sides. All good, except for the spinach, which was pretty dry. 

Our table of 6 shared 2 appetizers - mussels, and pot stickers. Both were very good, especially the mussels - could not have been fresher! Four of the 6 of us had birthdays and in addition to the desserts we ordered to share they gave us complimentary wonderful cheesecake. My only discomfort with the evening was being seated in a booth - was way too crowded for a part of six in my opinion.

Other than that - highly recommend and will definitely go back."

Apps and dinner have always been good. Bartenders are excellent, servers for the most part well trained and friendly. Greeting from the hostess needs a lot of help they always make you wait while they study their table chart even with a lot of open tables, they never say &#34;Hello&#34; or make you feel that they are glad you came. Last night we asked for a booth, in a strong voice she said &#34;at least 25 minutes, the attitude was please go away.   We went to the bar ordered a drink and our buzzer went off. This was less than 3 minutes into that 25 minute wait. We stayed at the bar not willing to deal with that hostess and her attitude."

Overall the service was really good though.

The pomegranate martini was amazing and the filet was also really good that I had. The bang bang shrimp for an appetizer was highly recommended. That was excellent! 

My friends scallops and grilled shrimp were also very good and very flavorful.

Now, having recently moved to IL and discovering this location VERY close to where my Girlfriend lives over in the Algonquin Commons I figured it&#39;d be worth visiting. WRONG! 

The food was overpriced, under-cooked, small portioned and repeatedly messed up. I was so upset I even had to send a plate back as it was simply awful. (Lobster Roll.) To further the already ruined experience our server wasn&#39;t very polite, nor was she very knowledgeable about the menu. I could tell that she hated us being there through the glare in here eyes just above her very forced smile. 

$65 we left still hungry, annoyed and very unsatisfied. I will not be back to this location, and as a result of my experiences on that night, I&#39;ll also probably never dine at another Bone-Fish.

The food took a while to arrive, maybe 30-40 minutes, 30-40but it was well worth the wait. The Bang Bang Shrimp is something anyone who attends this restaurant must try. It has a slight spicy kick, but only enough to feel it. The spice is suited for even a sensitive tounge. The sauce the shrimp comes in also has a rich tang and soft crunch that will leave you craving more. I had the salmon, and while it wasn&#39;t very moist, it was still good enough to suit my desire, though a bit tough, but still enjoyable. The restaurant has relatively high prices, so it is well suited to host formal evenings. However, it is relatively steep for people on a budget."

Kiddo got the Kobe burger (very juicy) and truffle Mac n Cheese, I got the Chilean sea bass and hubby got the mahi mahi special. Loved hearing about their POS system, food came out hot and fast. Only draw back was the spaghetti squash side - it was raw. Spaghetti squash needs to be roasted them scrapped the put on paper towels to remove excess moisture. The strings were still crunchy (meaning raw or undercooked). I took a star off for that. And I removed a start for the asparagus side, it was a $3.99 upgrade and I received 4 spears. Quite a mark up.

Great service, food, and wine - just perfect for the bday dinner! AND they gave us a cute little chocolate gifty thingy to help celebrate. 5 stars all the way."

The first Bartender was befuddled by my wine order (bottle) that she had to bring over a second bartender - who pointed out it was a Stags Leap Syrah, (actually a Petite Sarah) and asked if I knew it was a whole bottle.  
Then the first bartender again, asking if I wanted a sample of the wine I had ordered... and then asking my date if she would like one as well. Then they couldn&#39;t find the &#39;bottle order&#39; wine glasses and poured the wine in the little white wine glasses.  Thankfully, they let me pour the rest of the bottle... 
The dinner was hilarious... I asked what type of cut the &#39;Angler steak&#39;, was, and she didn&#39;t know.  I inquired, is it a New York Strip, or a Ribeye? She said she would check and would get back to me.  She informed me it was a midwestern cut.  From Texas.  She was very positive.

First thing I noticed when we were seated is that the paper tablecloth  cover had oil splotch marks on it already.   They change this as part of cleaning/busing the table.  So I&#39;m not sure why ours was pre-dirtied for us. 

To start, I ordered the Corn Chowder with Crab, which was their soup of the day.  This was incredibly good.   Creamy, and velvety with plenty of crab, sweet corn and few small diced potatoes.   Highly recommended. 

For Entrees:  
Chilean sea bass grilled over wood- mango salsa on the side.  This fish is on the pricey side of the menu, at $27.  It&#39;s totally worth it.  The fish was seasoned nicely, and cooked beautifully.  None of the &#34;cook until it flakes easily&#34; nonsense, that indicates over cooked fish.  The outside had a nice sear, and a good layer of seasoning, and it was tender and delicious in the middle. 

Lobster Roll - Lots and lots and lots of lobster.  The lobster is succulent and delicious with a small amount of dressing.  My mayo despising significant other enjoyed this immensely.  The roll is good in its own right--a light fluffy, slightly sweet potato roll. 

Summary:  Food was excellent.  5 Stars.
Being seated at a table with a dirty tablecloth.  1 star."

My friend had a hankering for fish, and she had been to this restaurant and said it was good.  She was correct!!

We made reservations through opentable for 6:30 on a Friday night.  I am really glad we did because the place was packed!!  We didn&#39;t have to wait at all, though.  We were seated in a big comfy booth.  Per the suggestions of other Yelp reviewers, we ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp as an appetizer.  I am SO glad we did.  The crispiness of the breading and the flavor of the sauce made this appetizer quite the delicious little number!  I would order it again and again!!

My friend ordered the Bang Bang Tacos, and those were delicious, and my other friend had the salmon, and she really enjoyed that as well.  I can speak for my tilapia to say that it was cooked to perfection, flaky, and delicious.  I would definitely get it again.  Their fries, however, leave something to be desired, so I would order a different

(Oh wait - I just remembered - fussy children.  That&#39;s right - the boy has now decided seafood is good, and it&#39;s opened up some options for us.)

Based on price, it&#39;s comparable to Red Lobster - however food wise, this is a better choice, for quality, taste and fewer deep fried items.   

It was a week ago - so having a hard time pullng what we all ate out of my brain - I do know son had a fish stuffed with seafood, and loved it.  (I had some too - was delicious.  I had the rainbow trout with lemon butter, and hubby had scallops.  Everything was perfectly cooked and tasty.

Decor is pleasant, wait staff were perfect. We enjoyed our selves.  The restaurant does seem to be a bit more &#34;restaurant&#34; than &#34;bar&#34; (though I think I did spot a loung area on the other side).  It seems to be a bit quieter in atmosphere than some of the other restaurants in Alqonquin Commons - so if you want to be able to chat with the people you are eating with (as opposed to yelling over loud music, cheering sports crowds and/or mildly drunk people) this may be a good option.

Great food, excellent service, reasonable prices for the quality of fare.

We started with the Bang Bang Shrimp because, well, everybody raves about them. They were good, but not sure why they get all the fuss. Spicy shrimp batter fried then coated in a spicy mayo. Interesting and good, but a little overrated.

The bread was amazing and worthy of any Frenchman&#39;s adoration. Crusty crisp exterior, warm soft inside. 

I ordered the Sea Bass with a spinach and crab meat topping called &#34;Kate.&#34; It&#39;s not on the menu, you have to know about it, and it&#39;s worth it. My wife ordered the salmon with mango salsa. Both were very simple presentations, but the fish was so exceedingly fresh that it makes it truly beautiful. 

The key lime pie was likely one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Tart, sweet (but not cloying) and a homemade graham cracker crust.

Their wine list is VERY short. They&#39;re more about cocktails. I ordered a few Maker&#39;s Mark 46&#39;s and a Woodford Reserve. My wife ordered a Newman&#39;s Own Chardonnay (yeah, you read that right, Newman&#39;s Own.)

By the way, someone rated this low because they said it&#39;s always crowded and they always have to wait. Um, for those of you who don&#39;t like to fly standby, you know why Open Table exists. Make a reservation for Bonefish, bonehead. Ha! Get it?"

So.... after reading about Bang Bang shrimp ( and seeing so many people trying to replicate the dish on food sites) I figured it was time to finally retry the restaurant. 

The menu is nice and has variety. It was &#34;bang bang Wednesday&#34; ($5 Bang Bang Shrimp) so we started with that. I dunno.... maybe different locations spice it differently, but it was NOT spicy.... at all. I was SO....disappointed. The breading is good, and the sauce has potential, but frankly, it tasted like mayo mixed with red chili paste or siracha (but not nearly enough to be spicy) and maybe some sweet chili sauce. It was worth $5, but I wouldn&#39;t pay the normal $9.50 price. After seeing so many foodie sites dedicated to trying to figure out the recipe I thought it would have been so much better than it was.

The fish we both ordered was good, but very &#34;over&#34; sauced.... so much so that you lost the flavor of the fish. bummer. Our own fault for ordering the dishes.... I would pick something less complicated next time.

Our server was very nice, but she seemed confused alot. Asked a question about a drink, ended up picking a different one, but got the original one I asked about. 

I have to agree that the portion sizes are a bit small.... skimping on side dishes seems like a cheap way to go, and that was the issue our party had years ago. Using an ice-cream scoop to portion mashed potatoes... potatoes are cheap.... c&#39;mon.

I liked the interior. It felt like you could definitely have a nice romantic dinner, or it would be just as good with a bigger group. Everyone was friendly, and we were treated very well. I think we&#39;ll give it another try.... (maybe we can ask for spicier bang-bang shrimp?) because I&#39;m a huge fish-lover and they do seem to have a nice variety."

I don&#39;t care for fish but I do enjoy shrimp/crab and of course a good steak which I have always had at Bonefish.

That said, my experience at this location as well as another in the Chicago &#39;burbs have always been the same.  A long wait followed by a cramped and loud dining room.

A few weeks back my wife and I made a reservation at this location.  I was surprised we could get a prime-time reservation only a few hours ahead of time, but hey, go with it.  Well, we arrived about 5 minutes before our reservation time and then waited for 40 more before we were finally seated IN THE BAR.

After that, the service was ok, not great.  We waited about ten minutes to make our drink order and also waited a while to get our check after dinner.  The food was good as always but the whole night left a bad taste.

As another reviewer mentioned, these restaurants are very small.  There is virtually no room to wait for a table, and that includes the bar.  I mean, if you are waiting for a table, that means the place is full so...

If you don&#39;t mind a long wait for a table, and then a 90-minute meal from drink order to check, then by all means rush on down.  At least the food is good."

Wife ordered macadamia crusted snapper, as did mother-in-law. When they cut into it, Mom&#39;s fish was light  and flaky and wife&#39;s was tough and underdone. They took it back and it came out in less than two minutes, and was tougher than chewed pork. I wonder whether they slapped it in the microwave? When I was a cook, the kitchen manager looked at all food that was sent back before fixing it. If I was manager tonight, I would have not served this fish!  The manager did a great job of service recovery, however, and she didn&#39;t pay for the meal. My guess is that this kind of thing happens even at nice establishments.  For us, we really liked eating here before.  Oh well."

Bacon Wrapped Scallops...The Bacon was hard was as a rock. I had to remover it in order to eat the scallop.  Even if it wasn&#39;t over done it was just OK
Bang Bang Shrimp... ( Recommended)   Not sure what the fuss is about!  Looked like a pile of muck on a bed of lettuce.  Breaded shrimp with a cream sauce pored over it. Greasy. Taste was OK.  Not what I expected at all. Not a lot of bang either.
Baja Fish Tacos.... Very Good!  Could taste the grilled flavor of the fish.... Comes with a small side salad of fresh greens. Would order them again.
Served warm bread ...very nice... with olive oil and pesto? for dipping. Very good.
Beer selection is average.  
Freezing air conditioning blowing  through the restaurant  killed wanting to stay any longer. 
Service was good while ordering but slacked off as the place got busy...... Lots of traffic.
May be awhile but would go back for the fish tacos."

Upon walking in, my first reaction was suprise at the size of the restaurant.  I was expecting a monstrosity but instead, this restaurant is a touch on the small side.  Very clean, fresh and well appointed.

Cindy, our server, did an excellent job this evening.  Service was timely but not overbearing; just how I like it. Their house sangria at $5 was well worth every penny.  

I had heard the Bang Bang shrimp was to die for, so I ordered that as an appetizer.  It turned out to be my main course too as it was very hearty.  By the time I was done, I was absolutely stuffed.  

I did manage to leave room for that Creme Brulee I spotted on the menu earlier and I was not disappointed.  This dessert had to be the deepest Creme Brulee I ever had.  

The shocking part of the whole evening was at the end of our meal.  I was thanking Cindy for an excellent dining experience when she dropped a bomb shell on us -- Tonight was her first night on the job!  Imagine my suprise.  The meal was perfect and her service was Five Star all the way and here she is on her first night as a server.  Way to go Cindy!

We will be going back to Bonefish Grill quite often."

It has been a while since I&#39;ve been to a Bonefish and I&#39;m impressed this location is operating on all cylinders.  First the food:  Ceviche...a tad too salty but fresh lime flavor.  Bang-bang shrimp...always good yet this version tasted like there was more soy added with some of the heat taken away.  Fish-n-chips...not a fan of talapia but loved the batter and the tarter was nice and fish was nice and flaky *so* I guess I like BF&#39;s talapia.  Crab cakes...totally agree with the server on how the presentation is poor but the flaky crab was fresh.  Drinks...big a** blue cheese olives served three per martini I&#39;m *so* fan of that! Finished off with the PBJ bread pudding.  Bread pudding was dry, ice cream was awesome (imagine the filling of a Reese&#39;s Cup) and the raspberry sauce was average.  I recommend asking for extra raspberry and ensuring you get a bite of all three ingredients when digging in, otherwise it will be disappointing experience.   Bottom line the entire staff seemed to have their act together and this location was packed the night we went.  Great overall experience and I can see why the neighboring joints are *not* on a 40 minute wait on a rainy Wednesday!"

We sat on aisle next to the booths and felt like we were on top of the table next to us.

Both times I ordered the Salmon and it came back dry. They love to flavor everything up a bit too much, so you might want to request easy on the spices.

The server was a bit pushy as they wanted to keep the people moving in and out even though there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. I guess when you have eaten seafood on the east coast you realize this place doesn&#39;t even come close. Come on, this is Algonquin not Chicago. The prices should reflect the suburbs and they are a bit steep in my opinion. I don&#39;t see a reason to return to this place."

The most recent visit was on Sunday, 2/17. We (a family of five with 2 young kids and a teenager) were seated in a booth right in front of the revolving door. We had to shiver during the whole time we stayed there. To add insult to injury, we noticed that they increased their kids&#39; meal prices. My 4 y.o. daughter ordered a plate of fish strips, which cost $7.9 and my younger son had popcorn shrimp, which was $6.3. Well the fish was actually good, nice crisp breading, but it came with 3 pieces of broccoli, no tar tar sauce, ketchup, or cocktail sauce. My son got his shrimp with SIX sticks of french fries.. SIX!! We thought it was a joke. My husband had the &#34;customer favorite&#34; longfin tilapia stuffed with crab etc. It was around $18 and it was really slim pickings for a 180 pound guy. Our total bill was over $60...Definitely felt like we were cheated. The waitress was nice but she never asked to refill our water glasses or offered to bring another warm bread and olive oil/herbs appetizer. It seemed like they were short on staff, the place was extremely busy and crowded. Overall we definitely felt that: 1. the prices have increased; 2.the quantity of portions have decreased significantly; 3.they were short on staff. We recently stayed in Naples, FL, and dined at the local Bonefish grill, and were pleasantly surprised with the quality/quantity of food there. However, it seems that is not the case at our home town restaurant anymore, sadly. Just based on this last visit, I have to say that we&#39;re seriously considering looking for another family favorite fish restaurant."

Egg rolls are yummy,  love the cabbage,  meat,  and spices. 

Cuttlefish was fried,  greasy(hell yea), and delicious with a sprinkle of diced jalapeño and carrots.   We ate it with the giant box of white rice that came with our order.

The people that work there are very nice and speak Cantonese. Apparently they also serve things like intestine and wonton noodle soup, I&#39;ll work my way to those eventually.

They have some of the best seafood in the area. I highly recommend any seafood dish. I have been avoiding their beef due to some overtenderization issues. Their chicken is really juicy.

Authentic Food
Red Curry Chicken - They added Thai food to their menu recently. The Thai curry is pretty good, I would say not as good as Dan Thai but pretty good.  The Chicken is much juicier than thai chicken which is almost jerk texture.  This kinda made things weird for me. But the curry itself was done well.  I will try some of their other ones in the future since you get SO MUCH MORE food for the same price as Dan Thai.

Salt and Pepper Shrimp - Shell on - the best of this has an easy time of eating the shell, with very minimal notice of the shell.  Here you notice the shell but can also eat the shell.  The shrimp are cooked perfectly.  This is the first place that has carrots in their SP Shrimp, different, not sure I like that part.

Walnut Shrimp - wonderfully cooked shrimp, a bit over battered, with perfectly cooked broccoli and walnuts.  The sauce is great, though for take out, the steam in the container washed some of it off and made liquid on the bottom, but probably not an issue if you eat there or if you open the container sooner rather than later.

White Rice - perfectly cooked fluffly white rice.

Americanized Food
Sweet and Sour Shrimp - the shrimp are big and perfectly cooked, tender, and succulent.  The sauce is authentic, not that neon orange stuff, it is the darker stuff and has some pineapples and green peppers in them.  It&#39;s great!

Fried Rice - they have gotten their fried rice act together. There is so much Wok Hei (the smokiness that makes fried rice good) and it is not hard rice. Best Fried rice in the area for sure.

Egg Rolls - this has improved since the last time few times I had them, they come free with lunch specials so I try them regularly.  It&#39;s not the best but an acceptable egg roll now.

Crab Rangoon - these are wonderfully delicious, a very sweet mixture compared to most rangoons. It&#39;s not traditional but it&#39;s good, more desserty, and the fry is perfectly crispy and crunchy."

I&#39;ve started ordering a week since they opened...but no more with their new and improved 25% increase...!?!? You&#39;ve gotta to be pretty desperate to hike prices more than the consumer price index rise in the United States during the last 10 years!

During the last two recent orders, the quality has visibly declined proportionately.  The key ingredients (e.g. Shrimp) have gotten less and the quality of cooking has also gone downhill. Either they changed kitchen staff but it&#39;s not the same Family anymore. Family House has now been infested with the greed roach!

This is a telltale sign of a business on a downward spiral... Pay more for mediocrity.  Thanks but there many more options around here that offers better alternatives.  I give this place another few months before its goes off life support."

The soup was served hot and the favors where delicious. The egg roll was loaded with chicken, beef and shrimp. It is served with their own version of duck sauce. Excellent. The sweet and sour pork was battered but served with a traditional red sauce with peppers and pineapples in it. I opted for the combo fried rice and it was brimming with chicken, pork and beef. Overall the food was top shelf and the only bad item was the fortune cookie served at the end was stale. Can&#39;t blame Family House for that."

My husband loved it and couldn&#39;t stop raving.  I was very impressed by how clean the dining area was (except the condiment baskets were sticky) and how friendly the staff was.  We were the only people eating in, but it seemed like they had a lot of to go and delivery orders.  Nice lunch special that included egg roll, soup, and rice ($6-8).  The options were pretty typical, but what really stood out from our lunch was the crab rangoon.  They were huge and full of filling.  I could only eat two.  I&#39;m sure we will be back- especially with the convenient location to the library we frequent."

Started to order delivery and they pack a load in those containers. I mean that chow mein lunch special . . .  I couldn&#39;t believe how much they gave us, but I most certainly am not complaining. They gave us crab rangoon for free and truly looks and tastes better from the first time I ordered during the summer. 

Truth be told, this is my second time ordering delivery from them this week. That&#39;s just how good it has been. I would say they are pushing towards above average. Keep on pushing! Not missing chinatown as much anymore. 

This place will be my to go take out place! You guys will be hearing from me again. Good job."

The location is very close to us. I enjoyed the eggplant and chicken with salty fish #336 very much. Their lo mein noodles with beef and chicken was also a hit. The orange chicken was good but maybe a bit too sweet. The salt and pepper pork was flavorful but the meat was a bit too fatty. They forgot to give us enough white rice (we only got one takeout carton). I will definitely consider this place again next time for take out or if we have another party.

The place was clean and there was plenty of seating, including booths.  They seated us right away and were very friendly. After we were seated and got our menus, they offered us free egg drop soup, which was delicious. My family and I are vegetarians, so we were happy to see that there were plenty of vegetable and tofu items on the menu.
We ordered vegetable egg rolls, vegetable egg foo young ,orange tofu, and vegetable chop suey. The vegetables were very fresh, not overcooked. The broccoli was nice and crispy and the orange sauce on the tofu was terrific. The dishes weren&#39;t oily or greasy, they were light-tasting and had a nice flavor.
The waitresses were attentive and checked on us frequently to refill our hot tea and ask if we needed anything.  We enjoyed our dining experience there, and will definitely be back to try other dishes."

It wasn&#39;t savory and didn&#39;t have any spice to it. It tasted OK, but wasn&#39;t what I expected. Even though the portion was huge, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be eating the leftovers.

Good mashed potatoes, awesome corn bread, stuffing was out of this world (tasted just like mom&#39;s). The Sunday special was $17.95, and so worth it - I couldn&#39;t even finish half the plate! We ordered the pistachio gelato for dessert and it was a good choice. Nice and light and not too sweet, and that nutella crust was really tasty.

Decor - So beautiful. The lights, the Christmas decorations, the music...it was all perfect. It felt like a very romantic and cozy setting.

Service - That&#39;s where the one star got knocked off. We waited for awhile in the lobby because there wasn&#39;t a receptionist there to attend to the crown of people building up. Our waitress got distracted in the middle of our order by a customer behind us, so we were interrupted for a little bit during that process. I think I was expecting just a touch more of better quality service to match with the Millrose concept.

They are closing for renovations after dinner service on Christmas Eve. I&#39;m glad I got to make it there before then, and I&#39;m looking forward to visiting the new space!"

Decor:
A very clean and neat place first of all when you walk right in.  Has a woodsy look to it which gives it that pure country Americana feel to it.  It is a wonderful looking place that has a very cozy feel to it.

Service:
The service was impeccable and impressive. There is nothing that I could complain about when it came to the service.  The wait staff was kind, polite and down to Earth. When you needed something they brought jt out right away. Absolutely excellent service. 

Food:
The food was fantastic.  I had the oven roasted chicken with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I could tell the chicken was well seasoned amd had been cooking for a good while before being served.  I always like places that care about quality over profits.  Also the portions are extremely generous since they give you half a whole chicken.  There had to be rosemary, pepper, salt and butter in the chicken.  Can&#39;t go wrong with this dish here!

Price:
I can&#39;t tell what the price was since I went here for a wedding party.  However, you can always call in and ask for the prices.  

Overall experience:
A very good place with good food and excellent service.  I had a wonderful time!"

The atmosphere is the selling point here because the enormous barns that make up the restaurant are beautiful. 

On a side note: The blonde hostess (probably in her 50&#39;s) is a real sour-puss. I was taking a look around the beautiful restaurant and sour-puss kept glaring at me like a mother goose and making me uncomfortable. Stay away from that sour-puss."

I went here on a Friday night recently with a group of friends: 5 gals who get together every month in the suburbs. It was picked by one woman because, as many have noted in other reviews, it used to be great. It also had live music, a certain Tony Ocean. I read the bad reviews but figured, it will probably be good enough, so let&#39;s just go.

Issue #1: the service. In addition to yakking our ears off about how she can&#39;t keep beer lists straight because she works 3 jobs, our server literally disappeared between drink and food ordering. I&#39;m talking 15-20 minutes. When she finally returned, we had gotten one order in when the food was being &#34;dropped&#34; (as she kept repeating) at a nearby table of hers and she needed to go over and assist with that before taking the rest of our orders. She also reeked of cigarettes, and while I understand many people take smoke breaks in food service, clearly others have figured out how to not come back smelling like it. Lastly, when we asked about our food (which was mostly ordered off the pub menu and were not complex dishes) she said, &#34;Yep, it&#39;s cooking. It&#39;s gotta be cooked before it comes out.&#34; Perhaps not their best hiring decision.

Issue #2: the music. It was extremely loud, and very tacky. It gave the whole place a vibe that I think, unfortunately, it&#39;s going for: a restaurant and bar for empty-nested suburbanites looking to &#34;let loose&#34; on a Friday night. Everyone there over 55 looked like they were having a great time dancing and singing along to the oldies but goodies that Tony Ocean kept churning out. Literally, there was a guy that looked like Rod Stewart, who at first was just dancing with all the ladies and then, at the end, turned out to be another singer in the &#34;band.&#34; Wow. We usually close down a restaurant when we get together, sitting around talking, but we left when we couldn&#39;t handle the volume anymore.

Issue #3: the food. What&#39;s one thing that&#39;s pretty hard to screw up? A BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Well guess what, this, too, was sub-par. My sweet potato waffle fries (the best part!!) came in a quantity of five, which was deeply disappointing. I was only happy to note that the sandwich wasn&#39;t too expensive, I had waffle fries as an option to sub in, and they had bottled Angry Orchard cider. Thank god for small favors.

All in all, I highly discourage anyone who is not from the NW suburbs and over 60 to go here. If you do go, order off the less-expensive pub menu, and get ready to never see your server."

An incentive that brought us back was their promotion for a full slab of ribs for $10 and I was glad to take advantage while the deal was valid. I usually don&#39;t order ribs out, which is a shame because I love them, but they require a commitment and a dozen or so moist towelettes, but here I didn&#39;t care.

Go rib or go home.

Millrose has a real, classic, country feel; this is made so with their wood grains and antler chandeliers which adds nicely to their charm. We didn&#39;t have reservations and the wait was substantial, so we decided to sit in the bar area upstairs. It was fairly dark so it was a little challenging as far as a dining experience, but if we were just there for drinks and apps it would have been great. 

After ordering, our drink orders came, however the beers we received were incorrect. Our server was apologetic and very quick to correct the error so there was really no harm done. I did note that the bartender was spending some time chatting up the (seeming) regulars, but didn&#39;t get the beers right; I would have docked a star for that typically, but our server handled the situation seamlessly. 

Ultimately, ribs were good; I ate them all and my fries. I wouldn&#39;t get them again probably, but just so I can try something else on the menu. I&#39;d probably have to wait for another promotion or coupon/groupon  to come around, but I&#39;ll certainly keep my eyes peeled for it. I&#39;d also like to check out the country store but I&#39;ll have to leave that for another time...but don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll review that too. 
Enjoy."

Before homecoming in high school (and I don&#39;t remember it because it was that long ago)
During a pub crawl (and I don&#39;t remember it because there were three other stops before that one...so....whoops)

So when the in-laws wanted to celebrate two family birthdays here the other day at their Sunday brunch, I was curious to see how it would be.  Since my last two times were...unmemorable.

There were ten of us (including two kids) and each adult is $20.  The kids are $12, I think.  In any case, it was definitely not worth it.

They have a good concept set up (non alcoholic drinks are included, and your waitress will get those for you) and you tell your waitress what kind of omelet you want or if you want sunny side up eggs.  Five people ordered omelets, and they took FOREVER to come out.  At least 30 minutes.  And they weren&#39;t even very good, that&#39;s the worst part.

And my poor husband was waiting to eat his other food because he wanted room for the omelet, so he was really sad the whole time.  Sad and hungry.  Not cool at a buffet.

The rest of the food was lackluster.  The ham was dry, most of the food was cold, and it was just a dreary experience all around.  Definitely not worth the hefty $20 price tag.

Our waitress was really nice and attentive, so I will give her that.  She definitely did the best she could, but it just didn&#39;t really impress all that much.  I definitely wouldn&#39;t go back for brunch.  They seem to cater to an older crowd, but it was even sparse at 11:30 in the morning."

Have gone there alot in the past but the  atmosphere has changed.  Used to be cozy now it has bright spot lights all overhead.  Only 1 bartender that was actually working the other one was standing there texting.  We ordered second drinks but never got them.  Felt bad for the one bartender that was working he had to cover the entire bar plus all the tables. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the band was good.

Our server seemed to be new because when asked what kind of sauce came on the appetizer he said he didn&#39;t know. When asked what else came with the fish he said he didn&#39;t know. 
The highlight of the evening was how quickly dirty dishes were bussed from the table. We were at a table barely big enough for the two of us so it was nice to have everything cleared so quickly to have enough room.

Started out with a delightful relish tray cheese and rolls,  delicious!  

Nice wine selection with reasonable prices.  Great beer selection and $5.00 octoberfest prices.  

Tough call for dinner but went with the octoberfest special. I went for the prime rib but decided to try the special, Pork schnitzel with sour cream mashed potatoes and sliced beets. Great flavor over all.  I would of liked the pork to be a bit more tender but still good.  German sausage soup was awesome.  My husband had 1/2 rib s and chicken and the ribs fell of the bone. He is pretty picky and thought it was great.

5 stars for ambience. Outside had a fireplace and the courtyard was beautifully decorated for fall. The whole restaurant is rustic and decorated for fall.

Service was great.  We will be back."

We had our wedding reception (second marriage for us both) at Millrose in 2008, and everything was exceptional, from the food and drinks at the bar, to the service. And we chose it for its warm yet casual atmosphere, and the fact that dinners there had always been wonderful.

Fast forward to 2012. I was looking for a place to host meetings for an organization I belong to. It was a big request, because we need volunteer vendors to hold our events - we don&#39;t have the funds to pay for it ourselves. (We aren&#39;t non-for-profit, but pretty darn close.) I thought, having spent $1000&#39;s there in the past, they might be able to accommodate us in someway. We are willing to run our meetings during off-hours to stay out of the way of staff, and we also are willing to do in on-hours, and have ale cart services for members who DO want to eat. And of course, it brings potential customers through the doors every month, who might stick around for lunch.

The reception I got was extremely cold. Evidently another women&#39;s group that bears no resemblance to ours had been a bad deal for them, so the woman in charge (who clearly sounded like I was wasting her time) would have none of it. Really wouldn&#39;t even hear me out.

That was NOTHING like their customer service in the past. And as I read more recent reviews. sounds like the food is taking a nose-dive as well. Sad."

Met a friend for lunch today and we were one of the few parties in the place at 1130am on a Sunday (and no offense, the only party under 60), and it stayed that way until we left at 1:00pm.  After our experience I am guessing I know why:

Service - our server seemed new, yet it appeared he was one of the only servers in the place.  He was handling the patio and inside tables adjacent to the patio. He did not know the menu when asked very basic preparation questions. We had to flag him down to order drinks, replace a drink that was wrong, order our meal, get refreshes and ask where our food was 40 minutes later. (we ordered very simple breakfast plates - nothing crazy fancy here).

Our server said that the &#34;kitchen has been messing up all day, they are probably still sleeping back there&#34; which made me want to leave immediately.  He said the food would be out &#39;I think probably in about 5 minutes for sure&#34; ??

Finally received breakfast one hour after ordering it and it was correct. It was eggs, bacon, toast for me and waffle w syrup for my friend.  Nothing worth waiting an hour for.  

4.  After consuming the meal, the server came back to tell us that he was leaving soon, that the restaurant closes from noon to 2pm on Sundays (??) to prep for dinner.  I guess this is a Supper Club now but they are open at 9 - noon on Sundays...maybe this is why people aren&#39;t here, they don&#39;t get the hours and the concept.  He said we could stay as long as we wanted, which we did, but we won&#39;t be able to get anything until the restaurant reopened at 2:00. 

My suggestion to this restaurant - 1.  update the decor - people want to eat good food in a pleasant atmosphere that does not smell musty 2.  upgrade the service and cook staffs - teach your servers to be mindful of the customer, help them understand the menu, remind them they are &#34;servers&#34;.  and 3. market yourself the way this restaurant used to so that you can bounce back, attract new and existing customers - otherwise it does not appear you&#39;ll be in business much longer and that would be very sad."

Appetizer: bacon and jalapeño shrimp - 3 large shrimp that were cooked perfectly and wrapped in bacon that was just the right amount of crispy, all glazed in a teriyaki glaze and served over chili cilantro sauce.

Entree: I had the pot roast - it was very tender and pulled apart so easily. It was served with vegetables, garlic mashed potatoes and gravy that helped offset the slight dryness to the meat.

Dessert:  kahlua chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream on top. They offer small portions of each of their dessert options which is awesome, the small portion was the perfect size for me!"

We went to Millrose at the invitation of friends.  I had the salmon.  The piece of salmon was small, smaller than the 6 oz portions you buy at the supermarket.  It was lukewarm and sat on a mound of even colder mashed potatoes. Both items were flavorful, but they were too cold to enjoy.  Because I was with friends, I did not want to make a fuss, so I took most of it home.  Another friend at the table had the ribs which he also mentioned were cold.  I am guessing they have lots of pre-prepared food which they reheat, but not very well, prior to serving.  Never again will we eat here."

I&#39;ve lived in the area majority of my life and I&#39;ve never been to Millrose before this past weekend.  My experience was by far the worst experience I&#39;ve ever had.  We reserved a section upstairs to celebrate my aunt turning 50, to be notified when the party arrived that they were going to sit us in the back of the restaurant instead.  The host did not escort our party to the table, he simply told us our table was in the back of the restaurant and pointed.  The funny thing is everyone else that walked into that establishment was escorted to their table.

Our server was notified of our displeasure and told &#34;management&#34; (I use that term very loosely) and instead of coming to speak with us the &#34;manager&#34; sent out three free appetizers.  In an effort to make my aunt&#39;s big day joyful we disregarded the rude service we&#39;ve received and ordered dinner.  We ordered the prime rib, roasted chicken and a pasta dish with red sauce.  The prime rib was awful.  We&#39;ve been to Gibson&#39;s and other steakhouses before and have had prime rib before, but this meat that was served was just absolutely awful.  We asked that the server please send &#34;management&#34; to our table and replace the Prime Rib meals with roasted chicken.

One of the waitresses found it appropriate to yell across the restaurant that there was no more chicken and that she was going to have the chef cook the steak longer.  The temperature of the meat wasn&#39;t the problem, it was the taste or lack there of.  After not being accommodated and growing more and more angry we asked again for the &#34;manager&#34; and to remove the prime rib meals from our bill and to bring out the birthday cake that we brought to the establishment for my aunt.  We were then told that it would cost $1 per slice to cut our cake.  Needless to say we opted to use a knife at the table and cut our own cake, but we couldn&#39;t do that because the &#34;manager&#34; came and put the icing on the cake of ruining our joyous moment.  She came to the table very rude and defensive of our displeasure with her establishment and the food.  She proceeded to act very inappropriately in front of her two assistant managers and spoke in a very condescendingly to the party.  

Instead of coming to the table with apologies and solutions.  She came, I don&#39;t know about an hour after she heard our first complaint and continued to say this was all a mishap because we were all confused about what Prime Rib was.  My aunt and I proceeded to tell her she was being rude and also let her know why we were displeased with the service we had received.  We gave her examples and again her remarks were inappropriate excuses.  We didn&#39;t yell, never rose our voice, didn&#39;t speak an ounce of Ebonics or vulgar language.  That didn&#39;t stop the &#34;manager&#34; from getting riled up, she asked us to hurry and finish up so we could get out, told us to contact her boss and it didn&#39;t matter if we did because she was the VP.  She and assistants then left the table to call the Barrington police on us.

I rarely use the race card, but I can say as of that night I know what it looks like to be racially discriminated against.  I would have received a better meal and service at Ihop across the street.  When we left this HORRIBLE place we had dinner and laughed at the comedians on stage at the Schaumburg Improv.  This lady and her staff may have ruined our dinner, but they did not ruin our night nor my aunt&#39;s milestone moment."

I admit its been a year and a half since my last visit which typically was about once a year. But where are the high backed chairs? Where are the king crab legs that were cut open for you so all you had to do was enjoy those huge pieces of sweet seafood? And oh my god where is the Beer!? 

Not only do they not have their own labeled beer anymore, what they do have is not up to the level of a place that once cared so much about beer they either brewed or commissioned their own beers!  Dark Star where have you gone, our nation turns its thirsty eyes to you!

It&#39;s as if the old generation retired and the next generation got rid off low margin options in order to squeeze every penny of profit out of that joint.

He&#39;s where I&#39;d put my review of the actual food (vs. just writing about what the restaurant used to be), but honestly it wasn&#39;t worth reviewing.  I&#39;m not even going to mention how my Prime Rib order wasn&#39;t taken because they ran out. This happens, but the chef didn&#39;t get that news to our waitress until 20 minutes after we ordered.  I don&#39;t get it. You have x pounds of prime rib.  You have two size orders.  You have computers the waitresses enter the orders into. Order goes in, subtracts the order from the remaining inventory, if greater than what&#39;s left... Reject.  Annoying.

If I&#39;m around and hungry, I&#39;d consider, but I am no longer going out of my way to eat here again.  In fact, I may just try the place across the street if in the area next time, they seem to get good reviews.

We started with a shrimp cocktail, the sauce was good the shrimp fit their description...shrimp.  Meh.

The free bread was good, the drinks were served in larger glasses but were only half filled....again Meh.

We both ordered ribs the price was not bad but then the server mentioned that they used to be more expensive...probably meant they used to be a lot better as well.   The taste left behind a very nasty after taste and the sauce at first wasn&#39;t bad but as it cooled off it just became this over sweet paste.

I asked the server about the hours of the market and I ended up waiting a half an hour for that answer and wouldn&#39;t have gotten one if I didn&#39;t say something to remind her.

Overall we loved the decor but will not be going back for the dinner again..."

I always liked the beer samplers and basic bar burger food, but thought it was a little pricey for a big piece of meat that I probably don&#39;t want and if it was really a special occasion I probably wouldn&#39;t go THERE, but not bad for the burbs, AND well located off the tollway and Barrington Road. So when we had some company in town, who I know often goes for the big piece of meat, I thought of Millrose. Of course we show up so late on a Thursday night at 8:59 (found out LATER the kitchen closes at 9). You could tell the pretty hostess wasn&#39;t thrilled but SHE was leaving as soon as she seated us, and then everything was very good. Alfredo was our happy to see us server and did a great job with everything, including a couple good BYOB bottles, $15 corkage, no problem, and we were LATE.

We had everything from fajitas to ribs, greek chicken &amp; a panko pork schnitzel, and it was all very good. Quietly perfectly served, decent fries and salad/sides.

So we are moving them up from the &#34;beautiful day OUTDOOR burger&#34; forgotten list to the &#34;late snowy lunch or dinner by the fireplace&#34;. It IS a gorgeous place, and just ignore the fact that you ARE now turning into your parents eating here instead of at the hipster Lucky Monk (very good).

While the menu was diverse, it was extremely over-priced. Trying to compete near Morton&#39;s or Ruth&#39;s Chris prices, I expect more. The steak was tough and not quality. I believe the Mahi-Mahi was the cause of my violent &#34;rejection&#34; last night; however, I am not a clinician. 

As noted earlier, drinks were over-priced as well.

This is definitely a place that appeals to older folks: when we walked in the door, everyone in the lobby was at least 80 years old -- it was like you had to be on Medicare to get on the waiting list for a table. I felt positively like an infant next to this crowd.

Once we got past God&#39;s Waiting Room, we were seated in a large, dark dining room. This place is very large overall, lots of seating but not a lot of light. 
Our waitress was middle-aged, brisk and peppy, and had clearly worked there for a while. She gave us time with the lunch menu, which consisted largely of salads, sandwiches and burgers. 

I chose the Mini Trio, three sliders composed of different fillings: seared beef and onions; pulled BBQ pork; and crab cake with remoulade. The crab was good; the sauce on the pork was too sweet, and the beef had a good taste but was tough (I had a hard time ripping it apart with my teeth; not very successful as a burger). The fruit cup that came with it was good (particularly the pineapple), and the cream of mushroom soup I ordered (the Soup du Jour) was excellent. 

My grandmother&#39;s friend (who&#39;d picked the restaurant) had said the place was known for pork, but I didn&#39;t really see it reflected too much in the menu, until we went to the &#34;country store&#34;. This was more than just a Cracker-Barrel-type shop; they had meat-to-go in here (ribs! steaks! bacon! more!), plus gourmet goods of all kinds, an impressive selection of wine, and then various gifty items (my mom bought a pretty necklace -- not exactly what you&#39;d expect in a place that also sells bulk bacon). 

People clearly know this shop well -- again, this was the week of Christmas, and they were stuffed into the shop, going for the meat in particular. We filed past the cooler with the pork in it and it was full of  packs of thick-cut bacon; when we walked back 10 minutes later a guy was stuffing every package (at least 6 or 7) into his basket! I bought some of the thin-sliced (not being a fan of thick-cut bacon -- I guess I&#39;d have been out of luck anyway, though!) and made some the next day; it had a great, maple-y scent and a woodsy flavor. They definitely know what they&#39;re doing with the pork! 

Though I might not rush back to the restaurant, I&#39;d certainly swing into the store the next time I&#39;m in the Schaumburg area. Millrose meat can&#39;t be beat!"

Absolutely none of the food stood out.  It&#39;s a very comfortable, well run restaurant.

Smoked salmon, but no crackers or thin sliced bread, just pathetic looking bagels.  Desserts are there for quantity, not quality.

I remember back in the day when going out for a steak meant heading out for a thinly sliced cut of mediocre meat doused with tenderizer.  This is the emotion that the Millrose evokes.  
We went for a prime rib dinner at 7:30 on Saturday night. Lo and behold, they were sold out of their weekend specialty at this &#34;late&#34; hour of the evening.  They up-sold us to the rib-eye which is the same cut of beef but at at twice the price.  The steaks are Choice grades - not the better graded Prime cuts that most steak houses in the city offer.

Nothing else. The ribs had very little meat and tasted like they had slathered them in ketchup, not bbq sauce. There was no crispy, carmelized top on the ribs like what I am used to. They seemed like they were just boiled and then some ketchup thrown on them and stuck in an oven. Not very tasty. I barely at 1/4 of the slab. My daughter had the chicken franciese which was good, but waaaaaay overpriced. It was $20 for this dish and the portion was small. We also ordered the fried calamari which was breaded with cornmeal. Although the calamari was very tender, it had no crisp whatsoever and was served in a small soup bowl and then sat in the grease so it made it even soggier. These were priced at 9.95 again, for a tiny portion that weren&#39;t even worth 1/2 that. My husband opted for the burger. It was good. We were told that their &#34;steak burger&#34; consists of the scraps from all of their meats which are thrown together and then ground down for their burger. Ewww! They should call it a &#34;scrap burger&#34; not a steak burger. But my hubby did enjoy it. I had a bite and found it very fatty and grizzly (sp?). The only reason for two stars is for the ambiance and warm homey feel you get here. Love the fireplaces, all the wood and the servers are pretty good. I might go back if they lower their prices or run some other specials."

This is the usual ribs, chicken, steak, pot roast and meatloaf in grandma&#39;s dining room kind of place.  I doubt there are many choices for vegetarians here.

They never hurry you out and the hosts are always friendly.  They run entertainment specials from time to time, like dinner and a show.  This is a family place good for grandma, grandpa and the kiddos.  

I like the prime rib ladies cut.  Served with a soup or salad, potato and veggie of the day.  Hubby likes the chicken cordon blue with marsala sauce and also served with soup or salad.

They sell gift certificates on restaurant.com."

Instead we were provided a ridiculous argument which left us with no choice other than to walk out before ordering. We then went to a well-run Prime Steak restaurant 7 miles east and spent the money we had planned to spend at Millrose on a fine drama free meal with great service. If the producers of one of those Restaurant Disaster makeover television shows happen to read this, you may want to reach out to the owners of Millrose and see if they will let you help.

On the first of these two visits, I thought the restaurant was having an &#34;off night,&#34; which happens with the best of restaurants.

On the most recent visit, however, we were a bit surprised to see how few cars there were in the parking lot and how few patrons were in the restaurant.   After our dinner arrived, I began to understand a bit better.

During the entire dinner, we swatted gnats, fruit flies, and a large house fly.   This is inexcusable, particularly because there are plenty of safe and effective ways pest control companies can fix this problem.

The food was okay (not great), the drinks were watery-tasting, but the absolute worst part of the experience was the many different types of flies.   I&#39;m sure there&#39;s an excuse for this, but the best excuses in the world don&#39;t prevent unsanitary conditions ... or bring once-loyal customers back to a restaurant, which judging from the many lackluster reviews, has had better days in years past."

I feel like I should only review this place if I had a full meal here, but oh well, still gonna rate my drink experience here.

First of all, drinks are WAY expensive here.  I was not expecting to dish out $9 for a martini here--I know that can be a typical price for a martini in the burbs, but this isn&#39;t a fancy place to me.  I feel like $9 for a martini should be spent at a steakhouse where they are going to use top shelf liquor, not Smirnoff.  My boyfriend&#39;s beers were about $5, so not terrible, but they weren&#39;t amazing to him.

Anyway, we were not directly at the bar, we were seated at the little tables and our waitress was just terrible.  First of all, the bar is like an arms length away and it still takes her about 15-20 mins to get our drinks.  Also, since we said we were just drinking, she felt that she didn&#39;t need to come up to us at all and ask how things were, if we needed water, etc.  And when we wanted our check, it took FOREVER.  Let me put this into perspective here--my boyfriend and I got two drinks each and we were there for 2 1/2 hours.  Service was slow and not worth the money."

Yeah, not anymore.

Wednesday night, 7:30, we were one of maybe three parties in the place. And we *still* had slow service. Greeted by a waitress we never saw again. Had to walk from our table in the bar to the actual bar to get a beer.

Accidentally grabbed a dinner menu instead of a bar menu and about fell off my chair. There wasn&#39;t an item on the whole menu for less than $25. Prices ranged upwards toward $40. A *baked potato side dish* was $5.50. Bad math, guys: 1/3 the customers x 3 times the price does not = same profits. Sheesh.

Bar menu ended up being much more reasonable and the food was actually pretty good. I split a &#34;flight&#34; of little sandwiches with my pal: little prime rib (x2), little hamburger with chipotle mayo, little pulled pork. Green bean fries were yum. But lack of waitstaff and customers added up to a disturbing ghost-town atmosphere and slow service... can&#39;t say I&#39;m anxious to return soon."

The bartender and the waitress was talking and the bar tender finally took my drink order and asked if I wanted a menu. Uhh, yeah. I wanted a bone-in rib eye which was $34.95 supposedly 21 days dry aged. They also had a &#34;special&#34; Delmonico boneless rib eye but I wanted the bone-in for the flavor. It eventually came and it was a boneless. When I called them on it they came up with the lamest BS story of how some bone-in rib eyes have bones and some don&#39;t. This was hysterical. I happen to know the anatomy of cows and the various cuts of steaks and Instead of going all Gordon Ramsay on them, I just laughed and went with it. I&#39;ll just vote with my wallet and never go back. There&#39;s a reason guys why it was a ghost town at 8:00 pm on a holiday weekend and the Funky Monk across the street was packed (I went there afterwards) and could barely get a seat at the bar.

I have nothing but great things to say about the entire experience. The service was amazing and similar to what I would expect to get from a place like Trotters in the city. The quality and taste of the food was amazing. The atmosphere was relaxing and inviting. Even the prices were quite inexpensive compared to places with the same offerings. Overall, this place is amazing. I have no clue why this was rated 2 1/2 stars overall. Seriously, I spent under $70 for plates that should have been an easy $50 a piece on top of getting drinks an desert in my total bill.

Finally, on a Saturday afternoon we decided to make a special trip to try the beer at this place that proclaimed itself a brewery on the sign by the street.

The atmosphere was nice. The hostess sat us inside by a window as we requested. There were also nice tables outside in a shaded courtyard, but we preferred to observe from air conditioned comfort.

The first thing we asked the waiter was of course what beers they had on tap. There was no beer menu with detailed descriptions of the beers as I am accustomed to seeing at places that brew their own beer.
The waiter quickly went through the list:
pale ale, pilsner, amber ale, dark lager... commercial brew #1... I stopped him there to save time.

It was interesting that he described the dark lager as being &#34;not too heavy even though it is dark&#34;. My hopes were starting to sink at this point, because it started to look like this was not a beer lovers place.

I ordered the amber ale and my wife chose the dark lager. They were both served in tall pilsner glasses.

There was no noticeable aroma as I brought the glass to my nose. My first sip of the amber ale left me disappointed, but that wasn&#39;t my final judgment. I soldiered on and kept trying it. I wanted to like it, but there just wasn&#39;t any flavor to this beer. The watery character and carbonation reminded me of the typical macro brews, although this beer was amber colored rather than the typical macro yellow.

At the same time, my wife was having a similar experience with the dark lager. I tried her beer as well (just for research purposes of course) and I was surprised at how similar it tasted to my amber ale. Other than a slightly more bitter flavor, I would be hard pressed to tell them apart in a blind taste test.

We gave up on the beer at this point. We just didn&#39;t have any confidence that the other two choices were going to be significantly better than what we had already tried.

While all this disappointing beer tasting was going on we did order food. The macaroni and cheese with crab and asparagus was very tasty and was served at a good temperature. We paired that with a lemon oregano chicken wrap. The wrap was fair, but the flavor was very mild for something with lemon and oregano in it.

I am unlikely to return to Millrose any time soon. The beer was extremely disappointing to me. The food was pretty good, but a little on the expensive side. I guess prices are going up everywhere, so this isn&#39;t surprising, but since I am looking for good beer, that is the deal breaker."

My wife finds it offensive when the maître d&#39; greets us with &#34;Hi guys&#34;.  She is clearly not a guy.  When seated we were only given appetizer menus, we saw a couple leave as there was nothing they wanted from that menu and they were not even offered a dinner menu.  An ad in the newspaper listed a mid-week rib special was not on the menu, not on the special list and we probably would not have gotten had we not asked for it.  The ribs were great, our server was excellent, attentive without hovering.  They need to bring back lunch service, at least during summer hours during the week."

So my wife and a couple of our friends ended up at the Millrose after visiting Goebert&#39;s Farm.  Although we all dress funny and we&#39;re from the big scary city, we know how to act in public.  

We ended up here because there were few options that weren&#39;t totally disgusting, such as the IHOP down the street.  We thought it was going to be a little less classy and little more... Cracker Barrel. Come on, they have a country store.  You&#39;d make the same mistake.

When we walked in, we realized this was the type of place grandparents go on wedding anniversaries and people visit after services at Willow Creek.  Whatever, we like food and we all have jobs and we&#39;re productive members of society, despite being a little goofy looking.  We were seated and our waitress was less than pleased that she had to serve us.  When I&#39;m in this situation, where I know I&#39;m being judged, I tend to be really polite and out going.  Kill the stereotype that punks are shitty people.  

We all order burgers, not because it was the cheapest thing on the menu, but because holy crap, the burgers have cranberries on them.  The waitress was really bummed that we got burgers and cokes, rather than entrees and drinks.  Sorry, half our group was straight edge and I didn&#39;t feel like drinking.  

The burger was fan-freakin&#39;-tastic.  Perfectly cooked on PUMPERNICKEL.  Seriously, that&#39;s why this place got stars.  The bill came and instead of putting the $100.00 bill on our card and collect the cash, we asked our waitress to put the difference on our card.  Yeah, it&#39;s a pain in the ass and if you don&#39;t want to do it, say so.  We&#39;ll be big kids and suck it up and deal.  Nope, she takes the pile of money and our card, comes back with a smaller pile of money and our card.  Not noticing that the pile-o-cash was shorter, we look at the receipt and realize she put the whole bill on our card.  No big deal, we&#39;re adults.  We&#39;ll make the trip to the bank with the cash.  Whatever.  What we realize on our drive home, that our waitress had possibly pocketed a chunk-o-cash, because there was less in hand than what our friends contributed.  

Here&#39;s the thing, I don&#39;t stiff people on tips.  No matter how good or bad the service is.  Really, the service was alright, despite disapproving looks from waitress.  The atmosphere was even cozy.  But don&#39;t pocket money as a tip without asking.  Especially after you mention that you added an 18% gratuity.  Had you played ball, you would have gotten 20%, or we would have even left you a couple bucks, despite the added gratuity.  

If that&#39;s how they do business, well, I&#39;d say I&#39;ll never go there again, but seriously, when am I going to end up in Barrington?  Sure, it was probably our mistake for assuming she&#39;d be honest and for complicating things, but seriously, communicate with your customers.  They might surprise you."

The rest of the place looked really nice.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll come back for the food, maybe just to have a couple beers in the bar.

The food was sub par I had the Tilapia with crab and mozzarella cheese on top.  All I could taste was the cheese and who knows maybe it wasn&#39;t Tilapia because I couldn&#39;t taste it!  

The good news is, is that all of their beers were from my favorite Illinois brewery.  Two Brothers!!  I was able to order a beer for my entire family which I think they enjoyed more than the food."

It just wasn&#39;t good at all. It tasted like they were boiled and baked. Way too tender. The meat fell off the bone and you were able to swallow it without chewing. The meat was complete mush. The coleslaw was just nasty. Dessert was the Kahlua Lava Cake. It didn&#39;t taste like there was any Kahlua in it. For my wife and I, the bill was $90.00. I want a refund!

We came back a few years ago (because I had a entertainment coupon, or restaurant.com or some such) and it was disappointing. It was so expensive for okay food. Bummer. And they tried to argue about my coupon. However... I wrote the restaurant and the manager was very apologetic and sent me a gift card... so we tried again. Three drinks in the bar... $25 gift card.... $27 for the drinks. Really? Agh!

Fast forward to last month. Four of us stopped in for a cocktail after dining out at Wildfire in Schaumburg. The bar was not very crowded...at all. There was a band (blues mostly) and we really enjoyed them. We also enjoyed the fact that they had $4 margaritas and decent priced upscale beers. 8 drinks for under $40... nice. We didn&#39;t eat, so I can&#39;t comment, but it was nice to see they had some reasonable specials. 

The upper balcony area and side area in the bar were closed off (as is cloth draping) which was weird.... made it feel small in there. It&#39;s such a large, beautiful, ski-lodge feeling place usually. I guess I might give it one last try since they are regularly on restaurant.com (which usually says something in my book) for dinner. I do remember loving their french lamb chops (just not the greasy potato side dish that accompanied it). I know they were supposed to be famous for their meats (pork particularly?) but I gotta say, I make better ribs.... any day. Not sure if that&#39;s still their forte, but it never should have been.

So, what you really go for is the atmosphere... ski-lodge, fireplaces, lots of wood. I&#39;m holding my opinion on the food until we try dinner again."

I remember this place as crazy busy where you needed reservation to get a table. I also remember fantastic selection of food. 
Let me tell you - this was nothing like what I remember! Place was almost empty at ten in the morning on Sunday. But I am not surprised - the food was just what you would expect in a cheap neighborhood diner - very limites selection and completely nothing worth mentioning. No choices for people on any kind of diet, two bagel choices, nothing you would consider healthy. But the icing on the cake was the price - it was ridiculously high - even though we had nothing from the special menu - just plain smorgasboard serve yourself deal - we got charged like for a fancy dinner in a fancy restaurant - I certainly got a sticker shock when it came to paying.
So, if you want a toast, an egg, and a sausage link for the price of filet mignon that is your place. What the hell happened to the Milrose from ten years ago!!"

The one thing I did enjoy was that they will make you omelettes any way you want, on the spot. That is something I enjoy, as rudimentary as it is.

We sat in their outside/porch area... the sun was in our eyes for about 10 minutes, but then it was quite pleasant. The awning works, but the umbrella tables don&#39;t have tilting umbrella, or staff who knows how to tilt them, so for an hour or two before sunset, you should be careful which table you accept.

Our waiter was friendly and made good suggestions about his &#34;Top 3&#34; favorites from the menu. A manager, I assume, tried to come over and strike up a conversation with us, but we were kind of deep in our own at the time... but points for trying, I guess.

I had a Fish and Chips (Friday special) which was really good... and I&#39;m happy to report that it kept me from feeling starved for the next 12 hours (fasting for some blood work the next morning). We also had the Pot Roast, a Ribs &amp; Chicken plate, a burger and I think the Prime Rib. Everyone enjoyed their meal quite a bit.

We were fairly full, but decided to get a few of their &#34;mini&#34; desserts anyway, and they were really excellent. I know one was a vanilla creme brulee, but I did not try that, as I believe it disappeared before I could. I don&#39;t remember which one it was that I had a bite of, but it was good stuff."

It&#39;s all wood decor, with so many different levels, which makes it nice and cozy.   The second thing was &#34;it&#39;s Saturday dinner time.  Where is everyone?&#34;  We had a large group, about 30 people, but didn&#39;t need to worry about a reservation.  They could&#39;ve fit five more of our groups in there without worry, it was that empty.

Then we got the menus.  I wish I&#39;d taken my hostess&#39; advise and checked this out on the website before I came, because I was not expecting the prices for a place so far out in the suburbs.  There were very few dishes under around $25, and this did not seem to be the sort of place to justify the expense.  The menu wasn&#39;t very extensive, and while there seemed to be one of each kind of dish (with a more extensive steak menu), if you didn&#39;t want to spent $25+ for your meal your options were VERY limited.  I pretty much had to choose between a burger, a pasta dish, or the tilapia.  The description of how they prepared the tilapia sounded bland, but the pork sounded yummy, with an apple glaze, pecans, a sweet potato, and vegetables.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t like pork.  So, at my request, and to their credit (although I got disapproving stares from the waitress and she asked me several times if I was sure), they gave me the tilapia with the pork glaze on the side to give it more flavor (unfortunately, they forgot the pecans).   The resulting tilapia was pretty decent, but the sweet potato was tiny and, along with the vegetables, surprisingly flavorless.  I&#39;ve had far better elsewhere, and for less money.  And MUCH better service.

On top of the meal, I had a gin and tonic.  That is the most I&#39;ve ever paid for a G&amp;T, despite the fact that I&#39;m often at clubs in the city, and it was in a tiny glass.  Also, when I asked the waitress if she would recommend a white or red wine with my meal, she had no idea.  She was nice, but definitely would&#39;ve fit in more with a breakfast diner than a $30+ per plate restaurant in the suburbs.

So, bottom line... Overpriced far-west suburban restaurant with great atmosphere, okay food, expensive drinks, and mediocre service.  Just a few miles east, there are far better restaurants that, despite their location, have better prices and more extensive menus."

The restaurant has a warm, cozy feel to it and seems wholesome and family oriented. 
The food is very Americana. Its the kind of food an American mom would make for you but upgraded. They also have a great selection of drinks. 

However, for the prices, I was expecting a bit more of a presentation of the food. I ordered the tilapia but you&#39;d never know it from just looking at it. It just seemed like everything was thrown on the plate-my sauce was running everywhere. The Tilapia was buried under the sauce, crab meat and cheese. It seemed the same with the other dishes my guests had. In their defense, I guess it does play to the &#34;feel at home&#34; theme. Though, the quality of the food did seem alright.

Service was great. My Uncle is usually a difficult person to deal with at restaurants but they handled him gracefully. Our server seemed very friendly and patient with our large group.

Sampled both appetizers and the shrimp bruschetta was delightful while the Italian sausage stuffed mushrooms only edible because they smothered in a red sauce.  The black bean cuban soup was good but lacked spice. The pan-seared chicken and veggies with gnocchi was great! The espresso martini out of this world.  Dessert.....ordered the waffle with gelato.....had hope.  Since it was nearing 7 we asked for our bill and desserts to go.  Got our bill.  Never saw the desserts 10 minutes later....had no choice but to leave.  Hope someone ate them.  The waitress was nice but must have had a million tables because we barely saw her.  

Won&#39;t return, but wouldn&#39;t tell you not to try the bar.....seriously, the DRINKS ARE AMAZING!!!!"

Our server was horrible. She had three tables, including us, in her section and she couldn&#39;t manage it. It took her a long time to get our drinks out and then she brought out the bread after the appetizers right before we got our meal.

My boyfriend and I both got the burgers and she didn&#39;t even know which temperature was which. We had to send back the one because it wasn&#39;t medium rare, but more medium well. She then brings it back and says I think it is much closer to medium now. Uh what? Well that would be fine if medium was the temperature we ordered. We didn&#39;t want to deal with it so we just shut our mouth and ate it. Burgers sucked, the appetizers weren&#39;t anything special. Overall blah.

Oh and this server really needs to learn some manners. She kept reaching across us without saying excuse me and took the check right out from under us while we were talking. Save yourself the money and don&#39;t spend it at this overpriced odd ball restaurant."

I&#39;ve stopped in for drinks a few years ago, but was very curious about the food.

I put in for reservations earlier in the day, and got seated right away.  It wasn&#39;t very busy at this point, but our server took some time to get our drink orders.  After our drinks were served, the server mentioned that we were going to be served by someone else that would take our food order.  15 minutes after our drinks came in, our food order had finally been taken by the new server.  By this point, we were starving.

My girlfriend had the Top Sirloin and I had the Cajun Chicken Penne.  The Cajun Chicken Penne was fantastic!  It was a tangy combination of penne pasta, andouille sausage, well-prepared chicken and a great sauce.  As for my girlfriend, the food was great, but they did not give her the Bearnaise sauce that was supposed to be with the steak.  And of all things, a steak knife wasn&#39;t given with the plate.  The butter-knife hardly made a dent, so after waiting a while for our waiter to swing by, we just asked a nearby busboy for a steak knife.

Overall, the food and drinks were really enjoyable.  The reoccurring problem just seemed to be the service on this particular night.  We did get comped a round of beers after the server noticed our small frustrations, so it was nice to see that they noticed and cared about the customer.  Either way, with the prices on the menu and the service, it may be sometime before we stop back in."

My wife and her mother,my daughter and a close friend went to this establishment on the night of the snow storm February 10, 2012.  We traveled an hour and a half for the entertainment that was offered that night along with a limited menu, wine included.  We had no idea what the food was going to be like.  We were pleasently surprized to find that the beef shortribs and the olive,artichoke stuffed chicken breast were 5 star quality.  The wine chosen to fit the meal was excellant.  The Millrose had this event in a private diningroom, but I was able to see the main room and the bar as we entered the establishmnet.  Cozy describes this place, sound does not travel far in their rooms. The bar was interesting to say the least.  The private room was complete with fireplace and deck out for Valentines Day.  Our friend said that it reminded her of a Vale Colorado ski lodge, mountain rustic I would call it.  It was very pleasent to me.  The staff were exceptional and more than willing to please in their service. I have no qualms about recomending this establishment for its food and circuses.  The entertainment that night was Opera and Love Songs by Diva Montell and Jerge Holmes.  The food and entertainment were worth that horrible drive in the winter storm.  We were all glad we attended this event.

I did notice a Country Store attached to this restaurant.  It was closed, but I think it would be worth the trip to check it out.  I have read the other reviews and beg to disagree with them.  I have no reason to doubt others experience here, so the likely situation is that this restaurant has improved its self and deserves a second look for them and a first look for those of you who have never been here to eat and drink.  By the way, I understand that Diva Montell will be returning here to sing in a few weeks.  That is when I plan to return and will be better for it, too."

I have never heard anything good about this place. I was &#34;delighted&#34; when I was taken here against my will. 

It was post-lunchtime, on a Saturday. There could not have been more than 10 other people in there. The hostess was busy talking to someone about how she needed her break, while we were ignored for a few minutes. We were seated, eventually, and had plenty of time to peruse the short, uninteresting menu. 

I decided on the ELEVEN dollar club. I was delirious and overheated....please cut me some slack. 

The server was adequate. Nothing more, nothing less. 

This eleven dollar joke of a club sandwich comes to the table. Tomato slices so thick you wonder if they just cut the stem and halved the darn thing...2 foot stacks of lettuce, uneven piles of not-great-turkey, and ONE piece of bacon....TOTAL. I am sorry, the word bacon got me, not bacos. Please, dont try to sprinkle a dash of bacos or beggin strips or what ever that was on a sammich and call it bacon. No. 

Dry bread. No offer of mustard, or mayo, or even a warning that this &#34;artisan&#34; bread will be so dry that it will julienne slice your esophagus. Sweet. 

There were 10 or so french fries on my plate. They were good. Go figure. 

Bastard sandwich + tomato halves + non-bacon + 10 fries + razor bread =/= 11.00 


It was a total ripoff. I will not be back for any reason."

This is the restaurant we found during a downpour. He was happy with his margarita, and I was happy with his asiago filled potato things. I had some sorta chicken thing, and it was OK. 
Mostly this review is for the drinks and that one side dish, though he claimed his steak was cooked to his liking. 

I&#39;d definitely go again, if only for tequila and potato filled happiness."

I can honestly say it was the worst food I have EVER tasted.  I would have said something but I did not want to make a fuss in front of my friend who I was treating to lunch.   I ordered the special, which was shaved roast beef.  It must have been cooked days before and heated up.  It had a gardenia topping (dreadful, just warmed over  &#39;ketchup like&#39; sauce.)  Even the french fries were cooked hours earlier and heated up.  This huge facility was almost empty at noon and I can certainly see why.  I don&#39;t expect the lunch &#39;special&#39; to be fantastic but I do expect to be able to eat it.  Be warned!"

We&#39;ve been on a mission to only eat at places we haven&#39;t been to yet, so we decided to have the Sunday brunch. I drive by this place all the time and a lot of people in my family love it, so we figured, why not. What is it with hostesses lately who are too busy to look up and greet you? Uh, this is your job! I don&#39;t expect a red carpet roll out or anything, but how about a nice &#34;Hi! How ya doin&#39;?&#34; when I approach the hostess stand? I swear! We seriously waited at least a minute until we were even acknowledged and it wasn&#39;t like there was a ton of people waiting to be sat. 

The atmosphere was country farm house. This seems like a place with mostly older clientele. We were seated overlooking the outdoor patio and it looked really nice. Lots of fireplaces in here....I bet it would be nice when it&#39;s cold outside. 

The food was average at best. I know when we go to an all you can eat buffet, our expectations are low, but come on! At least keep the food looking nice when the tray is half empty! There was just one guy overlooking the whole room and he was also the meat slicer at the carving station which had ham and turkey.  Normal breakfast fare - eggs benedict, corned beef hash, waffles, french toast, country potatoes, cheese blintzes (made with large curd cottage cheese!?!?!), and scrambled eggs. There was a toaster they put out with a bread basket and some of their homemade jellies and a platter of lox, which I always look forward to, but it was all slimy and looked like it had been sitting out a long time. There was also oatmeal, a lot of fresh fruit and boxes of cold cereal and the pastry table of which nothing even looked good. I tried a &#34;cannoli&#34; and it was soggy and sad.  At $20 a person, I think they could have done a much better job.

Our server was nice enough, and I can see this being a nice place to come for a big family event or something, but I would not recommend it for the Sunday brunch."

On a Sunday night it was mostly empty and we were able to choose where we wanted to sit.  The food here is fairly standard, and we both chose the Prime Rib, a weekend offering.  This came with a baked potato and a side of green beans (not the Broccoli listed on the menu - a good thing as they were great).  We tried both sizes, and the meat was done perfectly.   Service from the &#34;sweet older lady&#34; was both competent and effiicient.  We finished with a 3 part &#34;Mini Deserts&#34; plate that was a good selection.  Prices can be rather high - the large Prime Rib is about $32 including the 2 sides."

I have to admit, being a beer guy, I was a little disappointed to find out they no longer brewed their own beer (it had been a couple years since we had been there), however, the rest of our experience made up for that.  My wife and I waited in the bar area for the rest of our party to show up.  They had some sort of special going on, so there were a few people waiting in the host area.  We thought we&#39;d get a drink and wait for everyone.  We were greeted by Allfredo, the friendly bartender.  The bar wasn&#39;t too busy, so we chatted at the bar for awhile, and Allfredo mixed up some great dirty martinis, with bleu cheese olives, my wife&#39;s favorite.  After the rest of our party showed up, we were escorted to the table, which was in a perfect location, away from most of the patrons. We had the pork tacos and the sampler platter as appetizers, and everyone thought the tacos were unique and tasty.  For our entrees, I ordered the pork chop, and it was divine!  My wife had the whitefish, and had plenty left over for the next day.  My in-laws had the ribs, and they said they were some of the best (although I didn&#39;t get a chance to try them). It was my mother-in-law&#39;s birthday, our great server, Laura, made sure to bring out a complimentary piece of cake, and that of course made my mom-in-law feel special!  Both the service and food were excellent! This was a great time had by all, and we will surely be back for the next family get-together!"

I was at the bar with a friend during the weeknight, so it wasn&#39;t too crowded.

The bar tender was very friendly and let me sample a few drinks before buying it.  I also enjoyed some of the live music being played in the background, set a nice vibe.

For food I ordered the sampler platter of appetizers  (forget the exact name).  Overall food wise, I was not too impressed.  The only thing I liked on the platter were the potato skins, everything else was either too dry or did not have enough flavor.  I was especially disappointed with the ribs.

Despite the food experience, I would definitely come back here again and try another meal."

I had the veggie fajitas. Limited vegetarian options- but still I can see myself going back. Had a classy feel to it, prices definitely on the expensive side. I should probably take off 2 stars for the crappy server and the horrible job at packing the food she did. But whatever-I had great company so the horrible server didnt bother me as much. If I wanted crappy service, I would have eaten at Burger King. This place needs to do a serious make-over of their staff."

Maybe my recent move to the Chicago area is giving me sticker shock at the prices of eating out here.  The lunch menu is essentially the dinner menu. They have a breakfast buffet when we were there on Sunday. But we wanted to eat the real fare so we opted for the dinner menu instead.

The ambiance of the Millrose is rich and cozy. And the patio is charming. Wicker chairs sit facing each other by the fireplace. There&#39;s even piano music on Friday and Saturday nights, according to their literature.

Prices start at $9 for appetizers. We had the Taste of Millrose appetizers that contain 3 coconut shrimp (not bad), Italian sausage and bratwurst (nicely herbed and flavored), meatballs, spicy wings, ribs, potato skins, and onion straws. It&#39;s definitely a good sampling of what Millrose has to offer. 

Our table had the jumbo lump crab cakes served with roasted pepper-corn relish and spicy remoulade sauce. The presentation is pretty and the crab cakes delectable. But not the best I&#39;d eaten. I thought Ted&#39;s Montana Grill&#39;s was better. 

The husband had the Rose&#39;s Ribs and Chicken. He opted for the bbq chicken instead of the herb-roasted chicken. He enjoyed both. And we all loveddddd the mashed potatoes. A little lumpy and oh so smooth.

I had the pot roast. I wasn&#39;t too excited when I tasted the tomato-based jus. It must be a regional flavor. I&#39;d never had pot roast cooked in this manner until arriving here. Ritzy&#39;s had the same treatment to their pot roast. But I was willing to overlook that and dissect the rest of the pot roast. The meat was tender and flavorful. You can certainly tell the difference between their meat and the hormon-injected ones sold at supermarkets. The sauce has hints of a good red wine. The carrots are hit or miss, in terms of texture. For $20, it was steep. 

Eating at the Millrose is not cheap, and I won&#39;t be returning anytime soon because of that. I may, however, be picking some of their meats at the country store should the husband and I plan to indulge in a good cookout at home.

*Photos shot

It&#39;s a great experience. Just be prepared to spend.

You can buy most of the meats in their country store, and the prices run high."

We brought out of town visitors, hoping to have an entertaining evening; it was anything but. We waited twenty minutes just to have a drink order taken, yet the server had time to get dessert orders and bring checks to the remaining three tables in the dining area. Asked about a children&#39;s&#39; menu which she said she couldn&#39;t give because they were out - only wanted to know what FOOD was on them. She had to go look to see and came back ten minutes later and STILL didn&#39;t know. Manager came over and didn&#39;t do much, no apology, nothing. Tried to order wine. Of the three we picked out, server told us they were out. Would have been nice to know BEFORE we opened the list! Food was lackluster and the menu has become boring and bland.

Menu was pretty plain and simple and everyone in my party seemed to enjoy their nice, standard food.  The fries were fresh and tasty - to my personal disgust, I ate them all.

I, however, was very surprised when I had my lemon chicken.  It was very tasty, and it had a ton of flavors and ingredients that I would not have expected in a place like this - ex. tzatziki, hummus, cracked wheat. 

Extra points for surprising me!"

Its old and outdated and their food isnt great. Had a waitress once that was a nightmare and very rude. I believe that&#39;s when I stopped coming here. My company has held meetings here in their meeting rooms - OLD AND OUTDATED. Almost has a cigar smoke smell to it...I dont know. I cant stand this place anymore.

They just make it too hard.  I made an Open Table reservation for 6:15 on a Sunday night.  They were not crowded yet it took a good five minutes to be seated.  The host just plain seemed lost.  He asked if we would like a wine list.  My wife said she did.  Yet no wine list ever arrived.  We had to ask three times for children&#39;s menus.  I had the NY Strip and my wife had the grilled jumbo shrimp.  Both were very good.  My eldest had the children&#39;s chicken strips.  The child portion was large and he liked it.  My youngest ordered noodles with butter sauce and cheese. When they came, no butter, no parm.  Not to worry, our waitress provided the same butter they use for rolls and we got to melt it ourselves on the noodles.  Aside from that, our service was good but not great.

Foremost, they are NOT a brewery, a fact which would have deterred me from purchasing the gift certificate to begin with.    

Given my apprehensions, the food was better than I expected, but still decidedly NOT very good, especially at this price.  Sampled fare was a smoked pork chop special and the burger.  Given it&#39;s origin in meat-packing, I was kind of surprised that the burger was as flat as it was.  The smoked pork chop was juicy and flavorful, but that burger was just sad (in addition to not being cooked as requested).

On the other hand, the space (especially the bar)  was well decorated with autumnal stuff and they feature other microbrews on the menu, just not their own.  I might consider it a place for a big event.

If I lived in the area and didn&#39;t have other actual breweries or places for great meat / ambiance I would go back.  But for now I consider it to be a case of bate &amp; switch :("

What happened to this place? This used to be a great spot to eat a few years back. We wanted a nice dinner after my son&#39;s graduation and I thought of Millrose.

 When I worked out this way, I&#39;d eaten here both for lunch and dinner. They had great food, a friendly busy bar and the place was packed. We get here on a Sunday late afternoon/early evening and there&#39;s nobody eating in the place. I had thought we might have had to wait for a table.

We get a meager paper type of menu and I don&#39;t even see the roast pork dinner that they were known for. The breadholder is cute and dainty but only held about 5 pieces of bread and there were six of us and hungry, so as we ordered drinks and appetizers I asked for  more bread when he bought the drinks. My ex-wife also asked him for bread as well, not having heard me ask....she&#39;s learned to tune me out long ago. Anyway, back he comes with the drinks - no bread. I asked him about it and he replied. &#34;Oh, you&#39;d like more bread?&#34; Now the kid was nice, but he wasn&#39;t very competent. Besides that he was giving each person the others drink. It happens sometimes, but not a great sign.

 The calamari appetizer was good but tiny. We had some kind of chorizo taco thing which was actually bland. How do you make chorizo bland?
I saw that they offered prime rib blackened which I&#39;ve had at other places, and it can be very good. When it came, it was a flat piece of shoe leather. I&#39;m serious now. If someone told me that they had accidentally cooked their shoe and put it on my plate I would have believed it. I asked for it medium rare and it was well well well done - toast. He explained that it was due to me ordering it blackened. Apparently th chef didn&#39;t study in Paris, as I explained the process. Honestly, I&#39;m 59 years old and that;s the first time I remember sending a dish back immediately. To their credit, they brought me out a new one (unblackened per my new request) in like two minutes. It was satisfactory. My daughter asked that the giardanera for her spicy chicken sandwich be on the side, but nope. It was plopped right on it. My son and ex-wife said their chicken dinner was not bad except for the stuffing.

IMy son and I saw the pistachio cake with gelato dessert and we ordered it. My daughter had the carrot cake and enjoyed it, but neither me or my son could finish the cardboard that was our dessert. How do you screw up gelato? It tasted like they gave us a wax demo model.

My only thought after this was....very obviously different owners from what I remember. It was a huge disappointment on a special occasion. I prefer to write the kind reviews, but I hope to save some other poor soul from a bad evening."

I went there a lot when I was younger, but then my family stopped going.  We went, probably for the first time in 5 years, for old times sake for my mother&#39;s birthday.

I&#39;m probably still too angry to write a coherent review, so I will simply relay my experience.  Keep in mind this was early on a monday night and we were probably one of ten tables in the restaurant. 

The experience was as follows:
6:00: Arrive for reservation and our group of 6 is seated at a huge circular table that should have seated 10-12.
6:10 waitress takes drink orders, runs away before entrees can be ordered.
6:25  drinks come to the table, entrees are ordered
6:50 salad arrives
7:10 entrees arrive
7:50 waitress finally picks up and returns check

We were seated right outside of the kitchen door (yet another terrible choice given that we could have been seated anywhere in the restaurant) so I don&#39;t know where the waitress was hiding.  

This is why we had stopped coming before, and why I will never go again (if a manager read this review today and called me to offer a free repeat dinner I would decline).  Food was good, not great, and the ambiance was a pleasant upscale rustic.  So I had to give it more than 1 star.  But like I said, I&#39;m never going back, not even if they were giving it away for free."

Same as the$10 special during the week i guess,but for double the price.small rack small side.I just dont know how anyone could like these.They were made the day before,baked,then baked again and who knows maybe 3 times,tasted old. The meat fell onto my plate as i picked them up. covered in an overly sweet wallpaper paste of a BBQ sauce.PATHETIC!! Made sweet baby rays seem bland.From top to bottom,this place needs someone with knowledge to purchase product,someone to design a menu,AND SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO COOK THE MENU!!!"

Took my son out after Graduation on a Sunday evening at 4:30pm and the place was dead! There were only 2 other groups. Our reservations were for 5pm. They had us wait so they could set us up at a different table since we were early. Not sure why when the place was empty. We only saw 2 other groups come in by the time we left.
So let&#39;s start with the seating, there were 8 of us. They put us at a long table that seated 10. One side was a booth type set up so those that were there had to get up and move all 4 of us to let the first one in , out! Not very accomodating for chatting.
The appetizers they brought to to the table, crudites, were dried out. The radishes looked like there were there for days, even brown around the edges. I didn&#39;t taste the bread.
Equally disappointing was the food. Not worth the higher end prices. I had parmesan crusted chicken. The meal came with soup or salad, I chose salad. Nothing to write home about. The garlic mashed potatoes were good however there portion was huge! The food order seemed to take way too long (we were there over 2 hours). I will say there menu was not impressive. Maybe thats why it took us so long, everyone was trying to decide what to have since it consisted of a legal sized one sided menu. 
The service was no overly great, average I would say. Had it not been for the saving grace of a $75 gift card, I would have been angry. My son was not thrilled either. 
Definitely will not be coming back here."

We were seated by the large windows that lead to the outdoor seating. At first I was hesitant to sit by the windows because it was cold, but, it was snowing those huge beautiful snow clusters that slowly drift down... it really added to the overall ambiance and I&#39;m glad I had the view. 
The food was good. Nothing super special, the typical breakfast fare but all of it was prepared well."

I went here with my husband and my 3 sons, along with my parents. We enjoyed the decor and our waitress was friendly, however, there were alot of things that turned me off about this place. First off- the rest rooms are located right off of a main hallway that leads to where our table was. The entire time we were there, there was a STRONG odor of poop wafting through the hallway. It was absolutely disgusting. When I got up to actually use the bathroom, it was so intensely awful smelling that it reminded me of a very full cat&#39;s litter box that had been left I scooped for too long.  The food was not very good at all. Not horrible, but nothing special. The beer that they brought out in tasting glasses from their brewery was not very flavorful. A few were like a stronger version of a miller lite. All of them tasted like mildew. My husband thought that perhaps they weren&#39;t cleaning out the lines often enough. Either way, gross. This place is huge. It seems to go on forever and there is ample seating for hundreds of people. So here is what really sealed the deal and ensured that we would never return again. As we were getting ready to leave, a hostess (I&#39;m assuming that was her job title) approached our table and said, &#34;Hi, I don&#39;t usually do this but we&#39;ve had a group of people waiting for about half an hour now for this table&#34;. Are you kidding me. The place was empty! There were at least 60 other tables that these people could have been seated at. Not to mention, we werent even there for that long! It wasnt lkle we were hanging around for hours. I was in total shock. We left and vowed to never return again. So avoid the mediocre food, crappy tasteless beer, shit fumes wafting across your table and beyond rude service..... Go somewhere else. Anywhere else. Haha."

Martinis came and I thought they had brought us doubles by mistake...big!
Wine list had decent selections. Seemed like the less expensive wines were marked up higher than more expensive ones. Some good values at higher end if you want a nicer wine. Coppola Rose was  wonderful dry Rhone style rose with our mussels.
We had no beer at the brewery.
The food:
Seafood chowder was nicely seasoned and not starched into sludge. But seafood was overcooked and chewy. Their version of Caesar salad wasn&#39;t so great. Canned artichoke hearts and seasoning of tomatoes didn&#39;t go well with the ordinary Caesar dressing.
Special was Prince Edward Island mussels. Outstanding! Tender, sweet mussels in herbal broth with scallions. The base of tomatoes and bread, my wife and I split over...she loved and I liked but thought it was a some unneeded flavors.
Pistachio gelato tart(?) was marvelous. Tons of pistachios on gelato with right amount of chocolate in graham cracker -like crunchy crust. Much better than I&#39;ve described.
Enjoyable dining with a couple weak spots."

They&#39;ve closed down their outdoor bar (pity, it used to be a lot of fun!). Their &#34;re-configured&#34; bar/banquet hall area is terrible--dark, enclosed, feels unfriendly.

For many years, Millrose used to be one of our weekly spots for lunch, and for the occasional after work cocktail. After some management changes a couple of years ago, their food declined to sub-standard, their menu shrank, and their service was appalling. So, we vowed to never again step inside... Fast forward to today, Thought, &#34;well, it&#39;s been a couple of years, let&#39;s give Millrose another try...&#34; Here&#39;s the story of that experience:

It was 75 degrees outside, preferred to sit outside anyway, so we moved from the bar to the &#34;restaurant&#34; section to be seated alfresco. They did not honor their 1/2-priced appetizer special--apparently their &#34;computers&#34; were not programmed that way... Manager was a clown. Decent and attentive waitress service (until the end). Ironically, my friend tried to pay with credit card, but after a long wait and mounting attitude from the servers, we ended up going to the bar to pay with cash and then move on to the next establishment for dinner.

We did enjoy a 1/2-priced bottle of wine from their expensive wine list. The $28 dollar Pinot Noir was had for $14 (which usually retails for less than $12, so no favors, there).

There are many great restaurants in Chicagoland--this is not one of them. Save your bucks and go somewhere else!

Once home for the evening and knowing that their manager was not interested in our lack-luster experience, tried to send upper-management my comments directly from their website; I guess  the &#34;contact us&#34; page was also not interested in hearing our story as it was giving error messages!"

It turned out to be a good venue for this kind of thing. Although the room we were in was dark, it had a warm and rustic feeling. The service was unnoticed (which is just how it should be at an event - not intrusive, but available and you rarely have to ask for anything). The food was above average for this kind of thing. Tender chicken with a nice gravy, great roasted veggies and fresh mashed potatoes. Great cheesecake as dessert. 
Not amazing, but couldn&#39;t find significant fault with anything."

There were only 2-3 tables and only one other one in our section. Two women and about 8 kids came in about 15 minutes after us. 

Our waitress was very attentive up until she took outlet order. She started tending to the other tables, never updated us on our food. Now, I was going to ask what the wait was but my boyfriend asked that I didn&#39;t...we got our food at 12:10. After the women and kids. The food arrived warm, I was upset and my boyfriend said &#34;It&#39;s okay&#34;...

My boyfriend asked for a well done steak, I like mine medium. On top of the steak being warm, it was medium. When the waitress came I told her what the order was and she stated that&#39;s what she asked for and she asked if we wanted another, I told her no. She told the manager who then came over and asked if our waitress offered to cook the steak longer?&#34; I stated &#34;yes,&#34; he said that he took the appetizers off of our order, which were onion rings and he apologized. 

The waitress brought us the check which I grabbed first and noticed the steak my boyfriend ordered was $18.99! Oh no, you most definitely didn&#39;t try to play us with taking off the appetizer! I told our waitress that deleting just the appetizer was unacceptable and a refund for the steak would be more feasible. 

Sorry to make a short story long. We were able to get the steak deleted from our total and will never return."

Appetizer was onion rings (amazing!!), hubs got the butchers meat and potatoes (he said it was good) however I got the 4 cheese Mac and cheese (chicken on top was good, however the pasta sauce was horrific, rendering it inedible). Waitress asked if I wanted a box, I said no because it was awful and had no intention of bringing it home. Got the bill and nothing was taken off. Shocked. At least allow the customer to get another entree, or take off a soup, something. We drove about an hour to come here, because of the gift card I had. Next time, just gonna re-gift it.

 The waitresses are great and friendly but the food and wait was under my standards. We waited an hour to receive things not prepared as ordered and low quality beef used. I&#39;ve been to many Applebees and this was my first bad experience.

Dirty dishes were not taken away unless you told them to take them. It&#39;s like common sense went out the window. The &#34;manager&#34; seems like he was 12 and was very inexperienced with how to handle unsatisfied customers.  Did not represent Applebee&#39;s appropriately. Excuses are not solutions.

We were seated immediately and greeted by our waitress right away. We got our drinks but had to ask for straws when she came back. We opted for the cheeseburger egg rolls and chicken wonton tacos. Both were great! We had to stack our plates and hand them to our waitress. So, service was off to a rocky start but then improved from this point on. I ordered the thai shrimp salad and my boyfriend got the oriental chicken salad. Our waitress refilled our drinks, checked in with us a couple times while we were waiting on our food and updated us with when it would be ready. We both really enjoyed our entrees, which the manager brought out since our waitress was taking orders at another table. Our waitress came to check on us and so did the manager. Definite team work amongst the workers, which is a good sign! We did order the blondie for dessert and loved it! Our waitress was very attentive the remainder of our visit and definitely made up for her rocky start! We had a good time and enjoyed the food and atmosphere, but I&#39;m not in a hurry to go back.

I asked my server why was I not told of the up charge, ????  Why !!!  Subbing out Onion rings for fries should not be a big deal,  When she asked me if I wanted to speak to a manager, I asked if it would make any difference, She said probably not...  I then asked her why she did not tell me of the additional charge.   Understand, It&#39;s not the additional money that bothers me, It&#39;s how many times do they do this to there customers with out telling them.

The table was actually ready before all the people arrived, so it worked out well.  I feel like they have really expanded their menu since my last trip to Applebee&#39;s.  It took a while to read through what they have.  There were good deals, like 2 for $20 where you can get a 3 course meal for 2 people or the pick 2 items for $11 or $12.

I went with the green goddess wedge salad and garlic rosemary chicken pasta for $10.99.  The wedge salad was great!  It came with a creamy dressing topped with blue cheese, bacon and nuts.  The pasta was also good.  The waitress asked if we were celebrating anything and we told her it was one of our friend&#39;s bday.

I have my reasons for liking Applesbee&#39;s. Their two for twenty deal is hard to beat . One appetizer and two entrees for twenty bucks is alright by me. Also, their perfect margarita is strong and delicious. Oh, and STRONG. Which is a bad idea in an area where there&#39;s practically no public transportation. 

Lastly though, why I was even willing to admit that I like this establishment is a particular appetizer they serve. Two words: wonton tacos. They are so good that it blows my mind that they are from Applebees. The crispy wontons, the delicious slaw. Mmm. Yes. I will take another order please.

Our waitress was very friendly and good.  She told us about the Happy Hour drink specials. Yes, drinks margarita&#39;s and yes they were very good, 2 for 1.

All of us ordered our food and it arrived hot with no problems.  I ordered the Club Sandwich with fries.  I adore club sandwiches and this sandwich was excellent.  Actually, all of our food was good. No complaints.

Good food, reasonable prices, fun place to have a few cocktails, with good service. Check, I would visit again."

So many employees were standing around or just being unprofessional.  We saw a group of servers standing in a circle talking.

The spinach dip must have come out of can.  It was thin and soupy and didn&#39;t have any taste.  The chicken and shrimp dish was also tasteless with a thick cloppy sauce that congealed on the shrimp.  This was served over a bed of some what greasy rice that had greasy sauted peppers and onion which were suppose to make this dish healthy.  Now I do have to give the high mark on the margarita but it would be nice to have the price listed so they is no surprise when you get the bill.   Also the staff was well trained although with all the &#34;have a nice day&#34; as we left made me think that everybody took a happy pill before they started work.

Typical chain restaurant food; frozen before by Sysco or some large distribution company, hard non-greasy fries, and well done burger when asked for a medium with pink in middle,(was the cooks fault like usual). OK.  The only reason I gave this restaurant so many stars is because of the outstanding service I had.  A short blonde girl, names Katie, was on top of her game.

Staff:  the staff was great!  I let him know I had never been there, so needed a little guidance on selecting and he did a great job letting me choose my food.

Food:  I had combo #1 which were a couple of hot dogs with fries and a drink.  The hot dogs and buns are nothing spectacular.  The condiments however were fresh and piled high on them.  The fries on the other hand were amazing!  They have to be just about the best fries I&#39;ve had!  I noticed they have a large selection of foods, so I will have to go back in there at some point to try the gyros or hamburgers, or just about anything.

Serving Hot Dogs, Burgers and Italian Beef sandwiches, the menu should be very familiar to most native Chicagoans. The inside of this particular eatery is fairly clean with a few tables on the inside, an R.C/ Nehi pop machine and a large counter with a menu board above it and a long grill where the food is prepared.

In visiting Grando&#39;s I was looking to add yet another location to my hot dog review list. I decided to order a hot dog along with a burger and fries combo. We&#39;ll go over the hot dog first. The hot dog I received came on a slightly dry non-poppy seed bun. The sausage itself was skinless and tasted like I would expect but the application of condiments here was a bit rough. There was a little too much mustard, and the dog was light on relish and onions by comparison. The pickle spear used was a tad on the sour side. On the plus side, the tomato used wasn&#39;t too soggy or too ripe. There wasn&#39;t any noticeable celery salt, nor any sport peppers on this hot dog. 

The burger I got also had a dry bun. In fact the bun had actually cracked a bit on the top. The burger meat itself was a bit on the greasy side with how it was grilled. I&#39;d say the meat was juicy and had a good flavor, but it didn&#39;t exactly knock my socks off. The condiments on the burger were fairly good but it&#39;s generally a far less delicate process than with a hot dog. The fries included were thin shoestring fries. They were crisp but didn&#39;t have a lot of potato paste in them. I&#39;d say they were a bit saltier than most fries.

Overall I wasn&#39;t too impressed with Grando&#39;s Beef and Hot Dogs. The prices were slightly higher than a lot of other fast food joints. I&#39;d say the burger was about average and the hot dog was a bit below average. I do wonder how they&#39;re storing their hamburger and hot dog buns as both of the ones I received were dry and cracking.  One other thing worth noting is that they appear to be closed on Sundays and only open from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM on Saturdays. Somewhat limited hours on the weekend which is a bit of an added inconvenience. Overall while my experience at Grando&#39;s wasn&#39;t terrible, the food was just slightly below average. This place is a borderline between two and three stars. The fact that both buns were dry,  is going to be the proverbial &#34;straw that broke the camels back&#34; and cause me to round them down to two stars."

This is my usual &#34;go-to&#34; when i can&#39;t figure out what i want as there is a wide variety of your typical hot dog joint menu items.

The burgers are excellent and the hot dogs are good (Red Hot Chicago).  Wasn&#39;t too thrilled with the gyro&#39;s, but I am pretty partial to Grecian Delight brand and i think these were OLympia. They tasted like more filler than meat.

however one day we went he was not working and we had someone different, unfortunately i can&#39;t remember his name. Our daughter likes to make a mess when we go to restaurants, and granted she is only 15 months. so she sits in a high chair and we normally let her have a cali roll or a veggie roll she feels like she is eating what we are. so naturally she destroys most of it and half always ends up on the floor. Now we are not those kind of parents to leave a big mess, so as we are finishing our meal i got down to clean up some of the stuff off the floor. Our server sees me and immediately comes to our table and says &#34;Please don&#39;t worry about that, you guys are here for a family dinner let us worry about the mess&#34;..... I have been to many places, and have never had better service then from the staff at Sushi Station.

A fair amount of selection and it all gets delivered to you via a rail system that carries tiny plates of sushi around the restaurant automatically. 
Each plate is color coded for price. Pink is $2, green is $4 as example. Most plates are $3 or more. Very few plates are $2 or less and not worth it. So unless you watch yourself it can add up quickly and be expensive.

Honestly I would recommend you go somewhere else that offers a $15 lunch or $20 dinner of all you can eat sushi. I&#39;ve been to places where the sushi is better and you can get a lot more for the price. 

This place is good if you plan not to eat a lot and you prefer to just taste-test different varieties. You may even find a few specials you can&#39;t find elsewhere. 

So in conclusion come here if you aren&#39;t really hungry and/or are new to sushi. Otherwise you might find better value at another location."

The only reason I&#39;m not is the staff was so unfriendly. We had to wait to be seated and were told 10 minutes. We ended up waiting about 25. Not usually a big deal but we had 2 two year olds and a 3 year old with us and they were ready to climb the walls by time we were seated. Probably more my fault than anything... Anyway... They don&#39;t really have waiters but the guy who took our drink order seemed less than pleased with our water choices and chocolate milk for the kids for whatever reason. But then it was time to eat.

The &#34;train&#34; service is such a great concept. I like it because you can try things without having to get a full roll. They have everything from soups and salads, to dessert. Obviously, sushi, sashimi, nigiri, and all of the above are there too, Rollin past your table making you eyeball more rolls as you&#39;re stuffing your face with one. It&#39;s almost anxiety driven, oh my god I&#39;m so full but look at that!!! **as I grab my 6th plate and add up my bill for the 25th time.** I love it.

Also, the food is really great. It looks great and it tastes great. The restaurant is clean and doesn&#39;t have a strong fish odor which I cannot stand in some places. Overall, I really loved this place and can&#39;t wait to go back. I ended up with 5 plates and my bill was $19.50.

Some pricing is good, some is bad.

They do have items such as green tea ice cream, but that is buried on the menu.

The staff is great but I do not like being seated right next to people when there are plenty of other open tables available. 

Some dishes just do not make sense. For example, they put deep fried shrimp in Udon noodle soup so that it becomes soggy. Why not just put the shrimp on the side?

I am also not sure when they use imitation crab and when it is real crab. If it is all imitation, they need to note that every time."

The service side was awesome! That has never been a complaint for me. The quality of the fish they use is another matter. I just stayed away from things I knew to be lackluster.

Tilapia is not sushi grade fish. It is merely a way to cut costs. I&#39;m just mad because the rainbow roll is my favorite and I get it at any sushi place I go to except here because of said tilapia.

Being a Saturday night we had a twenty minute wait for a table.

We love sushi and it&#39;s always fun to find gems like this. It&#39;s very conveniently situated just outside of Chicago in Elgin where you can take a pit stop when hungry to grab a quick sushi fix. LOVE the belt-line that the food is on so you can just grab what you want without having to wait! Of course there&#39;s a menu that you can order from as well if there&#39;s nothing on the belt-line that you want. My kids are pretty picky with their food (they&#39;re 5 and 6 year-olds) but all they could talk about is Sushi Station and have been asking to go back again soon - so that says something about a place. The service is friendly, quick and attentive! It&#39;s really easy to see what you&#39;re getting and how much it costs because it&#39;s all color coded with the pricing on the menu. For someone who are do-it-yourselfers like myself you&#39;ll love this place. Will be visiting again soon!"

I was missing out!  It&#39;s fun and a nice way to enjoy a variety without committing to a huge roll. Plus you get to see everything and view all the many options before committing to eat it.

All the items on the conveyor are clearly marked and list the ingredients as well, but the menus are also there and handy if you wear glasses or can&#39;t read the signs going by fast enough.  There are also charts at each seat indicating price levels of the different color-codes plates.  Was it the best sushi we&#39;ve ever had? No. But was it good? Absolutely! We felt everything we selected was fresh and tasted good.  They even have quite a few desserts to choose from and we enjoyed the Kushi Dango for our dessert choice (2 little skewers of mochi, 1 skewer was a green herb mochi w/red bean paste on top &amp; the other skewer was a plain mochi w/sweet soy syrup) - a bit challenging to get the sticky sweets off the skewers but quite tasty!

Our server was Chase and I would be remiss if I did not mention what an excellent job he did!  Just the right mix of friendly &amp; helpful, explaining the process since we were newbies to Sushi Station &amp; offering suggestions as we went along, asking how we liked certain items, etc. Our beverages of soda and water were regularly refilled as well.  Overall we enjoyed it and will be back to try other items.  It was $30 before tip for the 2 of us (I think we tried 6 items/plates in all, including the dessert), which is a steal considering where we normally go for sushi it would be a bill of at least $50, if not $70.  Granted, they aren&#39;t the same atmosphere or quality but Sushi Station was darned good in my book!"

I am not a sushi expert, so I will not attempt to critique the finer culinary details of the menu items themselves. that said, the menu offers a wide variety of raw and cooked choices, as well as a nice selection of appetizers to go along with the sushi. Of the latter, w have tried the Udon soup, calamari, fried mushrooms, and fried shumai (shrimp dumplings) - all were fantastic. 

The sushi can be ordered by the roll, or selected in 2 - 6 piece servings from the covered conveyor belt which passes each table; we chose to pick and choose from the rotating variety. Each type of sushi, side dish, or dessert that passes by is preceded by a sign explaining what it is for easy identification (a huge bonus for sushi newbies like me). I lost track of the numerous items we sampled, but I can say that all were fresh, well-presented, and very tasty.

The wide variety of small portions is one of my favorite features - it gives a chance to try lots of different things without committing to an entire roll (unless you choose to from the menu). The pricing structure for the belt items is quite simple as well - each plate is color-coded, and each color has a price. they count up your plates at the end (along with whatever menu items you may have ordered), and bill accordingly.

The restaurant was very clean, well-laid out, and has a contemporary and comfortable atmosphere. Service both times we went was wonderful - shout out to our latest server Sarah, who is professional, attentive, and very pleasant :)"

About a quarter mile long refrigerated conveyor belt makes its way through the entire restaurant displaying the variety of sushi.  This keeps the food nice and fresh.                 The sushi is good, not great. Items are well marked as to what they are.  They offer a large and somewhat confusing menu.   Prices are moderate to high. Friday night seems like kids night with many families showing up. It can also get noisy and you may have a wait.   Overall I like Sushi Station for a once and awhile sushi experience."

Sure there were some highlights... Like the shrimp appetizer I ordered off the menu. Or the glasses that were refilled regularly. Or that we controlled the pace of our meal. Beyond that, I was not planning my next visit here before we left.

The food is priced according to the color of each plate. And while there are many price points, trying two bites for $5 doesn&#39;t seem worth it to me. What if I don&#39;t like it? My hubby on the other hand was in heaven!  He just grabbed what he likes, stacked up his plates and made a dent in the weekly food budget. Somehow I thought this would be a reasonable meal. It wasn&#39;t. We were there at the end of lunch and right before dinner items started rolling out, so the selection wasn&#39;t great. I would probably try it one more time, but I would choose either lunch or dinner time and not roll in during the 3-4pm hours."

The presentation was nice but the rolls were mostly available with filler (imitation crab, cucumber - think grocery store). The shrimp tempura roll was the biggest disappointment as they contained little to no shrimp and actually used the tempura itself as an ingredient - it was really salty as well. The staff seemed nice and the go-around-sushi was fun to see. But meh. The only thing that was nice was I was fairly positive I would not get sick because 1.

Enjoyed the Alaska roll with wasabi and ginger, the seaweed salad and an all-vegetable roll.  The Alaska roll was tasty, but I was surprised that the avocado had time to turn brown; I often order Alaska roll and eat it the following day and the avocado&#39;s not brown.

I special-ordered salmon sashimi through a waiter.  It tasted very defrosted.  I&#39;m puzzled because I hear that all raw fish in the United States must be frozen, and yet all the sashimi I&#39;ve eaten elsewhere has always tasted remarkably good, except the sashimi at Sushi Station, which did taste like it came from a freezer. My only guess is that this sashimi spent more time frozen than the sushi in other establishments."

I may regret saying this...but I think this location is even better than my homebase SS location in Rolling Meadows. It seems newer, bigger, cleaner, tons of staff, the food seems more fresh and more roll options overall.

I have been to the OG Sushi Station legitimately over 100 times so when I was house sitting 10 minutes away from the bigger, badder location I knew I had to give it a whirl! What I&#39;ve come to know of Sushi Station is it isn&#39;t the most amazing, most fresh sushi in the world but the conveyor belt sushi concept is just so uber cool! It&#39;s a cool place to take out of towners plus they have some very unique and random rolls. On top of all that, you don&#39;t have to get a huge $15 roll but instead can get 4 pieces on a plate for $3.25 - or whatever the price may be. I really love everything about the Sushi Station concept.

I wasn&#39;t surprised when I was met with a 25 minute wait on a Friday, waiting at Sushi Station seems the norm plus the parking lot was packed! 

My personal favorite of their rolls is the Hanako Roll packed with indulgent ingredients like cream cheese, imitation crab, terikyaki sauce and spicy mayo with some hanako crumbs to boot. The rolls are huge and can&#39;t fit in my tiny mouth but man are they good! If you&#39;re into a little sizzle, go for the spicy hanako roll! It left my lips tingling on fire.

At this location, I noticed they put more tuna, salmon, etc in their straight fish rolls than the other location and the fish was more fresh. Perhaps I went on a good day but they were on fire!

Other roll recommendations are the Philly (standard classic), Gozilla Roll (deep fried cream cheese, imitation crab &amp; salmon goodness) and Spicy Phoenix Roll (spicy tuna, tempura crumbs, spicy mayo &amp; masago - another that left my mouth praying for some milk). They actually had a ton of other rolls not on their menu that were pretty darn tasty. Another interesting little bit about this location is it seemed a third of the conveyor belt was filled with desserts! I saw way more desserts here than I&#39;ve ever seen at the RM location including an oreo dream bar that called me name and I resisted. It seemed to be super popular though because on first pass, there were about 8 of the Oreo dream bars and the next time the belt rolled around, they were all gone!

Got to be honest here - I like this location better than the Rolling Meadows Sushi Station! Take this place for what it is - a fun novelty sushi spot with inventive rolls, good sushi (though not the best in your life) and good prices on all those fish blob plates you&#39;re going to be stacking up."

The prices are very affordable and the quality is great for what you pay. Choosing small quantities of sushi from a conveyer belt is a fun change of pace from a regular restaurant and great way to try lots of different things!

This place is NOT supposed to be the best fancy gourmet sushi you have ever eaten. It IS supposed to be affordable sushi in a fun, casual atmosphere. And it accomplishes that beautifully."

Overall, Sushi Station has quite a bit going for it.  Fast, tasty food, great wait staff, and a nice decor.  I have been only twice and let me say, the first time was stellar.  The second visit...not so much.  

I ordered the Cajun Roll and it says online (2pcs) $2.25 and then when the bill comes it says $4.50 (3pcs).   I bring this to the attention of my great server, Chris, and I show him the online menu to dispute the price.  He goes to his manager (some lady in black standing around) and talks to her, then comes back and says that that&#39;s for the 2 pieces, and I had 3.  I told him that&#39;s fine, and asked if they would be willing to split the difference ($1.13) and he goes back and tries to negotiate on my behalf.  The Manager tells them to tell me that I need to pay closer attention as &#34;Prices and ingredients are subject to change without prior notice.&#34;.  Needless to say, at this point, I&#39;m pretty peeved. 

While I understand the card the manager played and realize she&#39;s well within her rights to point to that line, it doesn&#39;t instill any sense of loyalty in me to come back to here.  Good customer service would dictate that you would accommodate the customer, but there was none of that from the manager.  They explained that their host/web content manager didn&#39;t update the site on a regular basis.  I told them that in the digital age, where people check an online menu before coming in, they should probably get on that.  I will not be returning for the foreseeable future until this is remedied.

I will say, one of the staff members in white pulled me aside and really apologized to me and I told him I&#39;d be writing this review.  He was super nice.  

Staff is great, management staff...not so much."

I appreciate that they are trying to be quick and affordable sushi, but on some plates the fish can barely be found! The $2 roll plates of salmon or tuna have minced fish that is barely a hint included in the roll, just tinting the rice. I was surprised that the cucumber rolls were the same price. 
The sashimi is hit or miss, sometimes being of an acceptable thickness and other times so thin it&#39;s almost transparent. 
Things here use to be so much better, it&#39;s sad to see that it&#39;s gone so downhill, pulling from the belt is fun, but I&#39;ll pass to be able to get at LEAST some semi decent sushi down the road."

Take this place for what it is - a fun novelty sushi spot with inventive rolls, good sushi (though not the best in your life) and good prices on all those fish blob plates you&#39;re going to be stacking up."

The prices are very affordable and the quality is great for what you pay. Choosing small quantities of sushi from a conveyer belt is a fun change of pace from a regular restaurant and great way to try lots of different things!

This place is NOT supposed to be the best fancy gourmet sushi you have ever eaten. It IS supposed to be affordable sushi in a fun, casual atmosphere. And it accomplishes that beautifully."

Overall, Sushi Station has quite a bit going for it.  Fast, tasty food, great wait staff, and a nice decor.  I have been only twice and let me say, the first time was stellar.  The second visit...not so much.  

I ordered the Cajun Roll and it says online (2pcs) $2.25 and then when the bill comes it says $4.50 (3pcs).   I bring this to the attention of my great server, Chris, and I show him the online menu to dispute the price.  He goes to his manager (some lady in black standing around) and talks to her, then comes back and says that that&#39;s for the 2 pieces, and I had 3.  I told him that&#39;s fine, and asked if they would be willing to split the difference ($1.13) and he goes back and tries to negotiate on my behalf.  The Manager tells them to tell me that I need to pay closer attention as &#34;Prices and ingredients are subject to change without prior notice.&#34;.  Needless to say, at this point, I&#39;m pretty peeved. 

While I understand the card the manager played and realize she&#39;s well within her rights to point to that line, it doesn&#39;t instill any sense of loyalty in me to come back to here.  Good customer service would dictate that you would accommodate the customer, but there was none of that from the manager.  They explained that their host/web content manager didn&#39;t update the site on a regular basis.  I told them that in the digital age, where people check an online menu before coming in, they should probably get on that.  I will not be returning for the foreseeable future until this is remedied.

I will say, one of the staff members in white pulled me aside and really apologized to me and I told him I&#39;d be writing this review.  He was super nice.  

Staff is great, management staff...not so much."

I appreciate that they are trying to be quick and affordable sushi, but on some plates the fish can barely be found! The $2 roll plates of salmon or tuna have minced fish that is barely a hint included in the roll, just tinting the rice. I was surprised that the cucumber rolls were the same price. 
The sashimi is hit or miss, sometimes being of an acceptable thickness and other times so thin it&#39;s almost transparent. 
Things here use to be so much better, it&#39;s sad to see that it&#39;s gone so downhill, pulling from the belt is fun, but I&#39;ll pass to be able to get at LEAST some semi decent sushi down the road."

If they put this little care into the dining side of the restaurant, how does it look in the kitchen?  The flooring is worn in multiple spots and falling apart by the bathrooms, the seats are worn and cracking, etc.

On the food side of things, the prices have stayed the same but the serving size has shrunk/slices of sushi have gotten thinner.  We used to go here frequently because it was a bit of a bargain, but now we need to get more plates to eat the same quantity of food, which negates any savings that might have been there before.  For the cost, I would rather just go to a sit-sown sushi place which has much better quality."

I loved conveyor sushi the couple of times I had it on the West coast, but only the only conveyor in Chicago are the two Sushi Station locations. I&#39;d been to the Rolling Meadows location and enjoyed it, but my girlfriend assured me the Elgin location was much better. So one Friday, rather than drive 40 minutes, we drove for an hour to get to Elgin.

Well, the location was certainly bigger. Almost three times bigger. That must be a good sign right?

Meeeehhhhhh. We got seated right away which was nice, with about 90 minutes left to go until close. Grab a couple plates off of the belt then...that was it. From our seat, we waited and waited, and for about 30 minutes at least all that went by was either dessert or nothing. What kind of experience is that?

I mean, sure, you can order off the menu, but I can do that anywhere. Desperate, I ordered some salmon nigiri. It came out practically frozen. Like, I could see ice crystals on it and it hurt to bite into. But, I was hungry, sucked it up, and finished it off.

I was disappointed. To the point where a couple weeks later I had a craving to go to the Rolling Meadows location just to make up for this visit.

It&#39;s a shame that there aren&#39;t more conveyor options in the Chicagoland area. After my visit here, my options are down to one."

The prices here are very affordable even if you max out with 20 plates....I&#39;ve seen it done by one person...so yes it is posible! The sushi is pretty tasty with a lot of speciality rolls.

I had not eaten there in so long and I thought this would be a perfect place to review. Sushi Station is one of the best, fast and easy sushi places near my hometown and I would definitely recommend it. If you are a sushi snob I would not recommend this place to you, because it is not super fancy and does not have the most expensive menu items. If you just love sushi or have never really tried it before this is a great place to start.

I think the coolest thing about this place is the revolving belt that goes throughout the entire restaurant and shows off all of the daily specials and sushi selections. You can then open it up right in front of you and grab the sushi you want! I love being able to pick and choose my own food and get it on my own time. The service is still really good, even with the self-serve rotating belt. During my last visit it was far more crowded in there than I had ever seen, and the wait-staff was still extremely pleasant and were quick with the service. When we left we were told &#34;have a nice night!&#34; five times (I counted). 

This sushi restaurant is so cool and interactive it is something that I would even recommend to people visiting around Chicago. Obviously Chicago is not known for their sushi, but this place is too affordable and different to pass up. You can also see the price of the sushi based on the color of the plate. For example, as the belt goes by and you grab a phoenix roll that is on a pink plate that will cost you a certain amount of money whereas grabbing a vegas roll on a blue plate will cost you something different, and so on. So like I said before this is a great way for people just trying sushi to start and sample some different things at a decent price and also be able to see what they are purchasing before they do. 

For the price of the sushi I believe the quality is pretty good. I have had some real expensive sushi in my life and this stuff tastes pretty much the same to me. If you think the food is not fresh that comes around the belt, they will make whatever you order as well! Sushi Station is a super cool place, it is relaxed, and it is an easy way to order sushi for those who are nervous or unsure. They make you feel at is and you really cannot beat their prices!"

I&#39;ve had worse and obviously have had much better! If you&#39;re looking for an okay, surveyor belt type of sushi place, but prices don&#39;t really make up for it.

I also had the fire crunch roll made to order but the rolls on the conveyor belt are equally as delicious to grab. (I grabbed the tuna nigiri which was fabulous and a California roll from the belt).

The flooring is worn in multiple spots and falling apart by the bathrooms, the seats are worn and cracking, etc.

On the food side of things, the prices have stayed the same but the serving size has shrunk/slices of sushi have gotten thinner.  We used to go here frequently because it was a bit of a bargain, but now we need to get more plates to eat the same quantity of food, which negates any savings that might have been there before.  For the cost, I would rather just go to a sit-sown sushi place which has much better quality."

I loved conveyor sushi the couple of times I had it on the West coast, but only the only conveyor in Chicago are the two Sushi Station locations. I&#39;d been to the Rolling Meadows location and enjoyed it, but my girlfriend assured me the Elgin location was much better. So one Friday, rather than drive 40 minutes, we drove for an hour to get to Elgin.

Well, the location was certainly bigger. Almost three times bigger. That must be a good sign right?

Meeeehhhhhh. We got seated right away which was nice, with about 90 minutes left to go until close. Grab a couple plates off of the belt then...that was it. From our seat, we waited and waited, and for about 30 minutes at least all that went by was either dessert or nothing. What kind of experience is that?

I mean, sure, you can order off the menu, but I can do that anywhere. Desperate, I ordered some salmon nigiri. It came out practically frozen. Like, I could see ice crystals on it and it hurt to bite into. But, I was hungry, sucked it up, and finished it off.

I was disappointed. To the point where a couple weeks later I had a craving to go to the Rolling Meadows location just to make up for this visit.

It&#39;s a shame that there aren&#39;t more conveyor options in the Chicagoland area. After my visit here, my options are down to one."

The food was pretty good and the verity was great. The only thing I was disappointed with is that I order the Dragon Roll off of the menu but before I did I asked was it served hot. I was told yes. When I received the Dragon Roll it was cold. I also don&#39;t think it was worth over $16.

However, it is pretty damn tasty. I&#39;ve been coming to this location since they opened. It is much bigger, brighter, cleaner and nicer staff than the original location. Sorry...but it is true. 

The nice thing about this place is that you need to wait. You can grab a table pretty quickly and well grab your meal. The prices here are very affordable even if you max out with 20 plates....I&#39;ve seen it done by one person...so yes it is posible! The sushi is pretty tasty with a lot of speciality rolls. My favorite item here isn&#39;t actually sushi, but their freaking cream puffs! Yes, cream puffs! They are like little pillows in your mouth. I hate sweets and pastries. However, nothing gets between me and cream puffs.  

Overall, great dining experience and pretty kid friendly. Even non-sushi eaters there are alot of other options too!"

Manager is not so friendly and not willing to make things better for customer. Would have been a better experience if he would gas offer some kind of compensation. I&#39;ve ordered extra food to go and left it behind. Forgot to pick it up. Called them and they said they would hold it for me. I forgot till 2 days later to pick up. They threw away my food! I wanted them to work something out. Nope! The manager refused to do anything except telling me that he already did me a favor by holding on to my food for few days!!! Wow... Extremely disappointed with the manager and how he doesn&#39;t do something to make his customers happier. I didn&#39;t ask for free food! A small discount would have been a better solution.  Hopefully it will be a better service with others. DISAPPOINTMENT

I had not eaten there in so long and I thought this would be a perfect place to review. Sushi Station is one of the best, fast and easy sushi places near my hometown and I would definitely recommend it. If you are a sushi snob I would not recommend this place to you, because it is not super fancy and does not have the most expensive menu items. If you just love sushi or have never really tried it before this is a great place to start.

I think the coolest thing about this place is the revolving belt that goes throughout the entire restaurant and shows off all of the daily specials and sushi selections. You can then open it up right in front of you and grab the sushi you want! I love being able to pick and choose my own food and get it on my own time. The service is still really good, even with the self-serve rotating belt. During my last visit it was far more crowded in there than I had ever seen, and the wait-staff was still extremely pleasant and were quick with the service. When we left we were told &#34;have a nice night!&#34; five times (I counted). 

This sushi restaurant is so cool and interactive it is something that I would even recommend to people visiting around Chicago. Obviously Chicago is not known for their sushi, but this place is too affordable and different to pass up. You can also see the price of the sushi based on the color of the plate. For example, as the belt goes by and you grab a phoenix roll that is on a pink plate that will cost you a certain amount of money whereas grabbing a vegas roll on a blue plate will cost you something different, and so on. So like I said before this is a great way for people just trying sushi to start and sample some different things at a decent price and also be able to see what they are purchasing before they do. 

For the price of the sushi I believe the quality is pretty good. I have had some real expensive sushi in my life and this stuff tastes pretty much the same to me. If you think the food is not fresh that comes around the belt, they will make whatever you order as well! Sushi Station is a super cool place, it is relaxed, and it is an easy way to order sushi for those who are nervous or unsure. They make you feel at is and you really cannot beat their prices!"

This is tough because if you go to a surveyor belt type of sushi place, I believe you probably already know you&#39;re not getting the best sushi in town. Two of the four plates did not seem fresh and the other two were just okay. 

I&#39;ve had worse and obviously have had much better! If you&#39;re looking for an okay, surveyor belt type of sushi place, but prices don&#39;t really make up for it.

The positive is that kids do love looking and picking their meals and it&#39;s a form of entertainment."

I can say with certainty I enjoyed some of the rolls &amp; I didn&#39;t expect too. The Paradise knocked my socks off actually.

I was visiting family in Illinois as I myself am from New Jersey and my cousin told me I had to try their local sushi place. As soon as I walked in and saw the revolving conveyor system of sushi, I was amazed. I&#39;ve never seen that back home or anywhere before. The flavor of the sushi was absolutely delicious. The edamame when made to order was to die for as it is roasted in garlic and soy sauce and was delicious. I also had the fire crunch roll made to order but the rolls on the conveyor belt are equally as delicious to grab. (I grabbed the tuna nigiri which was fabulous and a California roll from the belt). Our waiter was super friendly and accommodating and overall I loved my sushi station experience. I definitely added this restaurant to my list of places to go the next time I am here visiting family. HIGHLY recommended if you are a sushi lover."

My colleague and I had been to Jurin before (another conveyer sushi belt place) and were led to believe Elgin did not have great sushi. We decided to give Elgin sushi another go and were going to drive 40 min roundtrip to a real sushi restaurant. However, we passed by this Sushi Station and saw it looked really nice on the outside and since we were short on time, we decided to give Elgin conveyer belt sushi another try. 

The experience was terrible! The sushi was just as bad as Jurin. Everything was really chewy and squishy. =( The gyozas were the only edible things. The employees were really nice though... but we are both done with conveyer belt sushi forever..."

Well we got to the Elgin location and the staff were all standing around laughing &amp; joking which at first I thought was fine until I realized they were laughing at some customers. That was put off #1, then we were seated, now we are at put off #2, the counter was dirty &amp; sticky so I asked if we could move to a table, the young man said sure &amp; showed us to a table that was also dirty &amp; sticky, so that was put off #3, the floor was covered in food that was wiped off the tables so that was put off #4, then finally after finding a clean place to sit I was excited to show my partner the different foods that come around on the conveyer belt only to have to sit there &amp; wait 15 minutes for anything to appear, now mind you our visit was on a Sunday but still I expected the conveyor belt to have food circling around but seriously it was a 10 minute wait in between each item. We ended up paying for our soda and left and drove out to the Rolling Meadows location where the staff is much more friendly, the store is clean, the food is fantastic and they care about you at the Rolling Meadows location.

I did think it was interesting how they kind of adapted to their audience in Elgin and served rolls made with things other than raw fish.  Smart management.  We have loved this place (beginning in Schaumburg) for well over 10 years.  We were happy to see another location (when we lived out that way). 

Recommended, especially if it&#39;s your first time.  You aren&#39;t locked in to anything -- just snatch a plate from the conveyor belt and viola, you spent $3 or whatever.  Don&#39;t like it?  No big deal.  And you can always order if you are a more advanced diner.  I can&#39;t wait to go back!"

Is this the best sushi in the area? No, but if you&#39;re looking for GOOD quality, creativity, and selection... and GREAT ambience, service, and value... you&#39;re at the right place. This is why you&#39;re reading mixed reviews.

I come here when I want sushi quick and easy, and I want to enjoy a social time with my friends and family.

If you&#39;re apprehensive about the conveyor style, don&#39;t be, because the tunnel is refrigerated! And if you&#39;re so inclined, you can request anything made to order.

I recommend this place for casual to new sushi fans who want to try a bunch of different rolls for a decent price. Great for kids and groups.

As far as stars, here&#39;s my reason for 4 :
Quality/Freshness : 4
Creativity : 4
Selection : 3
Ambience : 5 (super social, high energy)
Service : 5 (attentive and polite)
Value : 4 (you control the value!)

So Sushi Station gets 4 stars for the overall experience, start to finish!

It is sad because it was good cheap sushi.  Now the avocado is dark green and starting to turn black.

Basically the good quality is inconstant.

I pointed out that it was only 8:10 and they didn&#39;t close until 9.  Basically, he said sorry.  Seriously, they don&#39;t make sushi for the hour before they close.  What&#39;s the point of that?  At the least he could have asked what types we would like and have had those made.  Last time I&#39;m going there."

Well we got to the Elgin location and the staff were all standing around laughing &amp; joking which at first I thought was fine until I realized they were laughing at some customers. That was put off #1, then we were seated, now we are at put off #2, the counter was dirty &amp; sticky so I asked if we could move to a table, the young man said sure &amp; showed us to a table that was also dirty &amp; sticky, so that was put off #3, the floor was covered in food that was wiped off the tables so that was put off #4, then finally after finding a clean place to sit I was excited to show my partner the different foods that come around on the conveyer belt only to have to sit there &amp; wait 15 minutes for anything to appear, now mind you our visit was on a Sunday but still I expected the conveyor belt to have food circling around but seriously it was a 10 minute wait in between each item. We ended up paying for our soda and left and drove out to the Rolling Meadows location where the staff is much more friendly, the store is clean, the food is fantastic and they care about you at the Rolling Meadows location.  Very sad that the staff at the Elgin location thinks it&#39;s fun to make fun of customers."

We haven&#39;t been disappointed by a trip to Sushi Station (only because of a wait) in either Schaumburg or Elgin.  I did think it was interesting how they kind of adapted to their audience in Elgin and served rolls made with things other than raw fish.  Smart management.  We have loved this place (beginning in Schaumburg) for well over 10 years.  We were happy to see another location (when we lived out that way). 

Recommended, especially if it&#39;s your first time.  You aren&#39;t locked in to anything -- just snatch a plate from the conveyor belt and viola, you spent $3 or whatever.  Don&#39;t like it?  No big deal.  And you can always order if you are a more advanced diner.  I can&#39;t wait to go back!"

Is this the best sushi in the area? No, but if you&#39;re looking for GOOD quality, creativity, and selection... and GREAT ambience, service, and value... you&#39;re at the right place. This is why you&#39;re reading mixed reviews.

I come here when I want sushi quick and easy, and I want to enjoy a social time with my friends and family.

If you&#39;re apprehensive about the conveyor style, don&#39;t be, because the tunnel is refrigerated! And if you&#39;re so inclined, you can request anything made to order.

I recommend this place for casual to new sushi fans who want to try a bunch of different rolls for a decent price. Great for kids and groups.

As far as stars, here&#39;s my reason for 4 :
Quality/Freshness : 4
Creativity : 4
Selection : 3
Ambience : 5 (super social, high energy)
Service : 5 (attentive and polite)
Value : 4 (you control the value!)

So Sushi Station gets 4 stars for the overall experience, start to finish!

My pick : Spicy Scallop Gunkan (usually something you have to order on the menu)"

We have been coming here for years and over they last year the quality has decreased.  I am not just taking about the food... I am taking about how clean it is. The chairs are all ripping, plates come out dirty, hair on the packages of wasabi and dirty tray coverings. 

It is sad because it was good cheap sushi.  Now the avocado is dark green and starting to turn black.

Basically the good quality is inconstant.  

Note this is not the first time we have had issues. I told managed all of our last three times (we have eaten here literally 30+ times, yes we were big fans).  Managers don&#39;t seem to care.

As for the sushi, it&#39;s decent. They are definitely reducing the amount of crab/shrimp/etc in the sushi. When you have to search for the crab in a roll, that&#39;s unacceptable.

Ya know that saying, &#34;my eyes are bigger than my stomach?&#34; Well, be prepared. There&#39;s like an 85.4% chance that you&#39;ll be saying it when you visit Sushi Station. For me, totes mcgoats, 100%. haha.  But, I never waste sushi (and neither should you). So, here&#39;s my tip if you order or grab a few plates more than you should have:

1) Take a breather.
2) Watch the parade of sushi go around the conveyor belt a couple times and
3) Continue on your delicious endeavor!

Overall, Sushi Station has classic sushi options and some fun rolls thrown in on their mile long belt and it&#39;s menu. I think the price is fair and the quality of sushi is pretty good. I would have tried a dessert- lots of choices as well- but I got too full on sushi. :("

It&#39;s average, at best, probably a little below average if we&#39;re being honest, but who doesn&#39;t love the conveyor belt of sushi plates that show up right in front of you while you eat? I&#39;m not one to be overly critical of sushi station--if I want high quality sushi, I&#39;ll go to a real sushi restaurant and pay double the price. Having said all of this, I have found that over the years, the quality has significantly decreased while the prices have gone up. There used to be a sea of &#34;pink&#34; plates gliding past you; now, you&#39;re lucky to see a single pink plate in a sitting (nearly everything is blue or green). Even with the increase prices, I&#39;ve still been willing to go back from time to time because I&#39;m a sucker for a gimmick, and while the west coast may have these types of restaurants all over the place, it&#39;s unique here in the Chicagoland suburbs. 

So why the two stars? Well, after going for lunch last week, I finally had it with this place. My husband and I got there over an hour before the end of the lunch hours. The place was still packed with people, but they weren&#39;t putting any new plates on the conveyor belt. It seemed like the kitchen was on a mission to force the reject plates on those of us patiently sitting there, waiting for a spicy tuna or shrimp tempura roll to pass, but instead seeing the same lousy egg nigiri and disgusting desserts (is anyone actually taking one of those coffee jelly&#39;s off the belt?). I sat and watched everyone sadly watch as the same plates circled around over and over again. For a split second, I thought about ordering a roll from my server, but then I was like...nahh, I don&#39;t want to give this place another cent. If this is how they want to run lunch, count me out.

Here&#39;s the thing sushi station...I can accept you feeding me subpar rolls with fish that probably contains deathly amounts of mercury. But what I canNOT accept is you denying me my inalienable right to ingest your toxic tuna. Get it together, Sushi Station."

My brother in law took me after the Sox so I could try sushi for the first time. First thing I liked was the employees greeting all the customers by saying &#34;welcome&#34; in Japanese. Next was the nice waiting staff. They helped us out fast. Since it was my first time there, I had to look at the menu carefully to know what was being served. My brother didn&#39;t miss a beat when he started telling me which rolls were the best. He proceeded by ordering a bunch of different rolls for me to try. Only thing I ordered on my own was a regular tuna roll. Each roll I tried were amazing. Never once did I think I could like sushi. The third thing I liked about the restaurant was the moving conveyor table, showing all different dishes as they pass by and that people can just open the the little doors and grab a plate or two. Plus, how each plate had different colors, meaning different prices. Before the night was over, my brother insisted that if try some wasabi. Big mistake, but worth trying. I know my favorite roll is the Godzilla. Such a nice name for a delicious roll. I know I will be going back sometime soon. Maybe for the lunch specials. This is a decent place that I would recommend for people to try sushi for the first time. Domo arrigato."

As for the sushi, it&#39;s decent. They are definitely reducing the amount of crab/shrimp/etc in the sushi. When you have to search for the crab in a roll, that&#39;s unacceptable. 

Dont lose more business sushi station. Make the rolls the way they&#39;re supposed to be made."

Ya know that saying, &#34;my eyes are bigger than my stomach?&#34; Well, be prepared. There&#39;s like an 85.4% chance that you&#39;ll be saying it when you visit Sushi Station. For me, totes mcgoats, 100%. haha.  But, I never waste sushi (and neither should you). So, here&#39;s my tip if you order or grab a few plates more than you should have:

1) Take a breather.
2) Watch the parade of sushi go around the conveyor belt a couple times and
3) Continue on your delicious endeavor!

Overall, Sushi Station has classic sushi options and some fun rolls thrown in on their mile long belt and it&#39;s menu. I think the price is fair and the quality of sushi is pretty good. I would have tried a dessert- lots of choices as well- but I got too full on sushi. :("

It&#39;s average, at best, probably a little below average if we&#39;re being honest, but who doesn&#39;t love the conveyor belt of sushi plates that show up right in front of you while you eat? I&#39;m not one to be overly critical of sushi station--if I want high quality sushi, I&#39;ll go to a real sushi restaurant and pay double the price. Having said all of this, I have found that over the years, the quality has significantly decreased while the prices have gone up. There used to be a sea of &#34;pink&#34; plates gliding past you; now, you&#39;re lucky to see a single pink plate in a sitting (nearly everything is blue or green). Even with the increase prices, I&#39;ve still been willing to go back from time to time because I&#39;m a sucker for a gimmick, and while the west coast may have these types of restaurants all over the place, it&#39;s unique here in the Chicagoland suburbs. 

So why the two stars? Well, after going for lunch last week, I finally had it with this place. My husband and I got there over an hour before the end of the lunch hours. The place was still packed with people, but they weren&#39;t putting any new plates on the conveyor belt. It seemed like the kitchen was on a mission to force the reject plates on those of us patiently sitting there, waiting for a spicy tuna or shrimp tempura roll to pass, but instead seeing the same lousy egg nigiri and disgusting desserts (is anyone actually taking one of those coffee jelly&#39;s off the belt?). I sat and watched everyone sadly watch as the same plates circled around over and over again. For a split second, I thought about ordering a roll from my server, but then I was like...nahh, I don&#39;t want to give this place another cent. If this is how they want to run lunch, count me out.

Here&#39;s the thing sushi station...I can accept you feeding me subpar rolls with fish that probably contains deathly amounts of mercury. But what I canNOT accept is you denying me my inalienable right to ingest your toxic tuna. Get it together, Sushi Station."

My brother in law took me after the Sox so I could try sushi for the first time. First thing I liked was the employees greeting all the customers by saying &#34;welcome&#34; in Japanese. Next was the nice waiting staff. They helped us out fast. Since it was my first time there, I had to look at the menu carefully to know what was being served. My brother didn&#39;t miss a beat when he started telling me which rolls were the best. He proceeded by ordering a bunch of different rolls for me to try. Only thing I ordered on my own was a regular tuna roll. Each roll I tried were amazing. Never once did I think I could like sushi. The third thing I liked about the restaurant was the moving conveyor table, showing all different dishes as they pass by and that people can just open the the little doors and grab a plate or two. Plus, how each plate had different colors, meaning different prices. Before the night was over, my brother insisted that if try some wasabi. Big mistake, but worth trying. I know my favorite roll is the Godzilla. Such a nice name for a delicious roll. I know I will be going back sometime soon. Maybe for the lunch specials. This is a decent place that I would recommend for people to try sushi for the first time. Domo arrigato."

I have been brave and tried a couple of different sushi rolls -- but it&#39;s just not my type of thing.

My husband and kids however, could devour plates upon plates of the rolls. My daughter absolutely loves the cucumber rolls and my son is a huge station roll fan.

My go-to when we dine here is the teriyaki chicken and a bowl of steamed rice. It&#39;s good enough that I allow my family to keep dragging me back to a place that serves 90% sushi."

They are definitely more on the affordable side so I by no means have expectations for some super high quality, fancy sushi, but I do expect it to taste fresh and not be warm like it has the last few times. 

I&#39;m also much more hesitant to order from Sushi Station because an experience I had a few months ago that left a bad taste in my mouth. I called at about 7 or 8pm on a week night and placed an order for pick up while I was on my way home from a friend&#39;s in Palatine. I live in Hampshire so Sushi Station is conveniently right on my way home. After I got off the phone I realized that I had left my debit card at home and didn&#39;t have another way to pay. As it was late and I was still pretty far from home, I wouldn&#39;t have enough time to get my card and pick up my order before they closed so I called back to cancel my order. I called literally within 5 minutes of placing my order and started off by saying how sorry I was and explained that why I had to cancel my order. The girl that I was speaking with became extremely rude asking me a bunch of questions after I had already explained why I needed to cancel my order. She then said in a very snotty matter that she would tell the chef and hung up on me. 

I understand that the situation is not good for them and they didn&#39;t want to waste food, which is why I apologized and made sure to call WITHIN 5 MINUTES. I did not appreciate the tone that was used or being hung up on. In the service industry it is important to be kind to customers regardless of the situation. 

Sushi Station used to have my business at least 3 times a month. Now due to a VERY poor customer service experience and the quality of their food declining I&#39;m not sure if I will be back."

I like how big this sushi station is compared to the other but I felt that the variety was lacking. With a bigger restaurant, you have a bigger conveyer belt and food that just sits for longer periods of time vs the smaller sushi station. I just ordered off the menu instead of picking up items because some items you could tell were there from the beginning of the morning.

However, the one disadvantage this location has is the underwhelming service staff - save for a small handful of them. Seems like more often than not, I&#39;m always looking around for my server to get a drink refill. Even on a recent visit they have a &#34;beverage bar&#34; set up in the middle of one of the belt loops and WE STILL WAITED for drink refills. Would&#39;ve been easier for me to ask the staff running this beverage bar myself instead of waiting around for our server to get them.

I&#39;d heard it was bigger. It is. The building is absolutely gorgeous. I was really excited when I first walked in, because it seemed like there was a lot more breathing room in this location than in the Rolling Meadows one.

There aren&#39;t a lot of options for kaitenzushi (pay-by-the-plate sushi, on conveyor belts) around, so Sushi Station stands apart in that regard. And it&#39;s a lot of fun -- especially if you take someone who has never experienced it before.

But the food? The food at Elgin isn&#39;t as good. At least, not as good as I remember. I haven&#39;t been to the one in Rolling Meadows in probably 6 months, at least -- so maybe it&#39;s gone downhill, as well. 

The food looks nice (although again -- presentation was better at Rolling Meadows) -- but it seemed kind of warm (definitely not good for sushi, and there WAS quick turnover because we went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was hopping), and it seems like the prices have gone up. More stuff is on the pricier plates now than before. I used to be able to eat about $10-$12 worth of sushi at Sushi Station and be perfectly happy. 

Between two of us, we spent almost $60 for a meh meal that made our stomachs feel unpleasantly gurgly a short time later. 

I&#39;ll give the Rolling Meadows location another chance, just to be able to compare. But I doubt I&#39;ll go back to the Elgin one. Not worth it."

Sushi Station has a strict no outside food policy, while they admit to letting the occasional baby food or toddler cereal in, they may not, and in my opinion that is not worth the hassle of unbuckling and dragging your baby/toddler into the restaurant.

We learned the hard way.  This used to be one of our favorite places which we frequented at least twice a month.  One cold evening we came in to relax after a long week and were harassed at the door by the hostess who wouldn&#39;t let us pass with my not yet two year old son&#39;s lunch cooler bag.  She demanded to inspect the contents like we were going through airport security and we had to wait for her to get management approval for us to be seated.  My son has multiple severe food allergies which include all grains (rice, oats, wheat, etc), egg, corn, soy, and potato.  The cooler had his &#34;safe food&#34; from home.  Well I immediately lost my appetite, it&#39;s hard enough finding safe food for my son to eat and then being harassed about it!   I thought surely this was just a hostess on some sort of power trip and contacted the restaurant.  To my dismay they are standing firm with their policy for fear I will poison my son with his safe food from home and hold their insurance accountable!!!  And yet they couldn&#39;t name one food they could prepare for him to eat, but they hope we&#39;ll dine again soon!  I guess my son could just watch us eat, seriously?

I love sushi and maki rolls and had seen the sushi station commercials on tv so I really wanted to try to it.

So we went Saturday night, Me, my son, and my girlfriend and her kids.  My son and i love sushi, the others don&#39;t like it at all.

The wait staff was super friendly and happy.  The atmosphere is modern and cool.  The way the wood comes around is a trip.  And over all the sushi was fresh and tasted really good.

I will say, I over spent and over ate for sure.  I usually never get that full on maki rolls but I left there stuffed.  The good deserts didn&#39;t help any I&#39;m sure!  

I think the sushi station is a great place for a beginner sushi eater because you don&#39;t have to order, you just pick your dish up as it goes by.

First off, I&#39;ve never had to wait for seating at the Elgin location since the place is so huge. It&#39;s at least twice if not three times larger than the Rolling Meadows location. The decor is contemporary and clean, and the space has high ceilings and is very airy. 

Like many of the other Yelps said, Sushi Station is a great place for novice sushi eaters. Each plate comes with four pieces of sushi, so it&#39;s not a huge commitment. You can also order hot appetizers from the menu, as well as rolls that you don&#39;t see on the conveyor belt. 

For appetizers, I love their seaweed salad, miso soup, dumplings and fried shumai. The tempura and shrimp crispers are also really tasty. As far as rolls go, I love the Philly rolls. The rock &#39;n roll and spider roll are also good. 

Service at Sushi Station is solid. They clear away excess plates, napkins and lids. Very friendly.

I love Sushi Station, and this Elgin location is the tops. Check it out!"

Time of my visit: Lunch

It has been awhile, since I&#39;ve to an Indian joint.  I  have decided, I would like to do a lunch buffet.

Let&#39;s start with the price.  It was $9.99 per person, which I think, was a bit much...  Even for that area.

The buffet was an L-shape in a corner of the restaurant.  They had a nice salad, which had iceberg letters, cucumbers and tomatoes, which is a lot more than you&#39;d normally get somewhere else.  I have also tried rice, curry chicken, noodles chicken (I am so sorry, I know I am butchering it) chicken in tomato soup.  It was all decent.

The best part was the chicken the waitress brought out from the kitchen.  I always enjoyed watching and hearing it sizzle!  That chicken was delicious!  And pitas that came with it was good too.

There were two main concerns that I had, one the poor waitress was overwhelmed!  There was a big lunch rush and she was the only one there.  She hustled well!  Another issue was an &#34;inspector&#34; came in to the facility.  I am gonna go ahead and assume it was a health department inspector or a city inspector, which immediately put me at a bit tense state.

I would say about B-.  Wouldn&#39;t mind coming back and maybe ordering something off the menu."

I&#39;ve been to this location when it was originally Himalaya, and I can say that Taj Mahal is probably one of my favorite Indian buffets. 

Service was fast, but not extremely attentive. Personally, I come for the food, not the service (if that bothers you, sorry, but most Asian restaurants aren&#39;t the best when it comes to service). Food was still hot and a generous batch of Naan freshly made was also served. I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember a lot of the dishes, but some that stuck out was a goat curry, chicken 95, and some paneer dish. I found the dishes to be spicier and also a tad sweeter than other places I&#39;ve tried (both good things in my opinion). Their gulab jamun is the perfect amount of sweetness, and their mango ice cream was a delight. 

Overall, I found this restaurant to be a gem in the plethora of Indian buffets prominent in the Chicagoland suburbs. Definitely recommend it."

Few general things that I don&#39;t really like which are reasons for the 3 star rating:
- private event area is open so the rest of the restaurant is really loud when they are hosting an event
- I think some of the food they serve is just reheated leftovers from their lunch buffet (specifically the biryani)
- I prefer when leftover food is packed in front of me instead of in the kitchen
- Took our water glasses before we finished paying (felt like they were trying to rush us out)
- Took a really long time to process my payment. They said the credit card machine so I gave cash and then they said their register drawer wasn&#39;t opening

Food wasn&#39;t horrible, but relatively very disappointed compared to the old Taj"

I had a chance to come back here during my Christmas break and had the lunch buffet. The food is still very fresh and tasty however one big issue I have is with the cold dinner plates. I don&#39;t know why the plates were ice cold however it made the rest of food including the curry become very cold as soon as it hit the plate. I believe that the services actually improved as the waiters were even friendlier and you can easily get naan and the tandori chicken.

It had always been my favorite Indian food in the Chicago burbs. Their palak paneer is uniquely delicious. Really though, I love everything they serve, from the flavorful curries to the mango kulfi.

I&#39;ve been here several times for their $9 lunch buffet. My fave thing is getting the buffet to go so I don&#39;t get tempted to gorge myself to death. It&#39;s the same price, and you get to fill up one big styrofoam container plus two cups for curry. Tandoori chicken and naan are included as well. The whole thing lasts me for days.

Service was polite and attentive. The place is clean and nice. I wish I could eat here every week."

They didn&#39;t say hi just asked how many when we walked in.  They led us to a tiny two seat table which is fine but almost all the other tables were empty 4 top. Would&#39;ve been much more comfortable at a bigger table.  The person who sat us asked me to write a review when we leave. Be careful what you ask for..  

The food: Stay away from the chicken samosas. They are filled with pieces of tough chicken kind of like chewing jewels, but not like they describe. We had the tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala with naan ,  rice, and gulab jamun. My son loved it but he doesn&#39;t know how the food use to be when they were on Lake Street.  I miss them being there.

Over all not worth the 60 bucks for the food but my son liked it so they get 1 star.  It is not a kids sort of place,  mine just happens to like to be in a restaurant in general."

This is my favorite restaurant ever but today probably our 60th order in two years we ordered food my wife called and said the bharta was bad ( smelled like rotten tomatoes) so the person we spoke to said well if you think it&#39;s bad come here and show me 

She drove the 20 minutes there then they offered a replacement. Without a refund mind you And while we waited I ordered a beer and had the audacity to charge me for a beer 

Sometimes mistakes happen but to first blame my wife for not knowing her food the to blame the junior chef since he is learning and not offer a full refund is ridiculous 

The previous chef God rest his sole knew how to handle customers we were there over 30 minutes and the manager didn&#39;t even have the courtesy to come see us after 5 requests

Ugh, I&#39;ll give them 2 stars because they are still new but we had a terrible experience here. The service was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too slow :( We were a group of two pregnant women with toddlers and hubbies and they stuck us in a tiny cramped table in the corner. They basically ignored us and we had to ask for they waiter to come take our order twice before someone finally came. The food was okay, so I will cut them some slack and go back for a second round one day. Love Indian food so I&#39;m hoping for a better experience next time around.

***** update*****
Just had dinner here tonight and enjoyed the dining experience I was originally hoping for from this place! I enjoyed the chicken biryani, butter chicken, and raita with a pakora entree. Delicious! Mango shake to wash it down and help numb the spice. The service was on key. Waitress checked on us multiple times, and water was refilled consistently. They actually had a straw cup with lid for kids this time. (They didn&#39;t have it last time) they did forget the talhi dish at first but our waitress realized it before we had to mention anything.

You&#39;ll be seated to white butcher paper covered tables and water poured to your glass. While selecting food at the buffet, the tandoori chicken and naan bread is brought to your table.

Lunch buffet is a great deal if you are unfamiliar and want to sample different dishes because they give you so many to choose from. I managed to try only about 80% of what they offered in the menu as listed below...

chicken tandoori
naan bread
veggie spring roll
veggie hakka noodles
paneer makhani
saag corn
chilli chicken
tawa vegetables
goat meat
chicken makhani
chana masala
dal makhani
veggie samosa
mango ice cream

Notables: the tandoori chicken came out sizzling hot, naan was fresh and warm, the tawa vegetables was bland and did not look appetizing sitting on a flat tray, the hakka noodles tasted good, but noodles were overcooked, and the samosa was very spicy (not meant in a bad way). My favorite dish was the goat meat. The sauce was very savory and flavorful. In summary, the food was pretty good. Spice level was set low to medium so it should be comfortable to most people.

Service was attentive. They took away any empty dishes and will ask for any refills as they pass by. Tables were bused and kept cleaned. The buffet was in the corner as if it was part of the kitchen and was not furnished. I think the ambience and decor of the dining area needs to be extended here. It just seemed odd.

I have been here before when it was a Chinese restaurant. And then again as the Himalayan restaurant. The casual atmosphere and basic layout hasn&#39;t changed. There&#39;s a semi-private area for parties and the bar is near the front, though I wondered why there were no seats there. There was a couple monitors. The one facing the bar had sports while the other had an Indian news channel. Most of the patrons seemed of South Asian descent and spoke their native language. I would say it adds legitimacy as an authentic Indian restaurant. The restaurant used to be on Lake Street in Bloomingdale before moving here about a year ago."

I like that they&#39;re open semi-late (later than Ashoka which sometimes won&#39;t even take your call at 30 mins to closing). 
I ordered the paneer makhani. The menu says &#34;Ala Carte is served with naan&#34; and I ordered one additional naan so I expected the curry and 2 naan but what I received was the paneer makhani, rice, and one naan. They asked how spicy I wanted it and I told them very spicy - they delivered on the spiciness but there is some sacrifice on flavor when they make it that hot. Additionally, I detected a slight burnt flavor and the curry appeared burnt as well - not enough to become inedible - but it could have been better.

All in all, not that bad. I think the Glendale Heights/Bloomingdale area is lacking a really stellar Indian place (surprising given the demographic around here) if Taj Mahal works on a few things they might be able to step up and fill that void."

At least now I know what to put on and what to leave off my plate. 

I experienced an equal mix of good and bad. The vegetable pakora were decent enough but the vegetable spring rolls had no flavor and were so under-fried that they flashed a ghostly white. I really enjoyed the aloo gobhi (cauliflower and potatoes) but was so disappointed in the bland, watery chana masala. Redemption showed promise in the form of tender, juicy, tasty chicken tikka masala, but then the tandoori chicken, which was served at the table on its own little sizzling platter, fell flat, suffering from inexplicably dry thigh meat. I finished the entire basket of hot, crispy-fluffy naan, but then my initial excitement at the sight of dal-stuffed dosa with sambar deflated once I took a bite of the rubbery crêpe dipped into an insipid soup. 

Dinner takeout another night further let me down - yellow dal completely lacked flavor and the &#34;seasonal&#34; fish curry clearly used frozen fish (no real surprise in the suburbs, I suppose), even though I did like the tomatoey gravy with bits of coconut. 

Indian food should be perfumed with spice and envelop your palate with an array of exotic, complex flavors, and Taj Mahal failed to deliver. 

However, they do offer delivery through a third-party service called Takeout Runners."

In fact, this time there were some new faces as well.  Overall, the service was way better and on the spot.  The food was delicious.
We got medium spiciness and it was medium. Sometimes medium is like super hot. 
Lamb pasanda is a dish I&#39;d recommend.
Yum.

Turns out that if you order chicken biryani for dine-in it comes  with raita on the side (typical) but if you order the chicken biryani carryout, it doesn&#39;t come with raita and you have to pay $4 extra.  Ridiculous."

The food took a long time to come out. The bathrooms are not so friendly. I had my doubts. But as soon as the food came out and we took our first bite we were blown away at how great it tasted. I would definitely recommend just from the simple Taste of the food. We asked for the food to be cooked medium spicy and it was just right!

We&#39;ve gotten the Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Vindaloo, Rogan Josh, Dal Makhani, some kind of Paneer (not for me though...I&#39;m not a fan of anything paneer), and the Naan (both the regular and the garlic version...yum).  It&#39;s a little pricey (everything is a la carte...rice and naan too) but it is all REALLY GOOD.  The Tikka Masala here has the perfect amount of curry, tomato, cream, and spice and the chicken is usually pretty tender.  The Vindaloo is SPICY AS HELL and set my mouth on fire (despite my love for spicy foods AND the fact that I ordered it medium spicy...I&#39;d hate to see what hot is like!) but it was also really good.  The Vindaloo has really tender potatoes and a great sauce too.  All that other crazy stuff is for my man&#39;s dinner but he hasn&#39;t had a complaint yet so I&#39;m guessing they are all pretty solid.  They also pack you a healthy pouch of onions, lemons, and maybe some greens, but I don&#39;t touch those either so they kind of go to waste...just thought you should know that IS included with your meal if you order out.  

This is my go-to Indian place close to home so I&#39;m glad they&#39;re back.  DON&#39;T LEAVE ME AGAIN, TAJ MAHAL."

Was there with my wife and 6 month old infant. They were nice enough to let us choose a seat since we had a stroller. Unfortunately the service was terrible. We were there for 10 minutes before anyone came to us. And there were a lot of empty tables so it wasn&#39;t due to it being crowded. Finally the waitress comes to us and we ask her for water. Nobody even gave us water when we sat down. Then we asked her how many samosas come in the appetizer. She didn&#39;t know and has to leave and ask someone else. We ordered our food and appetizer and noticed everyone had papad at their tables except for us. After awhile we finally flagged someone down and asked for it. They apologized and gave us our papad. The service was extremely slow. The servers were very apologetic so at least they had that. At the end of the day we were there for 2.5 hours which is way too much especially with an infant that started getting fussy around the two hour mark.  The food was actually very good taste wise. And we were given a discount for the long wait. Unfortunately we were not able to enjoy the food the way we wanted because the baby was fussing. And frankly.....We were irritated too.  As Indian Americans we thought that the service was a poor representation of who we are. I don&#39;t blame the servers who were all very nice. Management needs to train their people and get organized because the food is good. Don&#39;t let the service mess up your business.

There are too many restaurant options, so I reached out to Jacqueline B and she came to the rescue.

After a super quick trip to Ikea today, I was starving. I had BBQ on my mind and didn&#39;t want to eat anywhere pricey or a place where I had to tip. It was suggested that I give Hickory Roasters a try. And, it was the best and most perfect recommendation ever! My hubby doesn&#39;t eat beef, and here he had all the chicken options possible. BBQ or grilled, they roast it right on site in their big giant oven. 

I opted for a pulled pork sandwich with cheese on it. It was exactly what I wanted at the time, and my side of potato salad was hearty and beyond delicious. My pork sandwich was good, and my hubby&#39;s lemon pepper chicken on a pita was juicy and spicy amazing.

The decor isn&#39;t much, but it&#39;s clean and the owners seem like family. The pricing is extremely reasonable, and they have a variety of hot and cold sides to accompany your sandwich. No frills decor + fantastically satisfying and memorable food + pricing that makes me excited to come back and bring the kiddos next time around. 

Hickory Roasters is the best value going with daily specials."

I was looking for something different for lunch near Schaumburg and decided to give this a try with the wife and kids. It takes a while to parse out your options, but in the end I went with a roasted 1/4 chicken (for some reason, dark meat only) with apple crisp and papas al diablo.

I&#39;m a big fan of the chicken, which, being dark meat, was very moist and tender. The skin had nice crackly bits of hickory-flavored char. Otherwise the rest of the chicken tasted lightly smoked.

The sides, thus far, are a big plus here. The potatoes were a little bit spicy and spiked with vinegar, making for a tender, flavorful side. And the apple crisp had the right blend of crispy crumbles atop sliced warm apples. For the more adventurous, go for the $5.95 Four Sides Special.

The barbecue cheddar sandwich was less successful, largely because about a third of it was pretty dry and the barbecue sauce was oddly sweet, which wasn&#39;t something I was expecting from a place that hickory smokes their chicken.

I&#39;m not sure if the kids meal chicken tenders are breaded in-house, but they were pounded flat, moist, juicy, and blazing hot. So those were a success overall.

To be honest, if they pitched the barbecue sauce that was on the sandwich in exchange for the stuff that was in the cup, I think these guys would be doing the sandwich very well. Overall, worth a visit!"

Hell No.  The last time I checked I was in Rolling Meadows, IL, and hoped that the BBQ was as decent as the Yelp reviews.  

I tried both the chicken &amp; the ribs, and while both had a &#34;smoky&#34; flavor, both were extremely dried out. &#34;Falling off the bone&#34; is a term most of us would equate with above average BBQ ,however In this case, even though the meat literally fell from the bone, it had been held in a warming cabinet for an extended period.  

Side dishes were purchased from a restaurant supply company, either frozen or from a can/box.   Corn muffin was the outlier.  It actually tasted good!   

To salvage the BBQ ribs ribs, I cut the meat off the bone, and fried it up with some leftover rice, veggies &amp; soy sauce.  Now that was some awesome fried rice."

I should mention we are from the south and know real southern/comfort/home cooking. 
Walked in with high hopes that were quickly dashed. 
The workers were super nice and they have free refills, so that&#39;s good....BUT the 
Mashed potatoes are instant, thin and watery. 
Mac and cheese is thin, bland and watery. 
Green beans are made in a marinara sauce.....enough said about that.
The corn is dry, hard and weird, a few times I thought I was eating teeth. 
The chicken is average at best. 
The barbecue sandwich is straight up manwich sauce from a can. 
The corn bread was actually really good. 

We asked for lots of extra butter and tried to doctor it all up....but a pig in lipstick is still a pig. 

If you know good southern cooking or are craving/wanting to try real southern cooking don&#39;t let this be the place you do that in."

I can&#39;t even imagine how anyone with taste buds could eat here. The staff is very friendly but that&#39;s it. The food is cafeteria grade at best and frankly just disgusting.

The chicken was smoked and dried out like it had been sitting for days. The display of sides looked like the cafeteria at Ikea.  Everything looked fake and obviously it had been reheated several times. The corn was the most bland corn I have ever tasted.When you ate it was juicy full of water because it had probably been sitting for days. The roasted potatoes had a kick yet they were bland.How can you mess up potatoes?  The mac and cheese was definitely out of a box.

After a couple bites of each item I was so grossed out I ended up throwing it all away. To top it off for the next day I had the worst stomach ache. Why anyone goes here beats me. The place is just downright gross. Honestly Mcdonalds next door would taste 10 times better and if you want a chicken dinner with good sides I recommend going to boston market. At least there its fresh and doesn&#39;t make you sick."

We (hubs and I) eat here whenever we are in a bind for dinner. There&#39;s a daily special for every day of the week. Sunday is $11.99 for a full rack of ribs and two sides- two normal people can eat this. Perhaps add one side BUT there is plenty of meat.

Restaurant is ran by a husband and wife that make all of the food from scratch every day. They are very nice people and give great recommendations when ordering off of the menu.

Great place to pick up food, stop by after shopping at Woodfield  Mall, or just eat here because you love BBQ and all your comfort-food sides at your fingertips."

First off, the chicken is really tasty! Nice and juicy and falls right off the bone. I love their tomato and cucumber salad, delicious! One of the best things is you can get a meal with a basic protein and then 2 sides of your choice, customizing it to be as healthy or un-healthy as you like!

I was hoping Hickory Roasters would deliver like the broasted chicken at Boston Blackies. Alas, no.

It&#39;s a humble joint. Reminds me of a cafeteria where you peruse the menu really quickly, place your order with the nice staff behind the counter, pay at counter and find a seat.

The customers are mostly working-class folks intermingled with a few  quasi white-collar office workers like us.

We order the famous, &#34;back by popular demand&#34; pot roast for about $7. And  of course the roasted chicken, which was spinning in the spit (and yes, we spied hickory wood near it). They come with choice of 2 sides, which include the staple assortments of mac and cheese -- a runny concoction looks like it came out of a wholesale tub -- mashed potatoes (flavorless and goopy wet), garlic potatoes (overly salted), Italian green beans, corn (both waterlogged) etc

We were highly disappointed in it and we had hoped so hard for a good joint. The pot roast came out of a small container kept in an oven and it was dry and salty. And no gravy could salvage it. And the chicken was dry and heavily seasoned, as well.

When I went, there were two young (late teens?) workers behind the counter and they were speaking to customers in Spanish. When it was our turn they must&#39;ve heard us speaking to each other in English b/c they spoke to us in English. No language barrier problems here!

They were very patient going over ice cream flavor and giving us samples. 

We ended up with an elote (on the cob, not in the cup, although they have both), a paleta, and an ice cream cone!

I live in NYC now, but I will DEF be back here when I&#39;m visiting home. The elotes in NYC are terrible and simply cannot compete with how Chicago does it (as is the case with MANY foods), and even the &#34;exotic&#34; ice cream flavor selection in this shop rivals those that you find in shops in NYC&#39;s Chinatown.  I also liked how they make their ice cream in-house, at least that&#39;s what the guy told us... Lol"

Not too many reviews but the Yelp picture of mango ice cream with tamarind looked too good to not try. 

Some older reviews said service was not friendly. That&#39;s definitely changed. All three employees where very friendly and patient considering I didn&#39;t know what half of the ice creams were made out of. They let you taste until you find a flavor you like, but everything I tried was awesome. I decided not to change my mind from getting the mango with tamarind sauce (delicious!) but after tasting several samples, I&#39;m definitely coming back to try the others. Next on my list is guava and the black one (they only knew the Spanish name and didn&#39;t know if there was an English translation).

When that profound sense of displacement hits, it&#39;s natural to look for something familiar: La Michoacana everywhere are run by the wonderful folks from the Mexican state of Michoacán, home to many traditional Mexican recipes (thanks for letting me know, Sofia) and I am a huge fan for their paletas (ice pops)--just what a muggy afternoon called for. 

Guided by Yelp and GPS, I drove to one of the nearest La Michoacanas--the sole one-star review didn&#39;t deter me--only to find a dental office at the address. Somebody had a wicked sense of humor I guess, as La Michoacana is known for its decadent frozen treats. But seeing that the area is dotted with Hispanic businesses, I pressed on, and found it two lots over (Yelp originally listed the street number as 2071 not 2103). 

I went inside and was greeted by the familiar sight of a variety of paletas as well as ice cream in open chest freezers. A lady came to help me but I soon realized the language barrier was bigger than what I experienced before. I looked up and decided to rely on the list of flavors (in both English and Spanish) though it didn&#39;t seem complete. With my funny pronunciation (hey, I can barely speak English, let alone Spanish), I was able to ask for a few flavors (some new and some familiar), and got a horchata, which, as a yelp friend put it, you should always be drinking, to go. She was very kind to show me the coffee and the tamarind side by side so I could tell the color difference. There appeared to be two different prices for the paletas, depending on whether it&#39;s cream based or water based, but the price difference is negligible(a dime a piece I think?). 

I finished those paletas in the next few days. Strawberry and cream was fabulous; coffee was good. These are basically ice cream on a stick (a big stick I may add). 

I love pineapple but won&#39;t get the pineapple flavor again, because it&#39;s just frozen pineapple pieces and the pineapple was not fully ripened so it was just bland; the tamarind flavor was way too tart for me. 

It pains me to give a La Michoacana less than four stars as I am a fan but the flavors of water-based paletas were quite underwhelming, plus I didn&#39;t see my favorite prune flavor..."

The ice cream is INCREDIBLY good &amp; flavorful. I&#39;ve never had better anywhere else, But their staff... Was never friendly about a year ago. They would never great, &amp; were kind of rude. That is what lead me to go from being a regular, to stop coming for over a year.

The pizza is more Detroit style than anything you typically get around here. It&#39;s square, medium thickness crust that is a combination between chewy and crunchy, with nice caramelized cheese on the edges. No too heavy on the toppings, good flavor to the sauce. 

The burgers are good 1/3 pounders with very nice brioche buns.

The fries are fresh cut and fried on the dark side-- and one serving is absolutely huge!  

They have topped fries that look very good-- in fact, everything looks good. 

While I&#39;ve not tried the beef, reports are it&#39;s good. They have a sort of philly cheesesteak-italian beef hybrid sandwich that&#39;s reported to be excellent.

I especially want to try some of their different toppings for the fries as they have several tempting options.  The &#34;personal&#34; pizza was perfect for 2 of us to share as they load on the toppings and cheese (4 square slices in the personal size).  The veggie toppings on the one we had were quite fresh &amp; plentiful in addition to the sausage &amp; pepperoni...and the ooey gooey cheese!  I like how the cheese is all the way up to the edges of the pizza and forms a nice crisp cheese crust along the edges.  The pizza was definitely a knife &amp; fork deal to start and then once you got your slice down a bit you could pick it up.

I got an Italian Beef and onion rings, cost was almost $11.00.

The burger was really good, probably better than Portillo&#39;s if you aren&#39;t a big fan of char-broiled. The Italian beef was not on the level of Portillo&#39;s, however. Too salty, and the hot peppers was an odd mix that was not meant for an Italian beef (gotta have a real giardinara). Pricing was about the same as Portillo&#39;s (definitely not cheaper as I saw on other reviews). Would return to try the gyro, meatball, or pizza."

Immediately heard several young man in the kitchen area yelling at each other and swearing. Nice! I gave the girl at the counter my name for a pick up order. She called out a pick up number to the people in the kitchen who were still yelling (including one who claimed he was a manager) and they didn&#39;t even acknowledge the counter girl or myself the customer! She had to call out the number again and tell them there was a pick up waiting. One of them finally grabbed the bag and tossed it on the counter. When I got home they got the order wrong. We ordered one sausage and one beef sandwich on white bread. Both were on garlic bread. My beef sandwich had NO beef on the last 2 inches of the bun. I&#39;ve never seen that before. Also my onion rings were cold. I&#39;m all for supporting a small business. But they must make an effort to want to keep my business. It seems like this place has gone downhill. And the owner doesn&#39;t seem to It&#39;s not what it used to be. I won&#39;t be going back there anytime soon.
Update. 12-1-15
Tried this place again. Garbage. 
My sausage tasted like garbage and that&#39;s where it went. My Wife&#39;s chicken sandwich was so so. More Spanish people there now.  They can&#39;t seem to get a basic sandwich right. Pizza is o.k. For a good sandwich go across the street to the Beef Villa."

I&#39;ve been ordering from here for about 2 years now and I&#39;ve been able to try a lot more items from the menu.  Nothing has really let me down yet.  I&#39;ve also had consistently great service when ordering pick-up and delivery.  Thanks guys!



Having recently moved to Elgin from downtown Chicago, I was a little skeptical about finding a decent pizza place to order from.  But, I&#39;ve ordered from Geno&#39;s about 4-5 times now and it&#39;s always been solid.  The delivery people have always been prompt and friendly too.

I&#39;ve only ordered thin crust pizzas, but I think I&#39;ve ordered most of what they have to offer in that department, and I&#39;ve never been let down.  After reading other reviews, I think I need to get a sandwich next time though.  It&#39;s not super cheap for pizza in the area, but if you use one of the coupons they are distributing everywhere, you can usually get a pretty decent amount of food for your money.

Conclusion:  It&#39;s not &#34;life-changing&#34;-ly delicious pizza, but I doubt it will ever let you down.  Their menu is HUGE too, so it&#39;s very possible that there are other great items on the menu I just haven&#39;t had yet either."

By the way, I never eat in there; it&#39;s not really meant to be a sit-down restaurant. It&#39;s a neighborhood pizzeria serving, primarily, the immediate neighborhood. I get the impression that many neighborhoods in the Chicagoland area have pizzerias of this quality, but I think this just speaks to the high quality of Chicago pizzerias.

Their pizza crust is a perfect example of what should come to mind when you think Chicago-style thin crust. My entire family raves about the pizza every time we order it.

We have ventured into other areas of the menu at Geno&#39;s -- including garlic bread, mozzarella sticks, deep dish pizza, meatballs (YUM) and pastas. They are all pretty good, but the pizza just can&#39;t be beat. I will say however that I am not a huge fan of their deep dish/thick crust pizza. The thin crust is much tastier and just seems to be cooked better than I have ever found the deep dish to be.

Delivery is always REALLY fast -- which helps when you have hungry children.  But we actually usually go in for pickup since it saves us a few dollars and we&#39;re just right down the street anyway. Geno&#39;s is meant to be a pickup/delivery pizza place, so I wouldn&#39;t really recommend it as a sitdown dinner location. There just isn&#39;t enough space to sit down for a meal.  So don&#39;t let the tiny store front fool you! The pizza is GREAT and you will not be disappointed.

We also love the deal where you save the tickets from your pizzas and once you have 10 you get half off your second pizza. It&#39;s nice when businesses reward customers for their loyalty.  =)"

By the way, I never eat in there; it&#39;s not really meant to be a sit-down restaurant. It&#39;s a neighborhood pizzeria serving, primarily, the immediate neighborhood. I get the impression that many neighborhoods in the Chicagoland area have pizzerias of this quality, but I think this just speaks to the high quality of Chicago pizzerias. So yes, you can find other places like this in Chicago, but it&#39;s still a five-star product."

Their pizza crust is a perfect example of what should come to mind when you think Chicago-style thin crust. My entire family raves about the pizza every time we order it.

We have ventured into other areas of the menu at Geno&#39;s -- including garlic bread, mozzarella sticks, deep dish pizza, meatballs (YUM) and pastas. They are all pretty good, but the pizza just can&#39;t be beat. I will say however that I am not a huge fan of their deep dish/thick crust pizza. The thin crust is much tastier and just seems to be cooked better than I have ever found the deep dish to be.

Delivery is always REALLY fast -- which helps when you have hungry children.  But we actually usually go in for pickup since it saves us a few dollars and we&#39;re just right down the street anyway. Geno&#39;s is meant to be a pickup/delivery pizza place, so I wouldn&#39;t really recommend it as a sitdown dinner location. There just isn&#39;t enough space to sit down for a meal.  So don&#39;t let the tiny store front fool you! The pizza is GREAT and you will not be disappointed.

We also love the deal where you save the tickets from your pizzas and once you have 10 you get half off your second pizza. It&#39;s nice when businesses reward customers for their loyalty.  =)"

I found myself going to Elgin the other day, and since Geno Nottolini&#39;s had a good yelp review I thought I&#39;d try it out.

If this is the best pizza Elgin can serve up, frankly, it&#39;s time to move!

It&#39;s not that the pizza is *bad*.  It isn&#39;t *bad*, it&#39;s jut not all that *good*, either.  We ordered a...  a meat something-or-other bomb.  Basically, throw ham, canadian bacon, pepperoni, and sausage on a pizza.  As a bonus, they have coupons so that when you order an XL anything, you get a small cheese.

Welllllll...  as I was saying, the pizza isn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s absolutely nothing to write home about.  Both the meat bomb and the small cheese had enough oil on them to make Saudi Arabia look over their shoulder.  The thick crust was decent, and though others didn&#39;t particularly care for it I kind of dug their &#34;hey, there&#39;s a breadstick around the edge&#34; approach.  The sauce was only so-so, which is where I believe GN&#39;s pizza really falls down; it&#39;s slightly sweet but doesn&#39;t have much seasoning beyond that.  It&#39;s main contribution to the pizza is really its red coloring rather than flavor.  Toppings were pretty good; sausage was actual sausage rather than reconstituted dog food that most places have.  Pepperoni was fair but not stellar, and everything else kind of blended together.

The atmosphere, well, it&#39;s a pizza place tucked into a strip mall.  Can&#39;t expect a lot there.  Six tables out front where you can sit and eat, but they&#39;re pretty tight.  Really this place is intended as a pickup/delivery operation and that&#39;s about it.

In short, if I was at someone&#39;s place and they ordered pizza from here, I&#39;d eat it.  But if they gave me a choice, I&#39;d probably explore around to see if there are better options.  Edible, but not stellar.

I loved the al pastor, but the asada was definitely the best I&#39;ve had in a long time.  Because my colleague and I felt we were having a long day at work, we opted for some flan as well.  Whenever I have flan, I get a very small sliver of a piece because I know how unhealthy it is.  You get a pretty generous portion, which I was not able to finish.

Service was great - the guy at the counter was very friendly, and not in that fake, customer-service way.  He seemed like a nice guy, happy to share the amazing food they had to offer.

I got steak tacos with lettuce, tomato and cheese. It came with beans and rice. They gave me a green and a red salsa (he even warned me the red one was kind of spicy). The tacos were awesome. The steak was really tender/flavorful and everything was just really fresh and delicious. The salsas were awesome.

The only complaint I have about the food is the guacamole. I ordered a side of it, and it was like 90% tomatos/onions and only 10% avocado. But I hardly ended up using it because of the AMAZING tacos/salsa/beans, so I would hate to take off more than 1 star.

So this review is strictly based on that experience. Right now I&#39;m chewing down on one of their newer offerings. Butternut squash, carmelized onion, and bacon. This is so good. I ended up leaving the church with 4 pizzas total (different varieties). It&#39;s going to be difficult to not eat one every day. 

Hoping to make it out to the actual location one of these days to try other things. But if the focaccia pizza is any indication, you&#39;re missing out by not checking this place."

Time of my visit: Lunch hours

This was my first visit here.  I decided to try it based on all the marvelous Yelp! reviews.

It is kind of tucked away off of Lake street, the street you suppose to turn on does not have a light.

It was smaller than I anticipated, three tables, counter and a cash register with nice blackboard type menus hanging on the wall.  Had a bit of a euro feel to it.

A nice lady came out and greeted me and asked me what I wanted.  I asked for a recommendation and she suggested I get Italian Sub.  My only concern was it had spicy capicollo, due to my ignorance I did not know if it was more of flavorful or hot, turned out to be flavorful.  I took a 10&#34; sub and placed my self at the table.

It did not take long for it to come out.  I was impressed by how quickly they made my sandwich.  It looked really thick!  They did not skim on the meat!  Plus - number one!  I took a first bit and was mesmerized by the bread, it was soft, but firm enough where it was not falling apart, plus - number two.  The meats and cheeses tasted fresh, juicy and high quality!

Even though I thought the price was a bit high, but it was definitely worth it!  A+!  I will come back again!"

The bread was nice and warm, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside! I could tell it was recently baked. The Pesto spread complemented the turkey like the sun complements the day! I also added giardinara peppers and that was the kicker! Will be back if I&#39;m around the area."

Awesome flavors. Perfect combination of condiments. Everything was nice and fresh. The large was big enough to comfortably split over 2 days. The only drawback is that the bread was a little to stiff for me, which in my opinion pushes out the contents when I bite into the sandwich. I like my bread soft but still a little firm.

However, I can definitely see myself returning here. Maybe next time, I&#39;ll request my bread a little softer."

It is probably one of the best Italian subs I have ever had. The bread they use alone is delicious. It has the perfectly baked crust on the outside, with hints of butter and salt. The balsamic drizzle on the soft yet slightly chewy interior is a great compliment. The meat and cheese tastes fresh. If I had an Italian grandmother make me a sandwich, I imagine this is what it would taste like. It comforts you and makes you forget all your troubles!"

It&#39;s pretty small inside, but luckily enough we were the only ones there at the time. A majority of the guys got the Italian sandwich, one got a meatball sandwich and I got the caprese. I can&#39;t fully speak for the other people, but I heard no complaints and it seemed like everyone thoroughly enjoyed their lunches!!! I got the 6&#34; caprese since I didn&#39;t want to be too full (everyone else got the bigger sandwich size and ended up bringing some home). My sandwich was great! Everything tasted so fresh and the bread had the perfect soft interior with a little crunch on the outside. The oil and basil mix added a crisp flavor that really kicked it up. After lunch, one of the guys had gotten some of the soft lemon cookies and shared them. They were so soft!! They didn&#39;t crumble in your hands, but right when they hit the inside of your mouth the whole cookie would just melt in your mouth. What a delightful end to lunch!"

Well there&#39;s a reason I finished mine and didn&#39;t change it and when my nephew told them they corrected it in seconds and you can see the look on his face right before he tore into it!!

Great lil cafe with awesome FRESH FLAVORS!! Give&#39;em a try... I know we&#39;ll be back!!

UPDATE!! They wouldn&#39;t let me pay?!? We finished their delicious works of art but since it wasn&#39;t what we ordered they were adamant not to accept payment... WHO DOES THAT!?! A family owned restaurant who&#39;s been in business for over a decade!! Love these guys &amp; gals!! :)"

I legit drove passed this place three times and turned into two parking lots before I pulled into the right one. Whoops!! Anyhoo, we came here all the way from Elgin to grab some lunchy poo and although pasta and more pasta sounded like my kinda lunch I played it safe with a turkey sandwich and my friend tried their Italian beef because some other yelpers claimed it was better than Johnnie&#39;s Beef. 

When I say &#34;played it safe&#34; I really did not expect this glorious sandwich placed in front of me. It was huge and came on this great foccacia bread with olive oil, GOOD balsamic vinegar and a little mayo with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and turkey. All the ingredients in between are important but let me tell you my fellow yelpers the foccacia bread they served this sandwich on is THE TRUTH. My friend said their beef was next level but he liked mine way better, which I agreed because previously stated that sandwich is THE TRUTH. I mean this sandwich was so good we drove an hour and thirty minutes the next day from the city to come back to roselle to get this unforgettable sandwich.

On our trip back we spoke to a gentleman who happened to be Mario (yes, the sandwich is named after him ) he told us they go to three different farmers markets every week to get fresh food. He took the time to make small talk and you know what I appreciate that. I enjoyed talking with him and of course I had to give him feedback on how awesome that sandwich is and how we drove back all that way for this sandwich. We ordered their pasta salad, pepperoni pizza, vegetable pizza, and lemon cookies and they were all phenomenal. Before we left, Mario threw in some free peanut butter brownies which probably went straight to the butt but hey real men should like that anyways right !? ;) 

Elena&#39;s is a hidden gem but I don&#39;t want it to be hidden. I want their business to do well, which telling by their postcards on their wall they looking like they are doing just fine. I hope people see this review and come to try out their food and enjoy it as much as I did."

It&#39;s primarily a catering operation, however if you knock on the door three times in the correct sequence, they just might let you in for lunch. That&#39;s what happened to me.

Elena&#39;s is a family operation and they have fun with it  No one is in a hurry here...so be patient and follow my lead.

My advise to you, whatever you order, get the biggest portion possible. I order for carryout only because seating is limited, but I&#39;m sure your sandwich will taste just as good standing up as opposed to sitting down.

This is a professional Deli that operates with confidence. No bullshit, they just make it happen.

Order extra because everything tastes better the second day!"

It&#39;s almost a unfair to review Elena&#39;s Deli as a lunch spot when 1.) it&#39;s clearly focused on being good at the catering side of the business, which means what you&#39;re served tends to come out of what they&#39;ve made to cater, and 2.) if you do stop by for lunch, you&#39;re probably going to have to take it up.

But we had a place to sit. And the food was awesome.

My wife had a prosciutto and bocconcini sandwich, which is topped with balsamic vinegar, some parmesan and fresh tomatoes. Bocconcini, it turns out, is not broccolini: it&#39;s actually a very soft, moist, tangy mozzarella cheese. On top of perfectly cured, savory prosciutto. With a deep, richly flavored balsamic permeating the sandwich bread. I liked this sandwich better, and it wasn&#39;t even my sandwich--which is a rare feat.

Not to say my meatball sub wasn&#39;t good. On the contrary; it&#39;s the best meatball sub I&#39;ve ever had. The meatballs were perfectly made; tender, with clearly identifiable parmesan notes. The tomato sauce was chunky, fresh and excellent, and there was a layer of parmesan underneath.

Both sandwiches were served with a bag of Jay&#39;s chips, which I appreciated.

Elena&#39;s Deli may very well be the best deli on Lake Street in the whole state."

HUGE portions, QUALITY sandwiches, and CHEAP. These sandwiches can last two meals and the ingredients are top notch. And they&#39;re only around 7 dollars with a bag of lays chips. More than anything anyone can ask for. So, I called in to place an order for take out and I recommend doing that since it takes them around 15-20 minutes to make sandwiches. Parking is a bit tricky, you need to turn in on the side street and go in to the parking lot but maneuver around the mall. However, well worth the sacrifices.

I ordered a large eggplant Parmesan sandwich and a large Mario sandwich and both were phenomenal. I had half of each and my taste buds are well treated. The various meats in the Mario sandwich were high quality and thinly sliced. There were some onions, tomato, and I really like the sauce they used although I can&#39;t tell what it is. The eggplant is perfectly cooked, silky and smooth, and it&#39;s paired with the best crust, sauce, and cheese. The bread they use is to die for. It&#39;s chewy and a bit tougher but all to the perfect amounts.

I&#39;m going to have to try their catering sometime. Definitely give this place a try!"

It is in sort of a strange complex that you have to drive around the back of it to get to it.
 Small place inside. I was the only one there at the time. I ordered an Italian Sub sandwich to go. Waited just a few minutes before it was ready.
Now this review is for the sandwich only, I did not try anything else. The sandwich did come on some excellent crusty bread. I really like excellent crusty bread so that is a plus. It had all of the standard Italian meats along with a bit of shredded lettuce and dressing. No tomato. I like tomatoes on my sub so thar was a little disappointing. Not sure if it was omitted or if that is the way they serve them. I thought the sub was pretty good. Was it the best I&#39;ve ever had? Nope, but it was a solid version that I would order again.
  I will return to try other items like the Italian Beef.

Cheers to All

PS: I need to point out that there was a tomato slice on my sandwich as pointed out by a sharp eyed yelper.
I did not notice it when I looked at one half. Oops on my part."

I don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t like lemon or have an aversion to citrus - her lemon cookies are beyond. Beyond delicious. Fragrant. Perfectly dressed with just the right amount of sweet frosted topping. Soft in the middle, but substantial elsewhere. If I haven&#39;t convinced you to score a lemon cookie, I might as well retired my Macbook right now. Get yourself a lemon cookie.

And yes, Elena&#39;s has all sorts of tasty morsels beyond the aforementioned glorious lemon cookies. She has foccacia, soups, salads, fried zucchini, stuffed peppers, soups, and plenty more. My fam and I stopped in to this teeny Italian deli to grab a few pre-made items for an easy Sunday dinner and here&#39;s how it went down...

Foccacia: 5/5: Flavorful hunk of delicious bread roasted and toasted with delightful toppings like hunks of cheese, roasted tomato, basil and more. 

Pasta fagioli: 4/5: A classic Italian soup made with tons of starch (lots of noodles, beans, bits of ham). Elena&#39;s is good but a little too starchy for me - we had to thin it out quite a bit and add plenty of red pepper to liven it up. 

Stuffed peppers: 4.5/5: Nicely put together and a bit spicy! 

Spaghetti squash: 5/5: These squash bakes were a huge hit with me and my 2 year old. Tons of flavor and the right amount of crisp! 

Cannolis: 4.5/5: Even at the end of the day you can still get a delicious cannoli, albeit frozen. Cannolis should be either freshly piped or frozen to ensure a fresh experience! No one wants a sad, soggy cannoli shell. And they&#39;re bookended with pistachios. The. Way. It. Should. Be. 

I&#39;m a big fan of Elena&#39;s and surely I&#39;ll be back soon...at least to procure a dozen lemon cookies."

There are a couple of glass cases inside with 2 small tables with 4 total chairs.  

But in the back is where the magic happens.  Fresh baked made in-house bread.  Balsamic vinegar on sandwiches to add more flavor.  Pesto to elevate the caprese sandwich.  I am not a vegetarian but decided to run through the gauntlet of sandwiches and tried the eggplant parmesan.  Their son Mario mentioned their top 3 selling sandwiches being the Mario&#39;s Italian, Salvatore&#39;s prosciutto and bocconcini, and Elena&#39;s caprese, but the eggplant parm is one very underrated star on their menu.  Thinly sliced and lightly breaded but full of flavor.  We also took home some arancini which are smaller than others so you get more crunch for the bite.  The large focaccia have a crispy bottom but soft interior that is so enjoyable on its own.  They gave us a sample of tomato and garlic knots which were also phenomenal.

That&#39;s the kind of relationship I&#39;m in. He&#39;s the Felix Unger and I&#39;m Oscar Madison all the way. 

He&#39;s neat, orderly, disciplined, reasonable, practical, genius-level smarts and for the most part, incredibly kind (though he doesn&#39;t seem to fancy cats much).

I&#39;m a mess. I leave crap everywhere. I rarely clean up after myself. I&#39;m terrible with money, even worse with math, and there&#39;s actually been times (multiple) where I&#39;ve been so lazy that I&#39;ve actually lied about brushing my teeth. I know, I know. But at least I admit it. Sure, I should probably be more ashamed and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some deeper psychological stuff there, but for now we&#39;ll all just have to settle for my own admission of these facts and I&#39;ll just go on pretending that my level of sloppy is still cute and okay. 

How does this this bit of information take me to Elena&#39;s Cucina? Well, I&#39;ll tell you... just like I always do, whether you want to hear it or not.

People are always telling me how lucky I am to have my SO. No one EVER says the reverse to him. And I know they&#39;re right and that I should be thanking my lucky stars day in and day out, but sometimes... sometimes I think, &#39;This is it. This is the day I throw him from a moving vehicle if he doesn&#39;t pull that stick out of his ass right-quick.&#39;

Luckily, it only took one life-changing visit to a little storefront in a business park off Lake Street to find the perfect way to curb his (and my impending) crankiness: Order anything from Elena&#39;s Magical Cucina.

Priced for even a pauper like myself, you can get a heaping sandwich on fresh, homemade bread with the highest quality artisan ingredients. Fresh made pizza with homemade dough, fresh homemade focaccia bread, fresh and homemade pasta and more -- all fresh and all homemade right there on the spot! 

The shop is almost completely hidden from street view and while there are two tiny two-seater tables inside, it&#39;s main hub of business seems to be from catering/carry-out orders. It&#39;s counter service or call ahead, and while normally I&#39;m monstrously impatient and hate waiting, I actually had a really fun time just sitting and listening to my SO tell the play-by-play of our sandwiches being made in the back kitchen. 

Everything from pulling the fresh bread loaves, to slicing cheese straight from the block. This is as from-scratch as it gets, folks. You should expect your order, no matter if it&#39;s a salad or sandwich or pizza to take around 15-20 minutes, because like I said - EVERYTHING is done from scratch. They don&#39;t pre-make, slice, set anything so your food is fondled by as few people as possible before it hits your lips. 

On our virgin visit, Mario was manning the counter and put together both our veggie pesto sandwich and our Caprese sandwich. Mario, that dude... I owe my life as a free man to him for saving my boo and I from what could have been a very disastrous (possibly murderous) day of exploring the suburbs on an empty stomach together. 

Mario made us up these heaping sandwiches, though only 6-inches each according to the menu, we eye-balled them at closer to 7&#34; and spent the first minute and half of the sandwiches being placed in front of us in awe of how absolutely picturesque and perfect they were. Loaded with more-than-generous ingredient portions, this is the kind of food that&#39;ll make your Italian Nonna rethink her decades-old family recipes. 

Elena&#39;s... they do Italian deli right and unlike any other. I&#39;ve honestly never had anything quite like it and I&#39;ve never seen my SO&#39;s empty stomach+crabby patty mood dissipate so quickly. It was like we transitioned out of being The Odd Couple and moved into a more Darrin &amp; Samantha of Bewitched-type scenario where I just wiggled my nose (or in this case, ordered a sandwich) and all of a sudden Darrin&#39;s sourpuss turns to sparkles and smiles and we all have a happy ending.  

We ended up shaking Mario&#39;s hand before we left because we were so thankful to him for what he&#39;d done for us... made us the best damn sandwiches we&#39;ve ever had, and for $10 total for the both of us, no less. 

I know where I&#39;ll be getting all future parties catered from and I know where I&#39;ll be headed the next time I have a hankering for the best Italian sandwich on the planet... which as it turns out, is fairly often."

Just picked up a lunch order for my office.  I didn&#39;t cry while eating this sandwich, but that&#39;s because my co-workers would think I&#39;m even more of a loon.  But I digress...

My zucchini parm was on point.  Bread wasn&#39;t mushy, still warm a half hour later.  My mouth is watering and I just ate the thing. 

My friend that had the Mario looked at me wide eyed and said that the sandwich made it into his top three best sandwich&#39;s of all time.   Another co-worker explained that there was just something so special about the bread.  While another co-worker just made audible happy noises as he stuffed his face with the sausage focaccia.

In summary: yay."

They had a stuffed portobello mushroom that was phenomenal.   Ordered a 6&#34; roast beef (home made) that was fantastic.  --more like 8-9inches overstuffed. 

Now I know why people come back.   At the end of the meal Mario figured out who I was based on my review.   We talked for a bit, and his philosophy on food and eating is as refreshing add the flavors. 

A True Gem.   Anyone that goes to any deli or sandwich place within 15 minutes of here is wasting their gas. 

I would return here all the time if I lived locally.   They would be my choice for catering or special events where sandwiches, platters, salads, etc or desserts were called for.

I have been buying there delish foccacia from the farmers market for years.  I always knew they had a place but never made it out there as I was satisfied with my weekly fix from the market.  One day I had the brilliant idea to take the boyfriend and the teenager there for lunch...holy hell what was i missing????  He had the Italien sammich, I had the meatball sammich and the veggie teenager had the cesear salad.  All were phenominal.  We capped it off with the lemon cookies.   I think i just about died with happiness.  

Upon deciding on who would cater my daughters graduation, we pondered and then decided that Elenas should do the job.  Of course, we made this decision right about lunch time on a saturday...so off we went for lunch.  He got the italien again and I had one with prosciutto and burrata.  Im pretty sure I started crying at the table it was so good.  After inhaling lunch, we decided the catering and ordered 3 cheese lasagna, sausage and peppers, vesuvio potatoes and chicken tenders.  Everything was so good.  People are still talking about how good it was 2 days later.  I love this place.

This is a gem.  I will for sure be back for more food and im trying to think of another reason to cater another party.  Sammich, chicken tenders, sausage, potatoes, lemon cookies.  UGH! Now im hungry.  I love you Elena...like a fat kid loves cake.  Thank you!"

Went in not knowing what to expect because it&#39;s kind of tucked away in a little strip mall off Lake St and there is a pretty big hill in front of the building so it&#39;s hard to see.  I would say I have easily driven past this place hundreds of times and always wondered what it was.  Boy was I glad my husband asked me to go here!  First of all the gentleman behind the counter, Mario, was super friendly and professional from the minute I walked in the door.  There weren&#39;t any other customers there at the time I walked in and he greeted me within seconds.  I told him I had never been there before so I wasn&#39;t sure what to order.  He said they have daily specials and explained each one to me for that day.  I order what my husband wanted which was so fresh and honestly the best Italian sub I have ever tasted!  Crunchy bread, fresh lunch meat, tomato, lettuce, spices, and the dressing on the sandwich was so good.  I didn&#39;t taste the antipasto salad but it looked amazing.  I order eggplant parmesan with some meatballs and sauce.  Again, was very pleasantly surprised by the nice egg coating on the eggplant and the meatballs were soft and the sauce tasted homemade.  I also took a trip to their dessert case which had the best Italian lemon cookies I&#39;ve ever had!!!  So soft and moist with that delicious lemon glaze.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them again, a perfect cookie to have with your coffee.  I def recommend this place and we are planning to use them to cater our next family party now that we know the food is so fresh and amazing! :)"

I saw the meat and cheese being sliced on the spot for my sandwich and the ingredients were absolutely superb. Plus, kudos for thick cut cheese that I could taste in every delicious bite, made even more
perfect with the occasional infusion of sweet balsamic and oil. I topped off the meal with a lemon cookie which put every other lemon cookie I&#39;ve ever eaten to shame.

It is their product and their service that clearly keep people coming back.

I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to consider having them cater any event you need food for. No dish is a throwaway or an after thought. They want everything from the sides to the entrees to impress, and they do.

They have a fairly extensive assortment of foods not listed on the menu. These recline in the comfort of an immaculate display cooler. Zucchini patties? Check. Pickled Beets? Check. All their items are home made right there. 
Very tiny, only 2 small tables. Also, their location is somewhat odd; it&#39;s a light industrial building that houses several business that have nothing to do with consumers. You enter off the side street (Garden St.). Well worth the trip, large Mario only 7 clams, WITH a bag of chips!"

It is not the easiest place to access (or see) from lake street. But sometimes the best things are hidden. 

Also, if you are in a hurry, don&#39;t be! It&#39;s gonna take a few minutes to make your sandwich. Because they don&#39;t have a bunch of pre-sliced meats and cheeses laying around. They take the time to hand slice them up.

And if you order a large sandwich, you got enough for lunch the next day!  The small is more than enough even for a big eater.

I have been dreaming about Elena&#39;s sandwiches for weeks now, I just cant get them out of my head.  After just one bit I knew I was in for a wonderful experience and it just got better as the meal went on.  We split a veggie pesto sub and the Caprese sandwich, though I ended up eating more then my fair share since they were both so wonderful.  I just kept going back and forth each time forgetting how wonderful the other sub was until I took another bit.  All I remember saying is &#34;So good!  So good!  It is just so good!&#34;  So let me break it down.

Elena&#39;s subs are on fresh baked bread - this is good, chewy, Italian bread that makes you savor your sandwich.  The subs are packed full of goodness with extra thick cuts of cheese, I am talking 1/2 inch or better cuts of cheese.  That alone won me over but it gets better.  These sandwiches are made fresh with incredible detail and mindfulness that what comes out of the kitchen is a work of art.  O yeah, and the sandwiches were absolutely amazing, packed with so much flavor that I can say with out a doubt they are the best I have ever had.  All that for wonderfulness for Subway prices so it is definitely the best for the cost - no contest.  The bar and this cucina is set super high that I dont know if anyone else can compete, all future sandwiches I eat will have to compare to Elena&#39;s.  

Well anyway - the storefront itself is a nice, small, deli that feels a little bit like home.  There are a couple display cases of treats, some drinks in a cooler, two tables, a huge kitchen, and tons of photos and clippings on the walls.  It seemed like most of their business is catering or carryout but I enjoy dinning in, so we did and it ended up being a great choice.  It just feels like home and we were treated like family, making it a wonderful experience.  The only issue is that it is rather hard to find for first timers and for some reason GMaps could not get us there.  Lucky we found our way but if you are lost their website has a map of where they are located.  Overall I could not be more pleased with Elena&#39;s and I am just itching at the chance to come back!

P.S. The lemon cookies .... so good!"

I&#39;ve grown up in Roselle my entire life. There is nothing like this place. Their staff and their food is off the charts. We&#39;ve had two parties in the last 3 months that they catered for us. We were amazed by the quality."

I found out about Elenas from a woman while we were both waiting for our radiation treatment. I didn&#39;t know her but we both love food. She said they have the best meatball sandwiches. Was she right. My husband and I ordered a meatball and an Italian sub sandwich. I cannot tell you which one we liked more. Now I am a little picky when I go to Italian restaurants because I am Italian and I know good Italian. This food was great Italian. Even the bread was fantastic. And the best part was the service. A family business that treats you like faintly.
You won&#39;t be disappointed in the food. God bless you all.
Oh the only FYI not much seating. It&#39;s more of a take away."
elenas-cucina-roselle-2,Janni V.,GKZw9pVMesGBRfCR7Q_bgw,"Roselle, IL",0,1,1,82,44,uvV4cExjqKPFtgXcuPfJ1Q,5.0,2013-05-29,"Man, Elena&#39;s is so awesome at what they do, it makes me want to go back and revise a few things down a star in comparison. 

I&#39;d been here once a long time ago, but for some reason kept forgetting about it, even though it&#39;s super nearby. That&#39;s mostly because its hours just don&#39;t jibe with when I&#39;m usually thinking about needing some delicious Italian deli sandwiches, salads, and home cooking. 

Luckily, I stopped by for a sandwich and a salad the other day, since my SO had a day off and it seemed like a nice thing to share. 

When you go into Elena&#39;s, there&#39;s a nice little display case with some Italian cookies and freshly made food sitting in it. There are also a couple of little tables, and some cute homey decorations that make you instantly feel like this is a place that cares about what they do. Elena&#39;s does a lot of catering business, but they also have a little menu on a chalkboard behind the display cases. If you have trouble reading it, they also have paper menus available over by the register. 

They offer several sub, panini, and salad options -- and if you want to change what&#39;s on the menu? They&#39;re happy to accommodate you. At first, this might be a little intimidating. If you know what you want, however, you&#39;ll be fine.

For example, my SO really wanted a roast beef sandwich. He also loves grilled and roasted veggies (minus onion) and pesto. I saw the cold grilled veggie sandwich with pesto on the menu, and asked if they could add roast beef. 

The woman (Elena? Not sure. I should have asked -- she was so sweet!) smiled and said, &#34;Of course!&#34; 

Not only did she add roast beef -- she sliced it fresh right then and there. RIGHT THEN AND THERE, PEOPLE. She also let me add grilled eggplant to the sandwich. I ordered a large sub (subs come in 6&#34; or 10&#34; sizes) , which automatically comes with a bag of chips. My SO was so happy with his sandwich, he ate it very slowly -- something he never does. He also asked why we&#39;d never had Elena&#39;s food before. Another first: he couldn&#39;t finish the sandwich in one sitting. He ate it for lunch AND dinner. 

As for me, I ordered an antipasto salad for myself. I, too, didn&#39;t have room for dinner. That was a DELIGHTFUL salad. Homemade balsamic vinaigrette was perfect. Quality of the cured Italian meats in the sandwich couldn&#39;t be nicer -- and mmm, beautiful kalamata olives with perfect brininess! 

Of special note: in both the salad and the sandwich, the tomatoes were bursting with ripeness -- something which alone can win my heart over. I even said to the woman preparing my food, &#34;Thank you for using ripe tomatoes!&#34; She responded, &#34;I only like them when they&#39;re ripe, too.&#34; That? That&#39;s someone who cares. That&#39;s who you want preparing your food. 

The bottom line? Even something as seemingly simple as salads and sandwiches is greatly affected by the quality of the ingredients used. Elena&#39;s takes such pride in what they&#39;re doing that you can&#39;t ask for better. This will become a go-to place for us, I&#39;m sure. So they&#39;re not open for dinner? We&#39;ll just have to plan better so we can enjoy their deliciousness more often. :9"

I don&#39;t normally like lemon-flavored desserts, but both the flavor and texture of her cookies were outstanding. They&#39;re almost not really cookies--more like a mix between a scone and a cake, but shaped like a cookie, topped with ultra lemony icing. Box of 4 for $5. So worth it.

The focaccia, with an incredibly garlicky crust, was great. We weren&#39;t as much a fan of the zucchini parmesan. Both were on the salty side, but the spaghetti I cooked at home helped to tone it down.

Will be returning to try other dishes like the lasagne!"

I&#39;m no cook and yet I enjoy having friends over for a good meal and Elena&#39;s meals to go are always excellent.

I first discovered Elena&#39;s at the farmers market at Daley Plaza in Chicago.  They would often be sold out of the focaccia pizzas by Noon.  They also attend the Schaumburg Farmer&#39;s Market every Friday.  The Roselle restaurant isn&#39;t easy to locate, but one you find it I&#39;m sure you return over and over."

Was looking for some lunch today and decided to search yelp for lunch near my house.    Came across Elena&#39;s and couldn&#39;t tell off hand if it was a deli or just catering or both.   Gave them a quick call where Salvatore answered and said yes, they did serve lunch.   Dropped off my son at preschool and away we went.   

Walked into a small unassuming storefront and saw a nice glass case filled with lemon cookies and other pastries on one side and premade dishes on the other.   Decided on a few things for lunch including a meatball sandwich, proscuitto/fresh mozzarella sub, pasta salad and lemon cookies.   The owners were very nice, smiling and talking about their grand-daughter and giving suggestions.   Placed our order and waited.   

Prices were fine - about 20 bucks for all that food which was within reason.   

Got the food home and tore in.  Meatballs were excellent.   Not too dense, not too loose.  Sauce was good with them and the sandwich was stuffed.   Proscuitto/fresh mozzarella could have used a touch more meat, but they used an excellent balsamic vinegar on both sides of the sandwich that soaked into the bread and gave a great flavor.  The pasta salad was very good BUT the lemon cookies were to die for.   I&#39;m going back for more.  Seriously, like after I finish this review, I need more.

You can find their products at farmer&#39;s markets including Daley Plaza so if you see them, get them.  Will go back for the pizza and foccaccia."

I had the Italian roast beef sandwich.  It would have been good with just the roll it can on.  But the huge attack of roast beef put it way over the top.

No Subway style where they cheap out on all the good stuff and load up on the lettuce, these sandwiches are stuffed full of delicious deli meat and cheese!

The woman that made the sandwich was very nice as was the young man that was there. I mentioned that I was there due to their outstanding reviews.

I ended up getting a cold veggie sandwich and hot eggplant parmesan sandwich. Both were delicious. The eggplant was a bit mushy for my taste, but the flavor was delicious. Two small sandwiches and a box of lemon cookies came out to $18. I read the reviews on Elena&#39;s and everyone said to get the lemon cookies. I wasn&#39;t a big fan.

I was on going my lunch break and yelped a few places and found this deli. A sandwich sounded nice so I went searching for it. I could not have been more pleasantly surprised. This place is definitely a hidden gem!

As soon as I walked in I immediately felt welcome, they explained the menu and their case of freshly made pastas and meatballs. I ordered a 6 inch sub and a little bit of homemade pasta. I watched them make my sub and all the meet was freshly sliced. While I waited the owner brought out some baked eggplant on a plate for me to try. Once I got in the car, the pasta smelled so good that I actually had to stop and try it on the way back to the office. It was SO good I couldn&#39;t stop eating it.

Elena&#39;s Lemon Cookies: are like nothing I have ever tasted.  They are absolutely life-changing. I&#39;m not a big &#39;lemon&#39; flavored type girl...but with each bite of her lemon cookies...you feel hugs from the Italian grandmas you never had.  We fight over them at work and I take this cookie fight seriously.  

I have ordered a lot of sandwiches here both for lunch, and finger-style for seminars and events.  All of my clients love eating her food, its not just me that feels this way.  Elena treats every customer like they have never eaten before, and that you must try everything.  She wants to be sure that you have the best experience with her, and her food.

It has been a frustrating experience living in the suburbs and not having a place to grab a decent sandwich other than Smitty&#39;s on the Corner which sucks because they are closed on Sundays. I know they are located in a downtown area where most businesses are closed, but I wonder if they realize or care about how much money they are missing out on? At any rate, Deane&#39;s is thankfully open 7 days a week and I will happily continue to patronize them.
Besides being a deli, they also carry specialty items to include a great selection of artisan mustards, chips, house made herb butters, chicken pot pies, black bean patties, and quinoa granola just to name a few. Another thing that is awesome about this deli is that they offer a generous amount of samples of their food. Today they had samples of their fresh baked scones, chocolate chip cookies, the above mentioned herb butter with slices of french bread and their caprese bread. They were all delicious and provided you with a taste of the quality of food that is offered at Deane&#39;s. For lunch, we had the smoky chicken salad sandwich and the turkey sandwich. They were both very good, but lacked enough seasoning. They offer multi grain bread which is another plus. I will be back again this week specifically for their black bean hummus wraps..yum!"

The environment is great. It&#39;s nice and open, with a very chic-yet-rustic atmosphere. They have a nice selection of deli products in addition to the menu, too. I had a caesar wrap, and it would have been enjoyable had it not been so boring. I was expecting it to be a little more--what I got was some lettuce and croutons in a folded tortilla with a bit of dressing splashed in there. It didn&#39;t seem like there were any sides to accompany it either. The $8 price tag wasn&#39;t exactly worth it."

First, was surprised they used packaged bread/rolls from turano.  The key to success will be high quality food that&#39;s fresh and tasty.  I know your new but differentiating yourself from other places is key and off the shelf bread won&#39;t cut it.  Which leads me to the meats.  Turkey seemed fresh roasted but there was more dark meat than white with some grizzle.  Very odd.  Is it processed or freshly roasted?  If the former, not good, if the latter then buy better turkey breasts cause white meat is king.  Nice ambience, great location.  Nice owners too.  Best of luck!"

We were greeted by a lovely lady and told to sit wherever we like. The complimentary chips and salsa came pretty quickly and were pretty good although I&#39;m not really a fan of hot(temperature) salsa. The food didn&#39;t take very long at all and our waitress was very nice and a little sassy(in a good way). I ordered the taco dinner Al Pastor and my broseph ordered chips &amp; guacamole with a side of grilled jalapenos/onions, he&#39;s one of them there vegetarians. All of the flavors were good and we both joined the clean plate club, haha. So...

Do I dig the place? Sure

Food came out lickety-split. We tried 3 different tacos (beef, pork, and the mushroom - which was a special of the day) and all were really good.  They are small tacos you can buy individually so it&#39;s nice to try a variety and also to accommodate both small &amp; large appetites. Their salsas were darn good, too. Oh, and the cucumber margarita was soooooo delicous!

The only down side was the tortilla chips must have been sitting out in the basket to put on the table a bit too long as they weren&#39;t quite as crispy as they should have been.  There was no offer to refill the basket once we emptied it, either (it wasn&#39;t a huge basket of chips like you get at some places so we finished it off easily).  If it hadn&#39;t been for the chips and if it wasn&#39;t just our first time there I was tempted to give them 5 stars.

But the nice staff, quality of the tacos, salsas and margarita will bring us back to try them again the next time we are wandering around Batavia and in need of good grub, for sure!"

First: The margaritas. They didn&#39;t have frozen or blended (normally I&#39;m a rocks girl, but I was feeling blended on my first visit) so I ended up with a peach margarita. Actually... I had two peach margs. And part of a lime marg. And they were FANTASTIC. Child had her first horchata ever here, and she loved it. I was impressed. She thought it tasted like a &#34;liquid churro&#34; and that pretty much nails it. 

Housemade chips and salsa are solid, as is the guac. Queso fundido was excellent, as were the pork tacos and cheese enchiladas. (No, not all mine. But I&#39;m a taster.) But what keeps me coming back is the Bistec ala Mexicana. I can&#39;t stop. I&#39;m becoming a tad bit obsessed in that I want this for dinner every single night. 

Agree with other reviewers that you&#39;re not coming for the ambiance, but actually, sitting outside and people watching is quite nice. They do have some outdoor seating. And everyone here is really friendly. It&#39;s in a busy shopping center next to Batavia Creamery, and there always seem to be people coming and going. 

Takeout business seems to be fairly robust. Portions are smaller than what you get during dine-in, but still satisfying. 

I&#39;m a very happy camper having this place nearby."

The Steak Tacos can be very good or very dry with the texture of ball bearings. The meat crumbles as it falls from the shell and rolls around on the table at will.

The Taco Dorados can be the best around as long as the cook removes them from the deep fryer before they transform into &#34;Hot Pockets&#34;. The accompanying warm salsa is delicious and can be a substitute for a cup of soup. An occasional slurp is not out of the question.

The margaritas are highly recommended. They actually make an effort with the homemade formulation. Smart move on their part!

 The ambiance is limited and bordering &#34;drab&#34; however the service makes up for it. The ladies actually crack a smile or two!

The location is a small strip mall and parking is a premium, so if you can, ride your bicycle or better yet...hitch-hike."

Fresh crunchy, cole slaw (not the creamy kind!) Cilantro, pico de gallo and avocado slices topped this tasty treat. Other reviews stating the fish tacos were good were not wrong!

They have amazing authentic Mexican food for a very reasonable price unlike some of the &#34;upscale&#34; Mexican joints in this area. They have great value meals and my favorite is the 3 quesadilla meal that comes with a drink and rice and beans for $8.95 which you can&#39;t really beat. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone from the Mexican food aficionado to someone on a budget. They serve a hot salsa with great freshly made tortilla chips which are both delicious and the hot salsa is a little different but amazing!!

My husband ordered the burrito and liked it as well. Both orders came with rice, beans and a drink for about 8.95.  The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is we had to wait for refills on our drinks because our server was busy with tables inside and outside."

For starters, I&#39;ve been spoiled be El Faro in Elgin, which in my book is exactly what a little cheap Mexican place should be.

Here are my complaints:  first and foremost, the food just doesn&#39;t taste that good- I&#39;d say mediocre at best.  In addition, they have tried to up-sell us almost every time we&#39;ve been in there, which I find insulting and uncomfortable.  If they are experiencing financial trouble, maybe they should try improving their food before putting pressure on people to buy more.  When I order their taco combo, the portion of beans and rice was comically small- don&#39;t they realize that they&#39;d be better off serving ample portions of cheap things like B&amp;R? ( Here is a tip:  order three single tacos and a side of beans &amp; rice and you&#39;ll get more food.  But then they will badger you to get the combo....)  It was like a table spoon of each.....Which in light of my next complaint, I should be grateful for:  I then got an awful stomach ache.  Not sure how clean that place is....   Nothing is really that good there, including the runny salsa they serve with the chips.  Skip it and make your own, better tacos at home."

I&#39;m kind of hoping it will stay an undiscovered gem for just a little longer. Their food deserves to be known. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and all natural wood. It&#39;s a very classic log cabin atmosphere. It&#39;s classy yet casual.

With each meal, you receive unlimited soup refills and crusty bread with szmalec, a rendered pork fat spread with bacon or similar flavoring inside. It&#39;s heavy but a welcome change from the usual butter and very tasty. I tried a vegetable soup as well as mushroom soup. They kindly allowed me to switch varieties between my servings of unlimited soup. The service is friendly and fast! On game days the place is lively and filled with cheering fans.

I ordered chicken with roasted potatoes and beef stroganoff, which isn&#39;t like the Northern European version but more like a Hungarian goulash. Chicken was delicious and crispy skinned but perfect texture inside. The beef was delicious, cut into bite sized pieces, and tender. Plenty of food to take home to re-enjoy later. The goulash was served in a cute little suspended steel cauldron. That was a fun touch.

This restaurant deserves a lot more exposure than it currently has. It&#39;s also next to Helen&#39;s Polish deli, so you can pick up some kabanosy (dry sausages) or kielbasa for grilling later."

Really interesting looking log cabin on Irving Park Rd. about 5 miles from O&#39;Hare. You&#39;ll realize how close you really are to O&#39;Hare if you ever try and sit outside on a nice day. Don&#39;t do that. 

1/2 order of steak tartare is plenty for 2-4 people and a great appetizer. Some of the best tripe soup I&#39;ve ever had. Light grainy bread is homemade fresh and warm, and the lard vs butter option should be tried at least once.

Love the Schnitzel with 3 salads, big leftovers. Side polish salad just the way its supposed to be with a sour cream dressing, fresh and sour. All fried food should have an egg on top of it. Portions are large.

Bottomless Ice Tea in the cutest Polish log cabin in Chicagoland (most real Polish Peoples and children are drinking beer), wood on the walls, everywhere. See Nancy L&#39;s mo betta excellent review &#34;designed by Woody Woodpecker&#34;.  We are usually the only non Polish speaking people there. They will answer the phone as well as address us in Polish if they are looking at my partner who is half Polish. I look like the people that marched through Poland. Our last fantastic waitress Justina was wonderfully patient at deciphering our sad English. We have been working our way through their menu and love it and U Gazdy.

Very friendly and laid back, friendly boisterous is probably the right word for not quiet, a German rathskeller feel.  Nice easy wood bar seating and some high and low tables. The outdoor patio&#39;s nice when it&#39;s not too hot or cold and the planes aren&#39;t too low, hint the planes are always low here.  ENJOY U Gazdy."

Is it like German food?  Russian?  Ukrainian?  Can I pronounce anything on the menu?  Will I be the only person in there who doesn&#39;t speak Polish?  OMG THE STRESS.  

Now that I live super close to U Gazdy though, I HAD to finally check it out.  I mean, it COULD be our new favorite restaurant close to home, right? 

Seriously, this place is FREAKING DELICIOUS.  I&#39;ve never had Polish food before and this is some serious, stick-to-your-ribs, delectable food.  It was similar to the German specialties I have had before but with A LOT more flavor.  It&#39;s like they took German food and made it better.  And added more fat and butter.  Yum.  

They serve you bread and rendered pork fat (?) &#34;butter&#34; when you sit down right away.  That was awesome both in flavor and in keeping the baby occupied while we tried to figure out what to order.  Speaking of being nice to my baby (who was being a complete jerkstore by the way) the waitresses were all so sweet to her which is always appreciated.  The waitresses were actually all really good and helped each other out (with an additional food runner too) so everything was quick and service was really good.  But I digress...let&#39;s get back to the food.  We got the pierogis (1/2 meat and 1/2 potato and cheese), potato pancakes, the breaded veal (sorry, I am too lazy to see how to spell it in Polish), and the blood sausage (see aforementioned laziness with the proper name) and it was all AWESOME.  My partner thought the veal could&#39;ve been more tender (or something...I couldn&#39;t really hear him over my chewing and raving about the food...oh, and the jerkstore baby)  but everything else was SO GOOD.  And all the portions were so huge we actually had two meals...one dinner and one lunch the next day.  I&#39;m not going to go into too much detail because I feel like everything I ordered has been raved about in other reviews but suffice it to say if you don&#39;t eat this blood sausage dish before you die, you will regret it for all of eternity.  

I will be back, U Gazdy.  I love you and your Polish food.  The beer I will have to get used to, but the food?  TRUE LOVE."

Well, for one - I don&#39;t eat Polish food often, more like once in a blue moon.  Yes, I&#39;ve had the more common Pierogis, and stuffed cabbage, but that&#39;s the extent of my Polish adventures.

And two -  This restaurant is &#39;blink your eye&#39; and you&#39;ll miss it. I&#39;ve drove past it a hundred times and never knew it existed.  Your dead giveaway will be Helena&#39;s Polish Deli (large signage) right next door in front of a tiny parking lot..

The exterior &amp; interior is very cabin-esque throughout. Tables, chairs, walls..think Woody Woodpecker. Decent bar area with good amount of seating.  Warm, cozy and casual Euro feel.  Plenty of Polish diners when we arrived (always a good sign).  We were greeted instantly and service was spot on.  Menu items explained.  A hearty, meaty and starchy selection of traditional home style Polish fare.  

Complimentary grain bread with lard spread arrived first.  Lard was a first for me. No, I don&#39;t make a habit out of eating lard, but I was excited to taste it.  Mixed with bacon pieces and I&#39;m not sure what else.  Our waitress described it but I couldn&#39;t quite make out what she said due to her Polish accent, so I just nodded and smiled.  I can only describe it as unique and yes, lardy...its definitely worth a taste and not off-putting at all.  Just take another Lipitor if your watching your cholesterol.  I wouldn&#39;t go &#34;hog-wild&#34; on it...

We wanted to taste a variety of appetizers &amp; two entrees...so our group of three shared:

-Pierogis appetizer - serving of 10.  You can mix 1/2 &amp; 1/2 but I asked if we could try 3 varieties instead of 2.  Our server was reluctant at first but since the kitchen wasn&#39;t busy, she happily obliged.  Excellent.  Potato, Beef and Sauerkraut w/mushroom all topped with crispy bacon and served with sour cream.  Delicious.  Dough was not thick, tough or a starch bomb. Really tender. Great fillings on all but our fave was Sauerkraut Mushroom by far. This was nothing like your frozen variety - definite homemade taste..

-Potato pancakes.  Side of two.  Thin and crispy.  Flavorful.

-Beef Stroganoff &amp; Veal Sznycel entrees.  Includes your choice of Mushroom or Chicken Noodle soup.  Mushroom soup was light and satisfying.  Full of tender mushrooms in a light cream broth.  More soupy than creamy.  Delightful.

Stroganoff is presented in a tripod kettle and includes your choice of hoof shaped dumplings, potato pancakes or pureed potatoes. We all decided on dumplings and were happy we did.
EXCELLENT.  So light &amp; tender.  Homemade perfection and a great accompaniment to the copious amounts of fork tender beef contained in a meaty flavorful sauce combined with mushrooms...Take your ladle and pour a nice helping over your dumplings and you&#39;ll be one happy eater..

I will admit, this was different from the Stroganoff&#39;s I&#39;ve had in the past and described as a beef goulash. Since I&#39;ve never had goulash and can&#39;t compare, this reminded me of a beef stew in terms of flavors and consistency - but SO tasty and well executed.  Huge serving...  

-Veal Sznycel plate was (again) enormous.  Two hefty veal portions breaded &amp; fried sitting on sautéed mushrooms topped with two sunny side up fried eggs.  Includes pureed potatoes or dumplings only. Pureed potato was simple and went nicely with this heavier dish. Veal wasn&#39;t as thin or as tender as we would&#39;ve liked and lacked seasoning. Perhaps sauce would&#39;ve added more flavor to this dish.  Although it wasn&#39;t our favorite, it wasn&#39;t bad at all.  Plate also comes with 3 Polish side salads of pickled veggies.  Talk about a ton of food for one dish!  Polish peeps know how to bring it on!

Excellent selection of Polish brews..some wines and cocktails too.  Our group felt very welcomed here. Some patrons were seated at the bar when we walked in.  Clearly Gazdy&#39;s is a go-to or favorite spot for locals, non locals and Polish alike.  Huge plus on outdoor seating as well.  Everything tastes home made and nothing lacked flavor, with the exception of veal. My only complaint would be that app&#39;s and entrees were not spaced out, but came quickly after another.  

Gazdy&#39;s serves up lumberjack size portions quite authentically -  I promise, you will not leave hungry. A family of 5 could easily feast on what we ordered and leave satisfied for only $54.
Yes, $54....that&#39;s what I call a great deal, and you can&#39;t beat the quality..

Highly recommend this Wood Dale diamond in the rough when you want authentic Polish at a tremendous value..4 types of Borsch.  Duck, rabbit, goulash, pork shank, some seafood...and more.

If you like different foods this is your place. If you love Polish food this is your place. I am a first generation Polish American with both of my parents immigrating from the mother land. I grew up with Polish food and you will not be disappointed.

1. This place is a highlander restaurant. Highlanders are considered like what rural country woods people are considered here in America. So they are the outdoorsy kind of people in Poland. So this is not the type of Polish city people kind of place. A little different tradition and culture. 
2. With that being said, the food reflects that. The food is amazing.
3. I do think the food is a little bit expensive, but for what you get its worth it. 

I do think this is one of the best Polish restaurants around. Give it a shot!

Another hour lunch, another time I was late back from lunch. Don&#39;t let that discourage you, though! The food here is incredible. I ordered a Polish standard in my family, kiszka, and I was very pleased with the flavor, texture, and moisture (those of you who have had dry kiszka know exactly what I&#39;m talking about). It came with tasty potato dumplings and sauerkraut as well. The bread they serve with an entree comes with some kind of rendered fat which is probably horrifyingly bad for you, but it is also definitely worth trying.

The setting is rustic wood like you might find in a cabin. The tables are natural wood with all the imperfections, and each table has chairs on one side and a bench on the other. It worked out great for my party of two. I really liked the look of the inside of the restaurant. It&#39;s cozy and there are only about a dozen tables, so it could fill up fast in there. There were only two tables of people when we visited just after noon. 

I docked one star for timeliness as it seemed to take quite a while to get our food ordered (I&#39;d say at least 10 minutes), and also for the check. There was only one server on, but there was an older gentleman sitting behind the counter who did zero things while we were there, just sat there letting the poor server take the brunt of the lunch crowd. The entree I ordered came with a soup--but apparently not borscht (red beet soup), which I had asked for, so I was charged an extra $3.50 for a coffee cup of borscht--not a good value--and I felt rather cheated that she didn&#39;t mention the extra cost and just upcharged me. It&#39;s not like I ordered a typically expensive item expecting it to be free. It&#39;s basically beet broth (yes, beet, not beef). Even so, I would certainly return again. 

If you are Polish and miss your family&#39;s cooking, or if you aren&#39;t Polish and want to try some great Polish food, U Gazdy is definitely the place to go."

After 10 min of explaining and even showing them my online order from my phone, I was put on the phone with what I believe to be is their owner. 

For some reason, there was an issue with them not being able to take grubhub orders and I was not the first to have tried ordering from them. Not sure why they did not settle this issue with grubhub after the first instance but even more baffling is that noone at the restaurant acknowledged it might be their system and instead insisted I was at the wrong place/did not know what I was talking about.

We started with the Pierogis. We have 5 each of the meat/pork  and potato/cheese. Both were fantastic! The meat pierogis had a bit of sauerkraut in the mix which gave the flavor a nice kick. The potato pierogies weren&#39;t quite as flavorful, but they had their own merit for being handmade. 

We ordered 3 meals for the 4 of us, so we got 2 Chicken Noodle Soups and a Vegetable Soup. The chicken was a bit lackluster. There wasn&#39;t much for flavor and it was quite bland. The veggie on the other hand was outstanding! Now, there is one vegetarian dish on the menu and it&#39;s not the soup lol! It&#39;s made with a chicken base, so it&#39;s a little salty. Between the base and the broccoli it was almost creamy. We&#39;ll have to go on another day next time so we can try another kind since I&#39;ve seen some good reviews of the soups.

The first dish that we all shared was the Pork Tenderloin Escallops. The pork was perfectly seared and covered in cheese that was bubbly and melty and topped with mushroom gravy! Who doesn&#39;t love seared pork covered in cheese and gravy?! They served it with potato dumplings that were handmade. I could have eaten a truckload of these dumplings with the gravy! NO JOKE! (we were married in a semi Polish ran banquet hall, and these dumplings were by far way better!)

The second dish we shared was the Polish Style Duck with Roasted Apples &amp; Raspberry Sauce and fries. The duck was good for the most part; however, it lost a lot of it&#39;s moisture. The apples and sauce helped. The boy is a duck fanatic and he loved it. I can&#39;t tell him he&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s just my opinion vs. his. Skip the fries if you order this. They&#39;re just steak fries. Get the potato dumplings if you can!!

The third dish we all shared was the Highlander Style Potato Pancake with Pork Goulash. I died happy eating this! I can say that I love potato pancakes from every country that has made them for me (except a few random breakfast places)! The pairing of this pancake and the pork goulash was a fantastic idea! The crispy edges of cake with all the gravy of the goulash were made to go together! I was the one that finished what was left on this plate!

This place has a great rustic, homey, almost log cabin feel to it. We had a couple different people visit our table to make sure we were doing alright. We were upset that we ate too much to attempt to have dessert! But we were glad we had some leftovers to take home! The dining area began to fill up as we were eating. We got there early, so we didn&#39;t necessarily need to have a reservation. If you plan on having a later meal though, you probably should plan ahead!"

She wanted to try some authentic Polish food and man this was the right place! It&#39;s a small, old style themed restaurant that has an old world-midevil theme to it. The food we had was spot on. I would totally recommend the sauerkraut soup if you want to try something new! It was one of the best soups I have had. The bread was also awesome and the peirogis were excellent as well. I had the roast duck for an entree and it was ok- not great. It tasted like a moist version of chicken and I wasn&#39;t really feeling the raspberry sauce that came with it.

Overall this place definitely earns it&#39;s 4/5 stars. Nothing more, nothing less. I would recommend to people that want to try authentic Polish cuisine!!"

We shared a &#34;half&#34; order of steak tartar ($8.50) which is plenty for two people to split as an appetizer.  I ordered Beef Stroganoff which come with your choice of soups as a starter.  This time of year you will often find goulash soup as one of the choices.  Oh man is it good!  It is nice and spicy and will definitely warm you up.

You can order the Beef Stroganoff with noodles, dumplings or potato pancakes.  I chose the dumplings which were a delectable treat.  The Beef Stroganoff comes in a stainless steel tureen that hangs over a lit flame.  Not only was the beef and gravy cooked to perfection, there was plenty left over for a meal the next day.

U Gazdy offers Zywiec, Carlsberg and Wehenstephaner Weis beers on tap.  A 20 or 22 oz glass is just $5 and a great value.

U Gazdy serves delicious Polish Highlander food at a great value.  Their food is delicious any time of year but, with winter approaching you owe it to yourself to check them out for a great stick-to-your-ribs meal."

If you come here you&#39;re definitely not leaving hungry as the portions are huge and the meal comes with a generous amount of side dishes. Everything here is prepared with great textures and is seasoned well. Here are my thoughts on some items:

Bread: Nice texture with a savory side of something that seems like lard and pork bits.

Soups: Chicken noodle was alright but the cream of mushroom had a nice full flavor to it with fresh mushrooms. Very enjoyable and great with the bread.

Highlander Style Pork Shanks: Pork shank was prepared well, not too salty and tender.

Rumsztyk Steak: Tenderized with a nice flavor like a tenderloin. 

Giewont Cutlet: Breading was nice with a tender cutlet inside. The ham and cheese filling was very good.

Traditional Polish Style Duck: Could be a little more flavorful but was tender and prepared well.

Hoofshaped dumplings: Light flavored and chewy, went great with entrees.

Pureed potatoes: Not very flavorful but matched quite well with the horseradish sauce.

Three polish salads: Very refreshing and fresh.

Overall, a very enjoyable meal. I am not as familiar with Polish cuisine to make detailed comments but this was delicious and inspires me to try other Polish restaurants in the area."

We took our Polish grandmother here as a surprise and she really enjoyed speaking Polish with our server, who was so very kind I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember his name.

There was a large baby shower party in the restaurant at the time so we had to wait a short time for a table but in 5 quick minutes we were seated.  Despite the large party in the restaurant our food came out quickly and the service was attentive.

We tried the pierogis (best sauerkraut &amp; mushroom ones I&#39;ve ever had!) as a starter to share.  Topped with crispy crumbled bacon with a side of sour cream they hit the spot &amp; you can choose a combo of 2 kinds on your order.  They also bring warm bread with a side of bacon drippings to slather on the bread - to those who haven&#39;t had it before it might not sound good but try it - it&#39;s delicious.  You will thank me, though your arteries may not...but it&#39;s worth a try for sure.  I do not recall the names of the 3 entrees we had but we all absolutely loved our meals.  Oh, and our meals came with a choice of soup - we all had their mushroom soup which was like a combo between a broth and  cream based soup with big slices of mushroom in it.  Oh so good!

We&#39;ll definitely be back to try some other items on the menu as there are so many delicious choices it was hard to decide."

Because we wanted to try a little of everything, we ended up ordering 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. As you would expect, waaaaay too much food. We tried the potato pancakes, pierogis, Veal szyncel, and blood sausage. Everything was great and had a lot of flavor. Turns our my daughter loves blood sausage, go figure. The beer list had some polish standards on it which were pretty decent. The only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating was that my veal was a little on the tough side."

It&#39;s charming, polite, heavy and overall an enjoyable experience. The service is not always on point, they struggle when there are crowds and the food will win no rewards, yet you still walk away satisfied. Perhaps that is because you feel like you could be transferring a cold night in Chicago for one in Poland which makes it all the more interesting.

Either at a good Irish pub, or here, at O Gazdy!  The warmth of the decor, food and staff here was almost overwhelming...I think I fell in love with all three!

The outside of this place is, well, strange and out of place looking. Something out of a brier rabbit cartoon mixed with Yosemite Sam. Wooden logged with heavy door in front and a small parking area wedged into an area where strip malls and auto stores are prevalent. After visiting though, it makes sense. The inside is clean, and abundantly wood, again. High glossed tables with benches on one side and chairs on the other. A small bar to one side that looked inviting. Seemed like all the other customers were polish...and that&#39;s a good sign. 

Our waitress was soooo cute.  First, she brought us the menus and then asked if we had been here before. After saying no as a group, she scooped them up and returned in a blink with the &#39;English&#39; versions apologizing that she&#39;d brought the wrong ones. Maybe we all looked polish, uh, maybe not!  Brought us plenty of bread through the meal and was very helpful to us while ordering. Towards the end of our visit I&#39;d basically licked my plate clean and she stopped at the table and asked, &#39;Are you done with your meal?&#39;  It was such an honest and well meaning question, but unless I intended to eat the silver then I was obviously done. It was a great example of how polite she was. 

So, onto the food. This place is a comfort food factory. Hot plates stacked with carbs and meat with no worries about eating too much or not healthy. When you are served lard with your bread you just don&#39;t think about it and dig in. Slather it on thick because it is not as strong as you think. I had the meatballs and potatoes plate.  The balls were meaty.  Like, really meaty. I don&#39;t think there was any filler in there because they were heavy. But oh so good!  Other dishes in our group were well liked, but no one got the pierogies. :(  I sopped up the remaining gravy with some of the hard bread and was ready for an afternoon nap. 

Definitely want to return soon...maybe for an evening of a few beers and pierogies."

Our waitress was great. Very attentive and sweet. Loved her accent. Even our eating neighbors were great! 

We ordered the purified, cheese and potato appetizer. Wow. 10, so many for just the two of us. Delicious.

For our entrees we had the captains cutlet which is a breaded pork loin stuffed with cheese alongside dumplings and a polish side trio salad. And the pork tenderloin scallops which is drenched is a gravy sitting on a bed of vegetables served alongside dumplings. Both delicious. Both huge. Both had leftovers that came home with us.

But, this is far from your typical Polish restaurant. Last night, I took a small party to U Gazdy, some of whom were fans of Polish food and others probably a bit more reluctant. 

I ordered the roast duck. It came with cabbage soup, some potato wedges and some chopped salads, one of which was beets. I eat most anything, but beets are my all-time least favorite food. The very attentive waiter brought out the cabbage soup and it was delicious. Then came the chopped salads, and I loved them too, even the beet salad. Finally, I dug into the roast duck -- and it was PHENOMENAL. It was crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside, with just the right amount of spices and a little apple stuffing and orange or raspberry sauce. It was not the least bit dry or greasy, two usual risks of duck. I have eaten in more than 450 restaurants in the Chicago area, and this was one of the best meals I have ever had. 

Others in the group who also had duck loved it as well. Good reports were also given on the roast trout and the goulash, along with a variety of appetizers.

The price for this meal was under $20, quite reasonable.  

The ambiance of U Gazdy is unusual, reminiscent of a rustic mountain hunting lodge. I give this restaurant my highest recommendation. It is a bit off the beaten path, and a little hard to see from the road, but it is well worth seeking out."

I had the pork shank, which was served sizzling hot on a bed of sauerkraut, along with dumplings and soup. The portions we got were gigantic!!!

The cocktails were well-made and we finished off the night with cherry cordials. 

The service team were helpful and friendly from the moment we walked in the door. Our server, Milan, was especially attentive and made the night very enjoyable.

I chose dinner here on account of these rave reviews. My initial thought that this place is built sturdy, like cottage on a cold hillside. The inside decor was similar. Classy, wooden furniture. I felt like Snow White stepping into someone&#39;s home. Everyone spoke another language, both patrons and staff. (And everyone was Polish but me until my friend arrived.)

The general appetizer is wheat bread with... herb lard. Smalec, apparently. Here&#39;s how the internets describes it: &#34;You take bacon and dice it up then heat it until melted. Pour it in a container and let it cool. the more fat the bacon has, the better the smalec.&#34; Mhm. Interesting.

I tried chicken noodle soup and yellow pea soup. I am fairly certain both from a box. In fact, I think I have this Lipton noodle at home. 

The actual cooking itself is high quality. I like the think they choose lesser cuts of meat to keep in tradition with Polish cuisine. I tried a rainbow trout stuffed with almonds, herbs and garlic butter and Rumsztyk Steak, which is apparently round steak pounded out and served with grilled onions on top. The pork shank I wanted was sold out."

Everyone loved the food, including the German and Italian diners in our party.  4 people had the Highlander potato pancake and loved it; only 1 person (a guy, I might add) could finish it.  One person had the stuffed cabbages in mushroom sauce, another had the pork tenderloin escallops and I had the Ziewont (or Giewont) cutlet.  The escallops were as might be expected - smallish slices of pork tenderloin on top of the dumpings (potatoes are an option).  The Ziewont cutlet was a softball-sized round breaded pork tenderloin inside of which was ham and melted cheese, which oozed out when you cut into the tenderloin.  Choice of potatoes or horsehoof dumplings - I had the latter. The 7th person in our party wasn&#39;t really hungry, so she had a bowl of the chicken soup and said it was good.  Everyone else started with the pickle soup, which came with dinner.  

The non-Polish people in our party loved the food just as much as the Polish people did.  Everyone left satisfied, most of us with leftovers.  I&#39;ve mentioned the pokey service before; it was a little better today.  Maybe it was because we had 6 pm reservations, and U Gazdy closed at 8?

I usually park in front, but parked in the back this time and saw the outdoor seating - picnic tables with umbrellas.  If it wasn&#39;t raining the day we were there, I would have suggested sitting there.

The only inconvenience (a minor one) was that they would only split the check in 2 - we had 7 people and wanted 5 separate checks - so everyone just paid in cash.  I thought this might be helpful to know, so you can bring cash if everyone is used to paying by credit or debit card."

I&#39;m sure when I do I&#39;ll up the amount of stars I&#39;ve given but I just can&#39;t go above 3 stars for my first time there. There are so many great things on the menu I&#39;d like to try but on my first visit my friends and I agreed to do the Highlander Dinner for four which is $69. Pork sirloin escallops baked in smoked cheese cover with a mushroom sauce, lamb served with hunter&#39;s sauce, stuffed cabbage in a mushroom sauce, potato pancakes, gypsy style fries and grilled vegetable - we figured we&#39;d get a good try of many items but I think none of us ended up ordering what we wanted most of all! My personal favorites from this large assortment was the pork sirloin. I must admit though, when they brought out the large tray of food we all OOoooo-ed and AAaaah-ed!

This seemed like a massive amount but my friends who had been here before so the portions are bigger when ordering a single dish. Everything was good but I didn&#39;t find anything particularly amazing. We also had meat pierogis which were tasty but I really wanted to try the cheese or potato cheese pierogis as well! Our meal came with a choice of soup and we all ordered Chicken Noodle which was okay but nothing too special.

As I said----I need to go back. I still have high hopes for U Gazdy although honestly my first visit was just meh. My advice to others, skip the Highlander Meal for 4 and order single dishes."

It was a cold and rainy night, 10 degress colder than it was just days before.  I absolutely needed something substantial in the comfort food vein.  Lucky for me, I deced to try U Gazdy out.  

Much of the meal here is pretty much the antithesis of &#39;healthy&#39;, but it was oh so tasty.  We were seated right away, got the house tap beer (not even attempting to spell it here)and took a couple of minutes to browse the bilingual (polish/english) menu.  One note: pay attention when everyone mentions the length of service- they do not move quickly here.  Dinner was a very leisurely engagement.  

As you&#39;ll see people mention, they serve a wonderful fresh bread here...that comes with a side of divine bacon/lard/herb spread.  Keep this in mind.  It gives you idea of what to expect.  We tried the peirogi (and they let you split an order into half meat, half potato) and they were great.  Already at this point, we had both decided we could probably subsist on a dinner of the peirogi and bread with bacon lard spread.  But we ordered entrees anyway, because why not overdo it?

I had the mushroom soup (earthy and wonderful) and Highland Shepherds special (picture: meat, wrapped in meat, wrapped in more meat (no, not kidding here)).  My sibling had the monster-sized Highlander pancake, smothered in some of the best goulash you wil ever taste with the sald trio as a side, and the chicken soup as the starter).  The chicken soup was the one average item - everything else was transcendant.  We will absolutely be coming back here, and hopefully soon."

At first, it&#39;s a bit hard to find, but if you look for a sign for a Polish grocery store, you&#39;ll see the restaurant right next to this store. When you walk in, it&#39;s kind of like you&#39;re walking into a cabin, and seating is on these big open benches.

Our waitress was really pretty and so sweet. Even though there was a bit of a language barrier and she was a vegetarian talking to a meat lover (me), she was still able to make recommendations for me.

My friend and I started with the pierogi: we chose meat and either the cheese or the potato-cheese, I can&#39;t remember. But either way, they were delicious. But the plate is huge, so I would recommend just eating a few and packing the rest of them to go so you can enjoy an entree. 

For my main dish, I got the duck, which was huge. I like that I got a big portion because it felt like it was worth the cost, but the duck was just okay. I wasn&#39;t a fan of it being bone-in because it was hard to get to the meat, but I did like that it came with apples and raspberry sauce though, so it was kind of a cool twist. I definitely want to come back and try a different dish.

Unfortunately, I can&#39;t speak too much on the authenticity of the food (If you have seen my profile picture, you will have inferred that I am not Polish), but for what it&#39;s worth , the place/food sure felt pretty authentic to me!"

The fresh bread and smalec was a great start, then went right into the fresh, homemade chicken noodle soup.  I ordered the Pork Tenderloin Escallops with dumplings.  Literally one of the best dishes I have ever had, and I consider myself somewhat of a food snob.  The mushroom gravy on this dish was so good I would have licked my plate if I wasn&#39;t in a public.  I decided to go with a piece of bread to sop up what was left on my plate.  

Service was great!  Attentive and kept a good eye on her tables.  When she asked how my meal was,I wanted to ask if I could &#34;hug the chef&#34;!

U Gazdy&#39;s decor is slightly ambivalent and so unexpected because the restaurant is essentially a dark log cabin from the exterior. However, the interior emits rays of bright light during the day reflected from beautifully intricate wood work (looks like birch wood). The bar area is completely adorned in this wood which gives it a Polish Trader Vics vibe. 

The fact that this place was absolutely packed with Eastern Europeans at 3pm on a random Saturday made my first encounter all the more surreal.

The food here is really really good. It is Polish comfort food that tastes fresh and authentic.

The pierogi were soft and pillow-like dumplings. 

They serve bread with rendered pork fat that makes butter feel like a fat-free food. 

Upon recommendation, we ordered the center cut breaded pork chop which is a very generous portion not unlike weinerschnitzel. The dish came with delicious &#34;gnocchi-like&#34; dumplings.

My wife and I were stuffed at this point, but we were pretty happy.

U Gazdy is worth a visit if you&#39;re ever in the mood or on a mission for very good Polish food. The owners are also wonderful.

Let me say that my meal was edible, but overpriced. On the other hand, my friend&#39;s food was amazing and practically a steal. I fully intend to come back and order what she had so I can give them a full five-stars.

The owner and all the employees and patrons were extremely friendly. They loved that we knew a handful of Polish phrases even though we were both clearly a couple generations removed from the old country. We loved the decor - delightfully kitsch with an abundance of wood paneling, carvings, animals hides, alcohol and cheesy 80s music. (ex. Total Eclipse of the Heart cover in English, but sung by a Polish woman with a thick accent)

On to the food portion of this tour. We were given a small loaf of bread and asked for a side of regular butter. My friend tells me they normally serve it with a side of bacon fat spread, which I&#39;ve had before and it is definitely an acquired taste. The crust was slightly hard and inside was fluffy, aka perfection. The same can be said for the creamy spinach soup. I don&#39;t know what spices were used, but it resembled vegeta/kucharek and was the perfect blend of seasoning and salt.

My main dish was a huge letdown. I still can&#39;t put my finger on it. The lamb chops were $25.50 and I expected a large portion and to be completely wowed. The size wasn&#39;t so bad for a single person, but it should have been at least half the price. Something about it tasted off. Not sure if it was the sauce, the meat, or a combination of the two. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but it hurts me to think I spent that much money and all I can say is that the presentation was beautiful and the grilled vegetables were good.

As far as I can tell, you&#39;re better off ordering a couple of the hot appetizers to make a meal. They are spot-on. And most other items on the menu seemed to be reasonably priced and done in the traditional way."

When you walk in the front door, you are immediately in front of the very small bar with maybe 10 stools.  I have not yet sat there.  Based on the proximity to the front door, I think it would be rather chilly in the winter.

Heading over to the right and towards the back is the main seating area.  Everything is made out of wood with an old fashioned, rough cut look.  Each table has a combination of chairs and bench seating.  I don&#39;t like the bench idea much because I need back support.

The staff is friendly and apparently all Polish.  Although I know a tiny bit of Polish, I have never been brave enough to try speaking it at U Gazdy.  It works out though, because they seem to understand English well enough.

The menu is filled with a good selection of traditional Polish dishes.  Since I have only been here a few times for lunch, I usually stick with the smaller things, like the U Gazdy sandwich, the kielbasa and the pierogi.  Everything is made as fresh as possible.  The pork cutlet is pounded out right after you order as told by the noise from the kitchen.  The pierogi are served freshly boiled.  This cooking style takes a bit longer, but it is worth the quality.  Don&#39;t be in a hurry if you come here.  To keep you busy while waiting, they start you off with some bread and pork lard spread.  It may not be the most healthy, but it sure is tasty!

Overall I like the fun decor and the authentic food.  I would like to come back for dinner when I can enjoy a drink with my food.  I just wonder how busy it gets.  I would definitely recommend U Gazdy for a little taste of Poland."

Everything here expresses a sincere quality, from the rustic wood interior to the snappy yet friendly staff.  The sense of cultural pride is ever-present, but never pretentious or exclusive. 
The food is superbly done and presented in various stacks, piles and mounds that appeal directly to a primal joy firmly seated in the heart of every man (and some women, I&#39;m sure). So far I&#39;ve enjoyed some roast duck with gypsy fries and some pork escallops with dumplings and mushroom sauce. Both were excellent and paired very well with my Żywiec porter. Prices are moderate considering the scope (some dishes leave you wondering if there&#39;s actually a plate under everything, or just more food).
On that note, I fully intend on taking on the Highlander Dinner (with a couple comrades, for certain) once the weather cools and I can trudge in from the wind and snow, and saddle up to a massive seemingly Flintstones-inspired pile of meat, potatoes and roasted vegetables, mug of porter in hand."

I have been here twice now. The only thing I recall from my first visit, was my entree was some stuffed pastry dish that was instantly forgetable, and that the soup I had (don&#39;t remember what) was so dern good that I ate my wife&#39;s portion and mine. 
On my second visit, I shared the duck with my wife - yuck! My plate had 3/4 gristle, fat and nasty on it, and only approximately a 1/4 meat was able to be salvaged off that bird. At $20 for the bird, is it &#39;that&#39; bird? Or is it bird in general? Not sure and I can&#39;t afford to find out. 
I admit that I am totally ignorant when it comes to polish food and unfortunately the polish in my party were not providing me much direction. I will say that the wait staff were more than accomodating on letting me try a taste, whether I was making a beer choice or trying to decide which soup to get. 
I will also give points for ethnic genuiness. This place is so genuine, that when you first walk in, you feel like the movie American Werewolf, when the two American guys get caught in the rain on the plains and step into the wolf bar (awkward) but not in a bad way. And as you settle in, you pick up on the fact that most definitely, the locals do patronize."

The food can be greasy if you aren&#39;t careful but that&#39;s how I expect sauteed onions to be cooked traditionally for instance when I&#39;m at a Polish friend&#39;s home. My buddy Chris calls it highlander cooking. I enjoyed my czerwone barszcz (red borscht) soup very much. Their version of smalec (rendered pork fat) was seasoned with garlic, herbs and other spices.

My husband and I happened upon this place on their GRAND OPENING on a snowy day a few years ago and fell in love with the owners, Betty and Shawn, and everything about the place.

The building:  first of all, U Gazdy is located next door to Helen&#39;s Deli (HELLO!) and all the gorgeous and authentic woodwork was done by owner Shawn and I think his father-in-law if I remember the story right. Ask them about the beautiful murals while you are there- they show landscaping of the Highlands of Poland, which is where their families are from. My husband and I love to sit at the bar because of the beautiful woodwork and listen to all the regulars speak Polish. We are not Polish but the servers all speak Polish and it seems to be a home away from home for many.

The food:  P.i.e.r.o.g.i.s.  AMAZING!  The meat pierogis are my favorite (with a side of bacon and its grease to pour on top if you desire - I DO) followed by the Potato and Cheese. We usually order the Pierogis with an entree.  We personally love the cutlet or potato pancake with goulash dishes.  You always know when someone is ordering a cutlet because  you hear the pounding from the kitchen into the dining room.  Authentic Hylander Polish food that tips the border on extreme comfort food!!!  

I can&#39;t even begin to tell you how much I love U Gazdy in Wood Dale for its food, people and intimate atmosphere.  If you live in city take the Milwaukee District West train and get off in Wood Dale - walk two and a half blocks west on Irving Park for a truly authentic experience!"

i had the rabbit.  it was a big chunk of leg or maybe the breast.  i&#39;ve only had rabbit from a french restaurant.  and they&#39;ve already pulled the meat from the bones.  it looks like a half piece of chicken on a plate.

Probably the worst was they served our children, without asking us, first - as in, 25 full minutes before our meal was served. Yes, you read that right. This is not a place I expect to have a 2 hour meal, esp when we arrive for dinner with the elderly in-laws, at 5pm.  Our kids were bouncing off the walls while we tried, in vain, to get anyone, anyone at all, to refill a water glass. Our kids had been finished for 15 minutes when our food finally arrived. I&#39;d have asked for it sooner but we couldn&#39;t find anyone, much less our waitress, to ask.  My dinner was almost wholly incorrect, vegetables prepared incorrectly, salad never came.  No one to complain to, the dishes were dropped and person who brought them (not server), scooted away.

I ordered a BBQ beef sandwich and fries. This sandwich was very good. I really liked the sauce. It had a bit of a kick to it. Very, very tasty. The fries were great as well. 

My son chose the nachos. Those nachos looked really good too!

I&#39;m going back sometime to try a burger, the chicken, and a good &#39;ol Italian beef sandwich with mozzarella (on garlic bread if they have it). LOL

I was with my friends the day they placed the order. It was quick and super simple (after we ate lunch, they walked up to the counter and ordered. Super easy). On the day if the party, they picked the food up and it was still hot when they arrived back at the house.

If the cashier hates it that much, maybe she should find a job elsewhere.

Their chicken soup is decent albeit a little on the salty side, but it&#39;s good on a cold night or if you&#39;re feeling under the weather.

It looks nicely seasoned with herbs and cut up lemons, but it stopped there. After 1 bite I needed to add some salt just to add flavor. I ordered to potatoes as a side and rice as an extra side, both were good and tasty, unlike the chicken.

Ordered the gyros for my husband and rather disappointed once more. My husband is a big fan of the souvlaki and had high hopes for their gyros, but was let down. The meat was dry and rubbery. Whomp whomp....

I&#39;m a big fan of a few other hot dog/burger/gyro/beef/cheesesteak places in the area, so I think what kept me from trying this place sooner was simply that I was happy with some of the other places. That said, I think I have found yet another place to get my fix! I had the burger with everything, and was really happy with the fact that the toppings were fresh. They use a nice thick cut of tomato, and fresh lettuce, so the burger feels like something you would make at home and take your time making it well. The fries, while better than Downtown Dogs, are not quite at the level of Dante&#39;s (now Johnny D&#39;s). They&#39;re still very good though, with a thicker cut, and these too were obviously fresh from the fryer, as they were almost too hot to eat for a while after I got them. 

In all, it&#39;s safe to say that I&#39;ve added Chubby&#39;s to my list of places to head to when I&#39;m in the mood for some burgers and fries."

Last visit, ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. Very well done, and hot! Fresh lettuce and tomato. Fries hot and fresh - not too much salt, which you can always add.

In a town full of chain restaurants Chubby&#39;s offers an oasis of good food.  I usually get the Cheesy Beef with hot peppers but my other favorites are of course the gyros and the bacon cheeseburger.  

For dinner I usually get the souvlaki or chicken kabob.  The quality of the souvlaki and kabobs will rival any that you will find in Greektown...and I should know because I went to school at UIC.  Tender, flavorful and seasoned just right....it melts in your mouth.

My friend&#39;s 4 year old daughter gets the Grilled Cheese meal each time we go there.  She loves that it comes with fries, drink,  a pickle  and ice cream.  She also gets a kick each time the owners call her cutie. As we walked out of the restaurant on our last visit she said &#34;this place is the best restaurant we&#39;ve ever been to&#34;.  

I spent 4 years working in marketing with Wendy&#39;s founder Dave Thomas.  He had a passion for making sure his employees treated customers like family and for serving the finest, freshest food he could.  As we traveled the country shooting commercials we would stop in at local restaurants to see what we could learn from other restauranteurs.  Most of the time he would point out all the things they were doing wrong.  But Chubby&#39;s is the kind of place where  Dave would have commended the owners on the quality of their food and their outstanding service.  

Thanks for setting yourselves apart from many of the other dining choices in Algonquin."

All of us refuse to go into this restaurant ever again.  I was sharing my awful experience one day and was shocked to hear that they had equally bad experiences with rude owner and his wife.   There is a common theme among our complaints. They cannot seem to get an order right and when they make a mistake they go to great lengths to humiliate you and make you think it is your fault.  I had three such bad instances before I decided I&#39;ll never  step foot in the place again. The last incident was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. During a prior visit they had forgotten the cucumber sauce for my gyros and because I was in a hurry I did not travel back the 7 miles when I realized it was missing  I call the restaurant and the male owner first tried to convince me that I was crazy and then he finally said that I should mention that next time I was in and he would give me an extra sauce. I gave him my name and I returned only a week later and I reminded him when I place the order that he forgot the sauce last time and that he said he would give me an extra one this time. Well he started lecturing me about wanting to get stuff for free and being dishonest and wanting to bankrupt his restaurant.... For a small container of size that probably cost him about 5 cents. Well that five cents that he argued about has cost him probably about a hundred dollars a month in business that I used to give him. I am over 50 and and in my entire life have never met a business owner like this before. There are other good choices in the area and only someone who fell desperate should even consider this place. For the few of you who wonder why the bad reviews: it sounds like you may have gone into the restaurants occasionally and got lucky on the one time but trust me if you go regularly like I used to go you will start to know the nastiness of the owners and realize that service and courtesy to Customer is far more important than the food Anderson quality is just so so anyway quite frankly. I have to snicker when I look at the help wanted signs every month go up and down every month. Having known someone who worked there it sounds like they are equally nasty to their employees too and can&#39;t keep them around either

They were so bad, in fact, that my husband and I couldn&#39;t finish them. We threw them out and went to Big Sammy&#39;s instead.

My school was doing a dine and share fundraiser, so I figured I&#39;d give Chubby&#39;s a try. The service was fine, but the food was not. The chicken gyros are a joke. The meat has a strange, rubbery texture (it&#39;s not actual chicken breast; it&#39;s some kind of pressed meat) and is dry as shoe leather. The pita is ice cold. The toppings, such as they are, consist of a small amount of wilted, brown-around-the-edges shredded iceberg lettuce and one tiny (and I do mean tiny) slice of under-ripe tomato, cut in half. No onions, no cucumber, no feta cheese. For sauce, they gave me a small cup of honey mustard salad dressing. Really? For a gyro? 

My husband got the actual gyro, which he said was awful (and it had the same limp lettuce and tomato slice as mine did). His did have gyro sauce, but not much of it, not enough to render the dried-out, chewy gyro meat edible.

The fries were OK -- I&#39;ll give them that. The onion rings were just average, with kind of a soggy texture and not much flavor. 

Perhaps there are other menu items this restaurant does better, like hamburgers or hot dogs, but given the fact that a Greek-style fast food place can&#39;t even do a gyro properly, I don&#39;t feel inclined to head back to Chubby&#39;s anytime soon."

---------------
I finally made it back to Chubby&#39;s and had the Souvlaki again.  This time it was just as delicious as the first time and I experienced **no illness**.  I am sure the problem I had the first time was an unusual occurrence.  I told a friend of mine about how the owner apologized and she&#39;s been a regular for over a year.  Thumb&#39;s up on Chubby&#39;s Gyros!!!

Update #3:
---------------
Have to say I am impressed again.  The owner called me to give a sincere and heartfelt apology for  treating me the way she did which I accepted.  The illness I felt was not severe and not different than what I have experienced at many other restaurants.  I will give them another try, order the same thing and see if it happens again.

Update #2:
---------------
Now I double and triple apologize!  I was trying to be nice by bringing the problem to the owner&#39;s attention and just got **chewed out** by the owner!  I was nice, I complimented the food, I told her I did not want a refund; that I was just trying to help.  UNBELIEVABLE!

Update #1:
---------------
Ok, folks, my apologies.  It tasted great going in, but now I am not feeling well (one hour later).  Someone needs to call the health inspector - they definitely have a problem over there.  If you ever decide to eat at Chubby&#39;s, wait 24 hours before writing your review.  

This is my original review:
------------------------------------

We live one mile from Chubby&#39;s so I&#39;ve always wanted to stop in.  I finally did, today, and have to say, I was very impressed!  

First off, the decor is quite nice considering the place has a fairly typical Greek-style fast food menu.  You could even have a business meeting here.  

Second, the ordering staff was friendly, but what I really liked is they have someone watching the tables and bringing the food out.  He even went back for napkins and silverware and was very friendly.

I tried the Souvlaki sandwich.  It is pieces of char broiled seasoned pork with lemon juice and tzatziki (cucumber) sauce on the side, served on a grilled pita.  It was fantastic!  The reason I liked it so much is that the pork is very moist and tender.  Sure, it&#39;s not pork tenderloin (not at the $5.50 price of the sandwich), but whatever they did to it was just right to make it tender and juicy.  

I really don&#39;t understand the complaints in the other reviews because I find it very hard to believe the Chubbies I experienced today is the same Chubbies described in the older reviews.  I will go back in the future and try some of the items people complained about to get to the bottom of it. 

If you live in Algonquin or happen to visit, give Chubbies a try.  It is the only gyro place around here, so it&#39;s worth giving them a chance."

DH had the souvlaki - the pork was nicely done (not overdone) - came with a fantastic cucumber sauce and he chose roasted potatoes. He REALLY enjoyed it.

I had the philly steak sandwich and onion rings. Onion Rings were great - nice beer batter. The philly was near perfect. It was fairly wet (juices from the onions and peppers) and not dry. Camewith a copious amount of cheese - really good.

We also got chocolate cake and a brownie. Haven&#39;t tried them yet - waiting for some room

My boyfriend works right down the street from there so I go there to buy him and myself lunch.  The food is good, except I didn&#39;t care too much for the pasta salad.  It is the only thing I have eaten from there that tasted like it came from a school cafeteria.  Other than that, I really like the food.  I usually get the patty melt and it is always cooked to perfection.  I was insanely impressed last night when they made what was probably the best mushroom swiss burger I&#39;ve ever eaten.  I&#39;ve never had trouble with the service, but the woman who works at the window always seems like she doesn&#39;t want to be there.  She doesn&#39;t give off a good vibe.  On the contrary, the man who works the drive-thru is always nice.  If I ever experience any issues with the customer service, I will probably never go back, but for right now I will keep enjoying Chubby&#39;s."

It&#39;s close to our house, and we would have liked a go to place with a menu like theirs.  They don&#39;t serve a true Chicago style hot dog....no poppyseed buns.  Their Gyros were just barely ok.  The onions were not cut right for a true Gyros.  The tomatoes were fair.  The Pita was not heated and seasoned correctly.  One of my family members got quite ill a few hours later.  This was the first, and last, time we go there."

My husband ordered the Italian sausage sandwich, which he is very picky about. I ordered the souvlaki sandwich and our son had the fried chicken sandwich. My husband said his Italian sausage was excellent (and it was!) My souvlaki was also extremely tasty, an abundance of tender, lemony pork on a grilled pita wih a side of tzatziki. As another poster said it was deliciously seasoned, cooked beautifully and very tender. My son&#39;s chicken was also really good, not greasy, well seasoned.
Not sure where Brandon ate, but it couldn&#39;t have been here. Also not sure what his big problem was with the box of fries saying freshly cut. Nowhere on the menu does it claim the fries are anything other than fries. The restaurant was clean, well-maintained and the service was fine.

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more things, especially the gyros. Great gyros are sorely lacking in this area. I&#39;m not a fan of Kostas which is pretty much the only gyro option, and driving to Skippys in South Elgin is a bit of a hike."

Both types of gyros meats were fresh and good and grilled as they should have been, not that too soft crap that far too many raw meat eaters like. The pitas were fresh and toasted. The restaurant was very clean and the staff friendly.   We wish them well and we plan to eat there again. Good to have another place to eat close to home.

Cannolis and subs are made fresh to order... bread is crusty and flavorful... roasted potatoes are bursting with flavors from peppers and oils.. I could go on and on.

The location is pretty much terrible (no thanks to the crappy Sonic), but it always seems to stay busy.  There isn&#39;t a ton of room to sit down, but there is also outside seating when it comes to the warmer months in the burbs.

Enter Franco&#39;s!

I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s called, but my mother in law came home with the largest sandwich I have EVER seen in my life!  Craziness!!  My son got the baked mostaccioli, and my daughter got a slice of pepperoni pizza (NOTE: this &#34;slice&#34; is as big as an entire styrofoam takeout container!!!!!)  

I had a slice of sausage pizza, and it was awesome!!  It was ginormous, and it had the proper ratio of sauce to bread to cheese.  Totally delightful.

My MIL&#39;s huge sandwich was tasty as well, but I really couldn&#39;t get enough of my pizza to be honest!

My son&#39;s baked mostoccioli was really big as well, and so tasty!  I love when you take a forkful, and the stringy cheese comes with it.  YUM!!!

Because the customers I encountered here were so very nice and helpful.  I was standing in front of the wall menu/counter trying to decide what to order and several customers made sure that I had a number ticket so I wouldn&#39;t be overlooked when it came time to order.  AND each time I have entered or left Franco&#39;s when I have visited, some customer always opens the door for me.  Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve always had the little boy with me, or maybe because they see how heavy the baby carrier is, or maybe there&#39;s something about Franco&#39;s that makes everyone warm and fuzzy. 

I guess it goes to show the kind of people Franco&#39;s attracts.  This restaurant/deli/bakery certainly has a family feel to it.  The folks behind the counter have always been cheerful and ready to help. So perhaps their friendliness is contagious?  

But friendliness can only go so far to make me a return visitor...and the food passes that test.  I&#39;ve dined in and taken food to-go several times now and each time has been a good visit.  I love their marinara sauce, great fresh tomato flavor with just a tiny bit of zing. Their meatballs are also well-made and tasty.  The Pasta Fagioli is filling and really warms you up on a cold day.  Do not overlook their pastry case--it&#39;s kind of hard not to as everything looks perfectly made. I love their eclairs, cookies and tiramisu.  

This place is busy during lunch hours, probably because of the great lunch deals.

I had never been there so we decided to go.  When you first walk in there are wonderful looking pastries, and butter cookies...I looooove butter cookies.  Couldn&#39;t help myself and bought a pound and a half, some for home, some to share at work.  Each of the cookies, and other baked goods were well made and very appealing.  I enjoyed a cookie later they were delicious.  After tearing myself from the baked goods my friends and I ordered various items for lunch.  Everything was fresh, delicious and the prices reasonable.  The owner greeted us and was very down to earth and personable.  The young man behind the counter who helped me decide what to order was helpful, friendly and did not hurry me when I was asking questions about the various selections.  Though I live a good half hour away, I will definitely be back, and bring friends and family with me. I can&#39;t wait to try more of their cuisine. What a jewel found off the beaten path."

It&#39;s well kept, the people are friendly, and although I have not had the baked goods or coffee, they look delicious. But I would rather go almost anywhere else for lunch because the food I have had has not been awesome. 

Have you ever supported the Cub Scouts by going to one of their dinners held at a local church or whatever? And then you get there and they have spaghetti or mostacciolli or hot roast beef sandwiches, and after the first bite you say &#34;Nope. Not worth the money or the support&#34; because the beef tastes like a bar of iron and the noodles are overcooled and flavorless and everything is greasy and needs a good hit of salt? And the salad is kind of &#34;staple&#34; and the dressing is not knocking your socks off? Have you ever had that experience? Well I have. And I&#39;m reminded of it every time I go to Franco&#39;s. 

Franco&#39;s is a a small restaurant, inexplicably (in my opinion) loved by all that is located just behind the Sonic off of Barrington Road sort of near an industrial complex. The restaurant is kind of ordinary- neither a hole in the wall, nor atmospheric in any way, but it&#39;s clean and well kept. Again, the employees are friendly, and the food portions are generous. It is mostly a busy place, at least it has been busy every time I have gone with the people at work for lunch. Sadly, in the three times I have gone, it has only ever disappointed me. I would rather have a deli sandwich from Mariano&#39;s up the street or Italian from almost any other Italian restaurant instead, (save Olive Garden). Honestly though, every time I am there, I just wish I was across the street at El Rodeo eating what may well be the finest tacos in all of Chicagoland (I am prepared to admit fault with this assessment upon tasting better tacos in the area). Perhaps I need to speak up more when my co-workers drag me along for lunch. 

By my observations, if you like this place, you will love it. Otherwise, like me, you&#39;ll be kind of unimpressed and wish you could walk away from your work friends and go eat elsewhere. Either way, good luck."

Once a month I like to treat myself to the Italian focaccia sandwich but honestly, they are either skimping on the ingredients or using cheaper products. I just don&#39;t like the taste/flavor of it anymore.

Maybe it&#39;s my taste ? but it seems their red sauce has no flavor or spices at all. The Chicken vesivio and chicken parm is very thin piece of chciken breast that is dry and no flavor, most Italian restaurants serve both these dishes with the bone in or boneless.

The baked goods are especially excellent. Worth the trip just for the crusty breads. Italian cookie selection like momma never used to make.

I have lived in Schaumburg for 10 years and discovered this by accident one day almost 10 years ago (its behind Sonic which at the time was Petco).  Its sort of hidden back there but so glad we found this little &#34;hidden gem&#34;!  My family and I have tried the Italian sausage, pizza, the frozen soups (yum), the bread and OF COURSE PASTRIES!  My favorite is their famous sticks which are filled with apple, chocolate, cherries, lemon, nutella and more!  I love that this is a quaint little Italian place, its family owned, I met Franco and he is the sweetest man, you want to just hug him and call him nonno!  John, his son is wonderful.  he made us a big cannoli for the holidays one year and my family kept calling it the HOLY CANNOLI and they posted pics on facebook (they were impressed).  Give it a try if you have a party, I ordered it twice for Christmas and for my kids graduation.   I love the authentic Italian food, I know its made fresh daily and they cook non-stop.   Being authentic Italian myself (born in bari) I only like biscottis and cappuccino for breakfast so what I really go in for now is 14 biscotti&#39;s (7 plain and 7 almond), as soon as I walk in the staff knows what I want since I go in every sunday like clockwork and order the same exact thing :)
Needless to say I have loved coming here,  I like the little dining area and the espresso and the friendly employees and I loved it so much my daughter now works there :)

Their hot food is also hit or miss.  I do love the sandwiches on focaccia bread.  The italian beef sandwiches are done just right.

I love the deli / bakery concept it reminds me of the local neighborhood shops growing up in Chicago. Do you like fresh baked bread?  Pick up a Ciambotta or a 16&#34; Focaccia. You get the freshest homemade fix-ens at a reasonable price and the staff working the counter is top notch. A great experience both times I have tried them.

I only have 2 gripes with the place.  First, they stopped making sfogliatelle.  WTF?!?!  They were great.  If the staff reads this, please consider making them one day a week, for those of us who know what real Italian pastries are.

Normally we do the food, cake and cannoli. This time the beef was provided by a family member and we did chicken and sausage and peppers from Mariano&#39;s. So we ordered the cannoli shells and 2 cakes - (2 different events going on.) The girl read my order back and it was correct. We paid for it. She also informed me they didn&#39;t provide the Barbie doll for the top of the cake.
My daughter went to pick up the cake and got it home. No room for a Barbie doll or the alcohol bottles. So they said, &#34;Bring it back we&#39;ll fix it.&#34; No compensation for the return drive 1 hr before the party. They did fix it, but the left off the roses . WTF? 
So when it comes time to cut the cake, the fillings were wrong!!! It was too late at this point as they were closed. So the next morning we called and spoke with someone. He apologized and said that it was put in the computer that way. Not our fault. But he did offer a 2 $10 gift certificates - no expiration date &#34;so if it takes you awhile to come back they won&#39;t expire.&#34; 
Now here is the really funny part,  later on in the day, when we had leftovers, my son cuts into the cake and discovers that the one has the correct filling on only half of the cake. So they cut into the other side of the other cake and its correct there. Why would they make half of each cake the opposite of what it should be? Well we will probably use the gift certificates for the cannoli - you can&#39;t mess that up. But we will be done much to my sadness. We&#39;ve used them for almost all of my childrens events. This was the last graduation, however I have a grandson now and there are many other places that offer catering. Wish things could have turned out better, but $20 for a $95 order doesn&#39;t cut it."

It is a dive like other reviews said but who cares if the food is good?  It was pretty empty (maybe because it&#39;s located in a relatively quiet part of town).  The service was good...no complaints there.

I ordered a crazy roll and a rainbow dragon roll.  The crazy roll came in 5 or 6 pieces and the rainbow dragon was closer to 10 pieces.  It was definitely way too much food for me but I was being greedy and wanted to try both rolls.  I wasn&#39;t disappointed with either.  The fish was fresh and the seaweed wasn&#39;t chewy so I could actually take a bite out of each piece without it falling apart.

Everything on my plate tasted great.

I picked up a salmon teriyaki meal, and I was sort of in a hurry, so I took it to go. Even after the 10-minute drive, I&#39;m pleased to report that the teriyaki lunch was excellent.

The rice was still perfectly clumpy and cooked, while the vegetables were excellently seasoned and and very well cooked. The browning on the edges was great, and all of it was pleasingly tender.

The salmon was also nicely cooked; half perfectly, half a tad over, but nothing unrecoverable. I also was a huge fan of the teriyaki sauce, which a perfect balance of a little bit sweet and a little bit salt."

I took one of my friends in the area here to enjoy some of their lunch specials. My friend isn&#39;t a huge fan of raw fish (she&#39;s crazy) so she ordered the teriyaki beef lunch special instead. She was really happy with it, she didn&#39;t even share any with me because she ate it all so fast D: Good sign though right?

My chirashi don was delicious. Nice thick slices of tuna, salmon, yellow tail, super white tuna, etc. I definitely recommend checking this place out for lunch or dinner! Sitting at the bar is the best, sometimes towards the end of the evening you can have a beer with Santo haha :)"

I looked at their menu and immediately knew it was. It an authentic place because who puts beef on their sushi? And jalapeños? 

I ordered the volcanoe roll that had crab and yum yum sauce. The name is falsely advertised as it did not blow my mouth with yummy flavors and the crab was not real crab. 

The atmosphere was great and the the people were friendly. The tuna and salmon did taste fresh though."

And everything was very tasty. Some of the maki was overpriced for what you got, basically all the ones for 12.95 + While the more basic rolls were cheaper than most other sushi places. Service was average. My complaint is that all the rolls I received, weren&#39;t rolled enough to overlap the seaweed, and had a gap, where everytime I picked one up all the insides fell out... I also noticed the seaweed flavor stood out. I am not a sushi expert, but I know at other sushi places I rarely taste the seaweed, which I prefer."

Over time, I&#39;ve seen businesses in this strip mall like Boston Market and Blockbuster go out of business. I&#39;m happy to report, Sushi Asahi remains strong. It helps that this Japanese restaurant serves food until 10pm every day but Sunday (closed).

This place is a bit out of my way; however, when Jason and I are in the area visiting my sister and her family, we are always delighted to stop in for Japanese appetizers and sushi.

The service was fantastic, but I was not all that impressed with the sushi. I am a sushi addict, so I am known to be a bit picky. 

I enjoy the raw sushi. I ordered the Philly and crazy rolls. Both of these were good and nice portions. The cucumber salad that they give you was super yummy and the miso soup was ok. I prefer mine with green onion and a little more tofu and seaweed. The overall taste was good tough. Also the hot tea was really good. 

So what is the problem you ask? My mom only certain maki rolls usually the ones that are deep fried. The new asahi roll was terrible. I think that if your roll is named after the restaurant it should be pretty dang good. The roll was burnt and dry. The roll was deep fries so long that the fish inside was over cooked. The amount of fish in the roll was pretty weak as well. I could not even palate it. And I never waste food. 

So if you come here stick to the raw stuff. It is much better. Also the dining area is very small and crowded."

However, by the end of our meal it was packed. Service was very nice throughout the meal and the food was A-OK but nothing blew me away and I didn&#39;t find anything great.

We started off with Age-Dashi Tofu $5 as I had been having a craving for a while. It was a solid Agadashi Tofu, well made and well flavored. We were brought out a cucumber salad  with bits of crab in it which was pretty yummy, as well. 

We went with three rolls all of which were presented beautifully and well made. The Philadelphia roll ($7) was very good, but it can&#39;t claim the honor of being the best Philly roll I&#39;ve ever had. We also got the Hawaiian Roll ($13) with spicy tuna topped with fresh tuna &amp; sesame sauce. I didn&#39;t like this roll one bit. The sesame sauce on top was not good &amp; had a very strange consistency to it. Without it, this may have been a decent roll but there was too much of it and I couldn&#39;t get through it. If you look at my picture you can tell the sauce doesn&#39;t look too appealing. Also, it said spicy tuna and I really didn&#39;t get much spice at all. I&#39;m a weaksauce when it comes to spice so that&#39;s really saying something. We also got the Godzilla Roll ($14) which has fried eel, cream cheese and what they call yum yum (imitation crab) wrapped in soy paper topped with avocado. This roll was definitely the best of the bunch and I surprised myself by liking it so much! Although this was the tastiest roll, it was the loosest in terms of how it was rolled. It didn&#39;t stay together quite as well as the other two rolls.

We ended our meal with red bean &amp; green tea ice cream both of which tasted a bit off. I had the red bean which was off but still edible. Being my favorite ice cream, I finished the dish. My friend&#39;s green tea tasted so strange though that he didn&#39;t even touch it after a couple of bites. A previous review mentioned the ice cream is $6...Well it&#39;s $3.50 now and you get quite a big dish. But skip it.

In the end, a decent meal but I&#39;m sad to say it wasn&#39;t enough to draw me back a second time."

While the strip mall around it is dying a slow death it seems this place is still a good draw.  Atmosphere is not high end but not every restaurant has to be Japonais. As in any sushi place some rolls are better than others and that is a matter of taste but overall the fish seems fresh.

They even have special greetings for certain people and will give them a big hello and goodbye when they are there.  Chat with everyone like they have known them for years.

Their hot tea is perfect Japanese style, they give you a light cucumber salad, and sushi can be made however you want it, all you need to do is ask and they will make it happen.

The seared mackerel is one of the more unique dishes you can order here (or Sushi Kushi Toyo or Crazy Buffet II) that is probably worth a visit to try (may not fit everyone&#39;s tastes though).

There is nothing great either. It&#39;s so-so. The joint is a on the small side (again, nothing wrong with small place or being in a strip mall, we are here to chat about the food goods, no?) 

We got the spicy salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, spider roll, fire bird, and something off their &#34;special&#34; menu. (I forgot, sorry) They all taste the way they should, spicy, crunchy, etc...but all the rolls had one thing in common: the rice was far too smushy. It&#39;s hard to eat large rolls when the rice is that texture. Also, I am a uber salmon fan, and there were almost no RARE salmon rolls. There were several cooked salmon rolls, however.  I am fairly sure there is a reason for that: the salmon is not very good here and tastes a bit fishy. Duh, I know it&#39;s supposed to taste like fish, but fishy in a bad way, you know? The spicy salmon roll is actually not on the menu, but we ordered it so we can compare apples to apples in sushi places. Oddly enough, there were fish eggs in our spicy salmon but not in the spicy tuna? So, come here for other fish, but not the salmon! 

Service was ok, atmosphere was homey, but they didn&#39;t ask us if we wanted dessert or not, so I can&#39;t write a review on the sweets here."

dinner is tad bit pricey with larger portion.

Service was very good, the surroundings were, ah, &#34;basic&#34;.  But at the end of the day, the reason you go to a mid-range restaurant is for the food.

We started with the miso soup, which was very good, and the iced tea actually tasted like tea and not tea-flavored water -- so a good start.  The complimentary little cucumber salad was OK.

We then had the tuna tartare, which had a recommendation from another reviewer.  The tartare itself was quite good, but the chips were pita chips right out of the fryer (still hot and practically dripping oil).  They would do well to bake their ships or dry them off or something, because grease just doesn&#39;t go well with sushi generally.

We then had two maki rolls - the &#34;firebird&#34; (spicy tuna with sweet sauce topped w/fried shrimp roll) and the &#34;dream roll&#34; (yellowtail, radish w/wasabi mayo, tempura and tobiko).  So, a big tuna night.  My wife and I both agreed that we liked the taste of the firebird better and the texture of the dream roll better, but unfortunately we didn&#39;t get good texture and good taste in the same roll.  As another reviewer mentioned, we also found the rice to be a bit mushy.

We didn&#39;t have dessert, but we did take advantage of the coupons on their website (15% off a meal over $30 right now) -- if you go make sure to check their site for coupons.

Maybe the other rolls are superior, but after we walked out neither of us was inclined to go back and see.  With Sun Shui, Tokio Sake, Naomi Sushi and others that are not that far away, there are too many other options we don&#39;t have to roll the dice with."

I&#39;m shocked this place is still open. The sushi is NOTHING special.  I also asked for an Uni shooter. They said they don&#39;t have it on the menu but they&#39;ll try. I asked for 1.. they brought me 2 of their attempts. I had reminded the waitress that I only wanted 1 and they don&#39;t look like shooters. She checked with the manager and said no problem and told me to have the 2 it will be taken care of. LIARS!! Not only was it not what I ordered, they charged me $9 for EACH. Wildfish which is an upscale amazing sushi restaurant only charges $6. Then, the manager said there&#39;s nothing he can do, that&#39;s their prices, and since I ordered something I was responsible for paying for it. Then, the icing on the cake was they refused my Restaurant.com certificate... which I had placed on the table once we sat down. SOOOOO  irritated with this place... I would NEVER EVER go back!

It&#39;s nice to see a little experimentation with either fruit or different sauces.  Most of the rolls offered on the menu had tempura or spicy mayo.  I prefer to try and stay away from the heavier rolls.  All of the rolls that I ordered were very good and the fish was very fresh.

The salad that came with the meal is not your typical Japanese dressing, IT WAS BETTER and the BEST that we&#39;ve had. Susan said it had more mayo? She&#39;s Japanese, lived in Japan and worked in Sakura in Mt Prospect, I&#39;m a moron so I&#39;ll go with what she says, ha. We ordered the seaweed salad appetizer, we both thought it was VERY VERY good. Table service was a little slow, maybe it was because the D-10  SABA (amed broiled mackerel) $11.95 is grilled and according to their menu starts out from raw. Susan is used to this being grilled well-done but this one wasn&#39;t. She said it was good but the meat from the mackerel was flaky instead of being firm. My 
AS-10   SASHIMI DELUXE(18 pieces sashimi) $23.95 had nice large pieces on top of small balls of rice, well prepared. It seemed that the sashimi was toweled dry. All in all it was a solid 4 stars for me. We will probably return (with a coupon) in a couple of months."

You know the difference between a broth that tastes store bought and the one where it tastes home-made?

Stopped in here recently for some sushi and decided it up with some nigiri and maki types. The nigiri were great, featuring extra generous portions of fish of marvelous quality.

Also the maki options are so grandiose it was difficult choosing which to try! The ones we chose (actually I can&#39;t remember the names.. one with spicy crab and one with spicy tuna) were excellent. Repeat visits are necessary simply to try all the yummy sounding maki combos. 

Next time I would also like to try the udon and yakisoba to see how those measure up to other places I&#39;ve tried. Beware of the gyoza... they are yummy but tiny!! Good to whet the appetite though, and the slightly charred outside was mmm...

Love the staff! As my date and I were contemplating dessert (Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s is right. there.) the waitress offered us a taste of the fried bananas--gratis! Oh yes, we shall return."

My husband and I randomly decided to go in one day a few years back, and I have been hooked ever since.  I agree with other reviews that seeing a sushi place in a strip mall with only a few open stores is not the greatest first impression.  But once you go in, the staff is incredibly friendly and the sushi is amazing!  I order take-out almost every week and it is always delicious.  My favorite rolls are the Alaskan Roll, Boston Roll, and the Yum-Yum Roll (spicy crab that lives up to its name, YUM!).  I love that the rolls have a good amount of fish in them.  It might be slightly more expensive than other sushi places in the area, but the quality makes it worth every penny.  Even my best friend from Chicago will come out to the burbs to eat here.

I gotta say, so far I think it&#39;s very good. I ordered carry out for a late dinner, the wait staff was pleasant and speedy. The menu was filled with all of what you would expect and some unexpected stuff, especially the entrees. I went with one of my newer favorites, the spider roll. It was very good, but truth be told I have yet to have a truly bad one yet. The lobster roll was very good as well. It had a hint of wasabi, which I&#39;m not a huge fan of , but I still liked it. Last but not least, I tried the spicy tuna with avocado, which I think was one of the better I&#39;ve had.

We ordered adegashi tofu which was perfectly fried, not oily at all and with the perfect flavor. We ordered 4 maki rolls, 2 of them were OK (crazy roll and rainbow roll), but I was quite impressed by the Hawaiian  and caterpillar.

I&#39;ve lived in Palatine for three years now and have never tried this place. I finally stopped by on one of my few lunch breaks and ordered food to take back to work with me. I was starved, so I ordered alot. While I waited, I noticed signs for specials on the wall that were some crazy, eclectic makis that I wish I saw before, but I&#39;ll have to save that for another day. The service was very friendly and quick-my order was ready much faster than they said it was going to be. 
I started with the chicken teriyaki lunch special that came with miso soup and salad. The chicken was a little dry on the outside and the texture was close to tofu. The rice was nice and sticky and the veggies were steamed yet still crisp. The miso soup was ok, I&#39;ve never been a miso connoisseur- I just slurp it down. The salad was ok and the dressing was a ginger and maybe peanut mix, I liked it. 
On to the sushi: 
I ordered the Yum-Yum roll (spicy crab) and the Spider roll. These were some FRESH rolls! The Yum-Yum pieces all held their shape, but when you put them in your mouth, they melted into this wonderful bite. I&#39;m surprised this roll was only $5.50 considering this doesn&#39;t taste like imitation crab. 
And for the piece de resistance: the Spider roll-this is the most interesting spider roll I&#39;ve ever eaten. There&#39;s not only fried soft shell crab in here, oh no, there&#39;s also fish egg and lettuce (?) as well. Now, I&#39;m totally down with the fish egg, but the lettuce was strange to see in it and I wouldn&#39;t even have noticed if wasn&#39;t sticking out as much as the crab&#39;s legs were. 
Everything got my approval, but I can&#39;t believe I ate the whole thing. Now I&#39;m drowsy and full and wanting a nap. unfortunately, I&#39;m still at work so I&#39;ll have to wait until later. I&#39;m so stuffed I&#39;d say &#34;I&#39;m never eating again&#34;....but who am I kidding?"

Recently, they had a change in management. Before, I knew that I could choose any Sunday and Cynthia and Sandy would be there. These two waitresses are amazing! They do a great job at making sure that everything is okay. The recent change in management has really changed things. They recently made it so that Cynthia and Sandy would be working brunch every other Sunday. I don&#39;t just go to brunch for the food, I go because I love talking to Cynthia and Sandy. My family does not go to brunch if they are not there. With this new rule, we have to call ahead and ask if Cynthia and Sandy will be there. If they are not going to be there, then we don&#39;t go to brunch. 

I have also noticed a decline in the food recently. Creme brûlée is not made with banana pudding. The past couple of times that I have been there, it has been made with the banana pudding. It&#39;s disgusting.

I wish I would have checked Yelp before my husband and I decided to drop one hundred and thirty seven dollars here last night plus tip. I left feeling rotten about myself for having spent that much on one of the worst entrees I&#39;ve probably ever had at what&#39;s supposedly a nice place.

The app we had (sesame tuna, something that barely has to be cooked, pretty hard to mess up) and soups were all pretty good. The $8.50 glass of Pinot blanc I had tasted like the bottle had been open for a day or two. Not great. We had to ask our server to bring us bread with the soups. Asked for market prices on King crab and cold water lobster tail and they were beyond ridiculous. I can hardly believe that&#39;s &#34;Market Price&#34; so we passed. Got the warm water lobster tail which I&#39;ve had at other places in the past and enjoyed. When this thing came out it LOOKED awesome. I was so excited and didn&#39;t mind the little extra we were spending. Then I took a bite. This thing was literally inedible. It seemed not only over cooked, but horrible quality. I could hardly chew it and it has absolutely zero flavor. Im a big foodie but I literally lost my appetite after trying to eat it. Ugh. I was so disappointed and my husband felt bad so he let me have his fish trio which was also pretty dry and not wonderful, but a bit better than the lobster. The sides it came with were some mushy vegetables and baked potato that tasted like it had been sitting cooked for 2 days then reheated. They don&#39;t even include a dinner salad for the ridiculous prices they charge for mediocre quality food. The waitress had to have seen we were visibly upset and only asked how we were doing once and that was before I had even taken a bite of anything. She was nice, just not very observant or else didn&#39;t have the guts to inquire why we had completely traded entrees. I used to be a server so I&#39;m not one to make a big fuss or try to send back a fifty dollar plate of food, but I also know as a server it&#39;s my responsibility to make sure my guests are happy. The bus boy was nice and kept our waters full, so kudos to him. 

I will not be returning to this place. I&#39;m not sure how it stays open. Do yourself a favor and go to Shaws."

On every occasion i have been here, the food has been amazing (though expensive)and service has been friendly. The only issue i have run into here was that the bar can get VERY noisy, even at lunch time. If you are looking for an intimate dinner for two, I recommend trying to avoid being seated near the bar for that reason. This is a great restaurant, and *most* of the food is worth the cost.

The soup trio is a must for any soup and seafood lover. The appetizer provides small servings of their three best selling soups : conch chowder, lobster bisque, and clam chowder. The seafood buffet every Friday is also delicious, but very expensive ($40 per person)."

It would be nice if they updated their website to say as much. Interior is old, musty, and not very clean. Hostess was nice, but our waiter could not answer some very basic questions about the menu. Ordered the lobster roll and after some questioning, found out that the lobster was &#34;lobster spread&#34; and may not even contain real lobster -- certainly, it wasn&#39;t fresh lobster. We paid for our drinks and left without ordering. Will not return."

They give you complimentary champagne unlimited refills. The feel of this restaurant is very Pacific Northwest. I felt as though I was dining in a restaurant in Seattle. The quality of the food was decent. The staff was very friendly. They have additional parking in a lot down the street if their main lot is full. Overall it was a good experience I would come again.

The fettuccini Alfredo has imitation crab in it so that&#39;s kinda gross. The clams are really chewy, and the mussels are small and shriveled.

Holy S#%T is all I can say. I&#39;ve worked in restaurants for over 10 years and for the life of me I can not understand how they would charge $90 for that food. Maybe years ago when I went YES- but now? It&#39;s like an Old Country Buffet with a coy pond. Our server was great upstairs- nice woman with really short blonde hair, solo singing the happy birthday song to her guests- which is cute- thankfully she was there to fill my champagne glass pretty frequently because I definitely tried to drink $90 dollars worth of it so I didn&#39;t have to eat too much -the buffet? Shrimp had a funny taste to them- the crab legs I didn&#39;t even try because they were small and unappetizing looking, the quality of everything, right down to the strange sausage link i bit into was not up to par- the desserts weren&#39;t good- it&#39;s so sad because I really wanted it to be what I remember and it just wasn&#39;t. R.I.P Port Edward- I don&#39;t see this place standing on two legs very long without a serious overhaul. Btw I loved the vintage 1950&#39;s blue toilets."

I messaged the management via yelp before going inquiring about reservations. She promptly replied back saying one was not needed.. this was impressive.  Typically I never get a response back via yelp. 

Arrived and was promptly seated outside next to the water. Dannie was my server and ahe was awesome.  However, even though I knew the prime rib was the special she never brought that to my attention.  But thats ok. She wasnt too familiar with the menu items but I already knew what I was getting so thats ok. She always had my hendrix and tonic refilled.

The food and drinks.. the tonic was a bit flat which was ok bc I like tasting the hendrix but some may not like this.  I ordered peal and eat shrimp (1/2 lb) and it was chilled but not that cold.. they were good but shoulda been a bit colder. I ordered prime rib med rare and an add on 8oz tail. The tail was good as well as the sides. The prime rib was iver cooked more medium that medium rare but it was still good.

Overall,  I enjoyed my visit and would more than likely return. Management seems to carw hwre thats a plus in my book.

I would recommend educating staff on  menu items and prices and make sure steaks arw cooked as ordered.  But like I said it was still satisfying."

Boyfriend and I had the window seat and it was perfect.  The food however was not the best seafood we have had but it was good. Tried their crab cake appetizer because it was half off appetizers when we went. Got two crab cakes which tasted fresh.. then we ordered their peeled shrimp which were tiny but came with plenty and waiter was nice enough to tell us if we didn&#39;t mind peeling the shrimp that was the better deal. I went with the soup trio for $7.00 as my main meal which was neat.. got 3 soups their clam chowder.. yum.. conch.. yum (brothy and light which was nice) and their soup de jour which was a beef barley... also yummy! Boyfriend had their lobster bisque and he said it was good. We will come back it is close and I love the ambiance of the restaurant will be nice in the summer.

Let me start off by saying that I SERVE AND BARTEND so, I am not a huge fan of yelp, but I find it necessary for this location. 

We visited Port Edwards on the Sunday of the Founder&#39;s Day festival. There was no longer seating on the patio, which was told to us by the hostesses that are a bit too immature for this establishment. Their demeanor was rude and they seemed very overwhelmed (staff accordingly?) 

We then moved inside to the upstairs bar area so that we could still see the fireworks through the window. Remember how I said I am a server? And that I hate when people over exaggerate time frames, quality, etc. on yelp reviews? Well, I am not. We literally sat at the bar for 15 minutes without having someone even greet us. They just kept serving everyone around us. The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because of the sweet, older lady behind the bar (there were multiple bar tenders). 

We ordered the shrimp appetizer and it was okay. But the prices are not worth the experience or quality of service. I am extremely disappointed."

They greet you nicely at the door/walk you to your table at your pace/timely service/good food for the price/you just enjoy the evening?  Well this is not one of those restaurants!
Went there Sunday eve as GF&#39;s parents wanted to go for seafood and we drove there from Schaumburg.  Should have gone to Shaw&#39;s.  Walk in the door and the first question out of the young girl was &#34;Do you have a reservation?&#34;  Not good evening, thanks for coming to our place, etc.  Then she kind of runs to the table on the middle level but the GF&#39;s parents are in their 80&#39;s--too fast.  After a couple of minutes we get water--that was good but it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come by--and you&#39;d think she was on a track meet she tried so fast to rush everybody.  I saw she was waiting on tables all around the place--she just couldn&#39;t cover that much ground.  On this Sunday it was about 90 degrees outside with high humidity and the inside of Port Edward was about 75---way too warm.
Food--I got Red Snapper but you can take the &#34;Fresh&#34; out of the menu description--I&#39;ve had better from Costco.  Rice pilaf cold, beans overdone. Parents ordered desert which they didn&#39;t finish--first time I&#39;ve every seen that.  Way too much chocolate in the Tiramisu. I know the bill was over  $140.00 which was terrible for that quality.  They have signs stating they are the #1 seafood restaurant in McHenry count but there can&#39;t be many others if they win all the time. 
Too many good restaurants in the area to return to this place."

Unfortunately for the price the quality is not there. For starters we ordered shrimp cocktail way over cooked shrimp and not fresh. The crab cakes tasted like canned crab and very dry. The clam chowder was to thin and nothing in it. Then for the entrée I ordered one of there specials sliced filet with asparagus, artichokes, crab meat and a sauce on top. They gave me jarred artichokes. Really those should be fresh. Asparagus was tough and filet was flavorless. My husband had a filet and crab legs. The crab legs had a odd taste. They were not fresh.

Our food was decent without setting the world on fire (we skipped on the buffet). We started with oysters that were really good. I had the mahi mahi that was decent, veggies on the side overcooked. My wife the Hemmingway fish that she liked. The kiddos shared the fish and chips that they devoured. The ice cream also a hit with the kids meal. The accompanying bread was stale and should not bother serving. Pricing all very reasonable and some interesting beer selections. What brought it all undone was our matronly judgmental server who snatched the knife out of one year olds hand. I mean really what harm could be done? It would not have even cut the stale bread. At the end of the day no one cares for our child more than we do. To double down some goose from the kitchen walked by and pointed at our one year old playing with a teaspoon and gestured in panic. Our server said &#39;I know I have already taken a knife away&#39;. Stick to serving and not judging. I guess when the average age of the diners is 65 it must be hard to handle a young family."

I guess the thin slice of pineapple is what made it Hawaiin. The dipping sauce was necessary to add any moisture. Green beans and carrots were not seasoned and most likely frozen. If rating just food it would be 2 stars.

Sitting outside along the river on a gorgeous dinner night was pleasant. The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  Then it got dark and the staff offered umbrella lights, which fit around the post, to most tables.  They did not have enough lights to provide to all tables. About 6 occupied tables remained in the dark."

It&#39;s a little pricey if you don&#39;t eat the seafood or steak. We love the crab legs, the unlimited champagne, and the variety of choices. We&#39;ve always been accommodated by calling ahead to see if we could get in. Sometimes the servers make you feel rushed, but its usually a good experience."
port-edward-algonquin-2,Fred M.,0tiR-Xnv8P61Oz0JhctdXQ,"Grayslake, IL",0,1,0,9,1,Jzfp6-Zh4U862MFbZqCqFQ,4.0,2015-06-22,"This review is only for Sunday Brunch.  $35 for all you can eat and bottomless champaign.  This might be the largest Sunday buffet in Chicagoland.  We&#39;ve been coming here since I was a child, (so there might be a slight biased/nostalgic element to my 4-star rating).  

Port Edwards offers lots of seafood including: crab legs, shrimp, jambalaya, crayfish étouffée, 2 soups and several other offerings.  The carving station typically has turkey, and one other meat (this past week the beef had outstanding flavor). Adjacent to the carving station is usually dressing, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  Another section of the buffet has typical breakfast fare including an omelette station and an eggs Benedict station.  There is also a section with an enormous variety of desserts (including a chocolate fountain for dipping fruit).  

The service is always very attentive and constantly filling the glasses (champaign, water, etc).  

With such a large selection of food negative people will find food to gripe about.  To that point I personally think the creme brûlée is lacking, (but I&#39;m a bit of a creme brûlée geek).   Likewise positive people will find plenty of food rave about - The eggs Benedict is eggcellent, and I love the crayfish étouffée.

Overall, I recommend going here because they have something for everyone, and good service."

Walking in the restaurant had a strange, disjointed feel with little nooks and crannies and lots of levels and staircases that just came off as confusing. 

We approached the hostess and she asked if I had a reservation, which I did not have and she snipped back that a reservation is usually required but she&#39;d see what she could do. She then showed us to a remote far away back room set pretty far away from the buffet, and what I jokingly thought of as &#39;the room for the poor saps who don&#39;t have a reservation&#39;.

The buffet itself was fairly extensive with pretty much anything you could imagine and it all looked really fresh and fully stocked - however the layout was once again on all sorts of different levels and tucked in little corners which made the traffic flow very awkward. Even the plates (which were tucked away in a weird cabinet type thing) were hard to find. 

The food itself was pretty good over all. Some things were a little bit cold but it&#39;s really hard to keep that much food consistently hot and nothing was ridiculously cold. The London broil at the carving station was delicious.  

The brunch included champagne which I guess is a nice touch, if you like champagne which I just don&#39;t. 

I would never have paid the $74 for brunch for two people if we hadn&#39;t had the gift card. It just doesn&#39;t sit well with me to pay that kind of money for breakfast. So, this was most likely a one shot deal for me at Port Edward. It was good but nothing about the place makes me want to go back."

I like it though...it is like being in a old ship with a huge Koi pond in the middle. I found the service to be friendly and nice (not upscale but down home friendly).

The oysters were ok, a couple made me kind of wonder if they were safe to eat. I love good raw oysters and in Chicago you can get some good ones....not as good as coastal cities like Boston, Seattle or Portland. I am just trying to paint a picture that I have eaten good seafood.  These were middle America scary....made you wonder if you were rolling the dice. So I try to be upbeat and say &#34;Ok, oysters aren&#39;t their thing&#34;. We split their Crab legs (2 pounds) which came with side salad and a baked potato.  The salad was very good....the potato they give you melted butter liquid substance like they give you for the crab legs. The crab legs were dungeoness crab legs and HUGE. So out of those two pounds, you got like 4-5 half legs. Just huge crab legs! We both started eating....the crab legs tasted off..... I don&#39;t know what was up with them. They tasted old and fishy! We both love crab legs but neither of us could finish these. So very disappointed! So I had two beers, girlfriend has a glass of wine, a dozen oysters which were below $20, and some old tasting fishy crab legs. I got the bill it was $176. This is good Chicago restaurant prices.......so so disappointed. I will not return!

Crawfish ettouffe is terrific. The Eggs Benedict are great. Nice omelette bar. The carver station is great. There are a number of types of smoked fish and you can set yourself up with lox and bagels too. The desserts are good, and there are a ton of choices. 

The thing that makes the place for me beyond the massive selection of food is the fact that it is such a throwback. I don&#39;t think anything has changed in years. Your kids will love the koi pond. The waitstaff is dressed in a nautical theme. It seems like the place could have been featured in an Episode of Sponge Bob. If you have a good sense of humor and sense of nostalgia, you&#39;ll love it. If not, you should probably go someplace else. 

The final thing to note is that for brunch at least, the service is superior. Your champagne glass will never be empty. Same with water.

I&#39;m a breakfastier. A pioneer of breakfast places, dishes &amp; recipes if you will.

Coffee? Yes! 
Fresh squeezed OJ? Please! 
Omelette station? Even better!!
Mimosas, crab legs, prime rib and dessert bar? Um, hell yeah!

Yes it&#39;s a little pricey, about $35 per person, but this is a beautifully set up brunch and worth the price. 

We went for my birthday celebration. We got there right when they opened at 9:30am because we didn&#39;t have a reservation. Our party of 5 was sat immediately in the main room. 

We all loved different parts of the brunch... Waffles with fresh fruit whipped cream and pudding was my favorite. I had some fun at the omelette station and seafood bar. I shot crab leg water in my mans face when I snapped a leg open! Whoopsie! 

They continuously filled our champagne glasses, which I generously deposited into my fresh OJ, for mimosas! After several return trips for more chocolate covered strawberries, we explored the restaurant, which has a pond with sailboat (inside), wine cellar, gift shop and huge outdoor patio that overlooks the Fox River. (I&#39;ll be hittin that patio for dinner &amp; drinks soon!)

After dinner we took a walk in the park along the river, because it was gorgeous, but mainly to stretch our bloated bellies! Don&#39;t judge! I don&#39;t eat like this every Sunday, it was my B-Day! 

Definitely try the Eggs Benedict, seafood paella, waffles with toppings, crab legs, dark chocolate covered strawberries, bread pudding, pecan pie &amp; the white chocolate fountain! YUM! Excuse me while I clean up the drool off my iPhone.

Our waitress was very personable and gave us a 50% coupon for next brunch because she heard my mom mention they used to go there years ago. NOTE: the coupon was for 50% off ONE brunch... Not a whole brunch bill. Still very nice."

It was snowing so there weren&#39;t many people in the restaurant. As we were seated we noticed a piece of paper on our table that read something like, &#34;For parties of 4 or less, please limit your dining time to 90 minutes or less.&#34; Our snippy waitress took our drink order and didn&#39;t mention the specials that night. We ordered a salad and Oysters Rockefeller for appetizers. The oysters were the size of dimes but the dish had good flavor. The blue cheese on my salad had a very sour taste and smell. I asked the waitress to bring me another cup. She said that blue cheese always smells bad. I agreed but said that this was not fresh. When she came back she put the cup of blue cheese under my nose and said, &#34;Does this smell better to you?&#34;. I told her it would be fine and thanked her. We ordered the filet and lobster tail for $90 and took our sweet time eating. Our entree tasted good and overall, we were happy with the taste of our food but for $90 there should have been sides included. Everything is a la cart.

My husband and I ordered the Oysters Rockefeller, they&#39;re unique and not as good as Bob Chins. We also order the crab legs, which were very good for the location and type of restaurant. 
I was extremely disappointed to see that they allow people to smoke on the patio next to other diners who are eating and may have children. This seems incredibly outdated to me...I have yet to sit on a Chicago patio where people are allowed to smoke next to people who are eating ( I mean just gross!). 
Port Edwards, please get with the times. Ask your diners who smoke to go to a designated area away from other diners and children. It&#39;s really not that big of a request."

It was a mix of highs and not so highs. First off, I love the look of the place. Is it a tad old? Yes, but that is part of the charm. You can feel the history in the place and I like that. I am sick of these bare boned high tech places that are opening all over. This was a refreshing change.

As for the food, well, I had the 1 1/2 pound Maine lobster special. It was wonderful. It came with boiled red taters and mixed fresh veggies. I loved everything about it. Christopher, who does not eat seafood, ordered the meatloaf sandwich, and I knew it was a mistake before he said it because very few places make good meatloaf and I assumed a seafood restaurant would be no different. Well, he did not care for it. He really should have ordered something else. On the other hand, making good meatloaf isn&#39;t that hard, so there you have it.

I had a Margarita. They were on special and it was pretty darn good. The view of the river was wonderful. All in all, I had a great lunch, Christopher did not.

Have to mention the ladies room. They provide various toiletries, including mouth wash. How cool is that? Yes, very cool."

First of all let me say that the service was excellent! We sat by the river and the decor was perfect. 
We are there Saturday April 4th at 6:15pm.
We ordered calamari and requested it grilled (oil instead of butter), and the server offered to have it cooked in white wine and garlic, which sounded delicious. When it arrived the calamari was floating in some liquid and tasted as though it&#39;d been boiled with no grill marks or any seasoning at all besides the wine and garlic. Even a pinch of salt would have been good. Do they get all their flavor from butter and not know how to make something flavorful without it? 
They left the calamari on the bill even though we sent it back - this is horrendous customer service. Because of this we will never return. Had they comped the appetizer or had a manager come over to the table we might consider it... but the rest of the meal continued a downward spiral anyway... so maybe not. 
For our entrees we we got two entrees with the intention to share. He ordered the Hawaiian Ribeye and I the 8oz Lobster tail. He had garlic mashed potatoes (that direly lacked in seasoning - again even a pinch of salt would have greatly helped) I had boiled potatoes and both entrees came with mixed veggies (again plain as hell)... and I ordered a side of the best asparagus I&#39;ve ever had - absolutely perfectly crisp with nice char marks and cooked perfectly through. The steak and lobster were a whole different story. The steak was medium to medium well when ordered medium rare. Yuck! The lobster was well over-cooked - tough and hard as if it&#39;s been microwaved. My husband couldn&#39;t even eat his half - but I had already eaten my half of the steak so he wasn&#39;t even satiated. 
We left wanting to stop at another restaurant still hungry and desperately wanting to redeem ourselves from such an awful culinary experience. 
The menu was great with plenty of yummy-sounding appetizers and side dishes to choose from and they offered many delicious cocktails. It seems a bit archaic though to be charging $4-5 extra for &#34;premium&#34; side items (like any other veggies beside potatoes) and not allowing any substitutions. 
All restaurants should be well prepared to cook alternatively for people with food sensitivities these days - to make grilled versions of their food that have zest, and pop with flavor even though they don&#39;t have dairy or butter (and gluten free options as well - which they may have had but we didn&#39;t ask). 
Servers should ALWAYS ask specifically about the steak being cooked to the proper doneness. 
Lobster shouldn&#39;t be brought to the table that looks like it&#39;s hard and tough. 
This was entirely too much money wasted. It was so disappointing to pay SO much money and walk away without feeling good about what we spent it on. Upscale pricing absolutely requires upscale eating and Port Edward&#39;s just misses the mark. 
Stay away, far away.

Entrees. I didn&#39;t like the sauce that came with the the coconut shrimp and although I felt it bad manners I got kethup and that helped. Really I think red lobster is better and cheaper.

We went for Mother&#39;s Day brunch on Sunday and had a fairly positive experience. We had made reservations and when we checked in, we ended up being seated upstairs. My grandparents had forgot to mention we needed a downstairs table to accommodate their disabilities. The staff was very kind and got us seated downstairs in approximately 15 minutes. The buffet was very well-stocked, and everything was hot and fresh! I am very thankful for the staff who worked so hard yesterday to make it a nice experience. 

For the breakfast side, there was an omelet bar, eggs benedict, waffles, bacon, and blintzes. Kind of slim pickings, but to be fair, our reservations were at 3pm, so it was practically dinner at that point. There were also cheese plates, lox, and assorted cold fish. I had the eggs benedict, some cheese, and waffles to start, as well as some lox. I love the lox here! So delicious! The waffles were a little burnt, but not very hot, as the butter did not melt on them. I really liked the eggs benedict, hot and fresh! The lunch/dinner side was much preferable. There were cold salads, deviled eggs, paella, shrimp and rice, clams casino, a raw seafood bar, and a carving station. I had some of the turkey from the carving station and noticed they were out of stuffing. I stood and waited about five minutes and they still hadn&#39;t brought any out! One of the kitchen staff noticed I was waiting and told me they would bring some fresh stuffing to my table as it came out. I thought this was very nice, and they brought me a large helping. The turkey and gravy was excellent, and so was the macaroni and cheese. I had peel n eat shrimp from the raw bar, delicious! I sampled some of the crab legs from my brother&#39;s plate, and they were kind of dinky and didn&#39;t have a lot of meat. Desserts were okay, chocolate covered strawberries, a chocolate fountain, chocolate mousse, creme brulee. The creme brulee hadn&#39;t set properly before they torched it, so it was very runny. The mousse was good, as were the strawberries. 

I am giving it four stars because the seafood did not impress me as much, which is upsetting for a seafood place. But the staff really saved it with their accommodating manner and excellent customer service. The carving station was delicious and everything on the buffet was fresh. I would return."

I will say the fish varieties I tried were absolutely delicious. Well then I got to the crab legs which is what I really went there for in the first place, all I can say is I have never in my life had a crab leg that tasted bad. Well not until Friday night, I would say one out of every 3 cluster was good the others had a mus hie rotten taste to them. I did mention this to are waitress and her reply was I was not the only one to mention this tonight. My wife who hates sea food order a prime rib meal asked for it to be coked med rare. Well it was well done, yes not any pink in the steak what so ever. I told her to ask for another one but she is the type that will never send any thing back in fear of the cooks doing something nasty to her food. 
Unfortunately I am sadden to say I wont be going to Port Edward any longer as the food quality is really not worth the price you are paying. I have been to better sea food buffets for the price tag of around 15.99 which were just as good if not better."

I made reservations for Easter brunch a month in advance. I knew on the day of he brunch there would be a little wait. Instead, we had to wait an hour for our table to be ready. When I heard them finally call my name, I went up to the stand and the lady at the reception stand was extremely rude and said I already called your name twice and now I have to wait longer for them to find a table. I told the lady that was standing over by the water because there were no other places to stand. Finally when they found a table, she told us the only one available was in their lounge. In order to get to the buffet from the lounge, we would have had to walk through the mass of people waiting for their tables every time we would have gotten another plate of food. At this time, we decided to leave. It wasn&#39;t worth it the trouble. I recommend not going here on any special occasions."

Unfortunately the vast majority think they know how everything should be when they are clues about how food should be prepared, priced and served. They are also clueless as to how much restaurant help are paid and would not work for this pay if offered.

Port Edward has been around awhile circa late 1940&#39;s. Ed Wall wick is one of the best traveled Restauranteur in the country. He is well respected among his piers
and known for his generosity. Throughout the years of his operation he has traveled all over the world to get the most unique gifts in his store and is a fantastic place to go if you have someone special in mind.

His Brunch is known all over the Fox Valley and in the suburbs of Chicago as being one of the most complete. Many times our family over a period of 50 years have come here, because nothing else come close to the choices offered here. Prices?
Go to comparable re4stuarants and then compare their prices to Port Edward to make a fair comparison.

If you are in the restaurant business, over 50 years, you are doing something very right or the &#34;Market&#34; will shut you down~! When I said my family had been going here for over 50 years, that&#39;s the finest thing I could say."

But- I digress. This restaurant is one of those oldies that has been in an area FOREVER and was a BIG DEAL back in the day but has not adapted-- with staff and service and thus is backsliding. Just my opinion. Years back (5+ or more) I&#39;d go here with my then boyfriend (who soon became my ex-husband but that&#39;s an entirely different story)-- the bar has FANTASTIC Bloody Mary&#39;s and fun bartenders. The view- by the water- outstanding. But-- the service -- well that&#39;s the killer. They don&#39;t have great service. They get ridiculously busy for buffet nights and there is no sense of urgency with customer service. One of the last times we went here- we had 10 people for a Friday night seafood buffet. We all had cocktails and 8 people ordered the buffet and two just wanted soup or salad. So-- I say this to reference, we had a solid check total going and I believe the tip is added in -- they actually came to our table and loudly yelled at my MOM for taking a bite of my salad because &#34;she didn&#39;t order the buffet&#34;. Having worked in restaurants myself for YEARS-- I know that freeloading cheapasses can come in to a buffet, order WATER and then one buffet and no one else orders and they think they can share. I get it- as a restaurant owner you&#39;d be annoyed. But TEN PEOPLE with cocktails and 8 buffet orders plus 2 individual food orders-- we aren&#39;t freeloading. And even if we ordered 10 meals vs. buffet, guess what my mom would take a damn bite of my salad. The server was relentless. I asked to speak to a manager thinking they&#39;d be sensible-- nope. She&#39;s like YOU CANNOT SHARE A BUFFET. MORON. I then wrote to the owner/manager after the visit and they wrote back very confrontational- &#34; Our video cameras showed your mother taking a bite of your salad, we should have billed you an extra buffet serving!&#34; -- FAIL. Absolutely clueless."

So yeah, the place is old, pricey, a little outdated as far as interior decorations go, and has spider webs on the outside of the windows. 

But really, what do you expect? 

Port Edwards is a local legend for the Barrington Hill-ers. That old couple sitting at the corner of the bar has probably been claiming those two seats for 40 years now... and that bartender serving them? Yep, she knows their names, their favorite food, how long they&#39;ve been married, their kid&#39;s names, their kids&#39; kid&#39;s names, etc. It&#39;s THAT kind of place. 

Drinks lack consistency, but it makes it fun. First glass tastes like juice with a splash of liquor; the second is liquor with a splash of juice. The salmon is good ($25), the grouper sammie is blehh ($12), the steak sliders are delicious ($16). Oh! And that crab spread that comes with the bread is SO GOOD. 

The food isn&#39;t exactly what you&#39;d expect for the price you&#39;re paying, but it&#39;s really not about the food here. It&#39;s about the atmosphere, the ambiance, the tradition.

They&#39;ve got a guy on guitar serenading the restaurant on certain days. There&#39;s outdoor seating along the river, so you can watch all the rich folk pull up to the restaurant in their boats. Tables are filled with 3 generations of families. It&#39;s cute. 

It&#39;s about the experience. Sit back and enjoy the traditions of Port Edward&#39;s."

My husband and I have been loyal Port Edward&#39;s customers for the past 14 years. It has been our go-to special place for Valentine&#39;s Day and our anniversary. 

Although some may agree that the place is a bit outdated, we have enjoyed the unique atmosphere PE has offered over the years.

The price is always hard to swallow, however, we treat ourselves to a big Port Edward&#39;s dinner because we genuinely enjoy(ED) the food. My husband always ordered the 2lbs of King Crab Legs and I always ordered the Filet and King Crab (Dejonge Crust on the filet). The dinner never has disappointed us. My steak was always so flavorful and the King Crab was always delicious and sweet.

In the years past, they would have single roses available for purchase on V-day and one year they had a package where you could purchase a rose &amp; a fresh water pearl necklace. I thought that was such a unique idea and added a little something special for Valentine&#39;s Day.

This last Valentine&#39;s Day we made our traditional reservations. For some reason I wanted to look up reviews on Port Edward&#39;s. My search led me to here. I was quite shocked to see that there were some pretty bad reviews of one of my favorite places. I saw that people were stating that there is now a charge for a salad (there never used to be). I tried not to take too much merit in some of the other minor complaints because everyone has their own personal taste in food.

On our way to the restaurant, I told my husband of the bad reviews I saw and we just chalked it up to a difference in opinions. 

We waited a few mins after our reservation time and were seated way in the back of the resturant. A server came to take our drink order. After she left, we noticed the menu was completely different from what we remembered. Change can be good, however we were so dissapointed to see my favorite dish was no longer offered. Then my husband looked for his King Crab. It was $109.99! I am fully capable of understanding Market Prices, but come on. We have bought King Crab to prepare at home and 2lbs of King Crab is not $100. 

The server came back to take our order, however my husband wasn&#39;t ready because he had no idea what to even order now. Our server went to go help a wedding reception group nearby. We literally waited about 15 mins because she came back to take our order. I was pretty irritated that they didn&#39;t have specific (&amp; extra) staff to take care of the large wedding group, rather than have servers for tables go to serve cake. 

I ordered the Lobster Edwardo. (Beer battered lobster tail medallions w/Galley fries which was $65). I got 3 medallions which were good sized. The galley fries were disappointing, I literally got 5 small dime-sized potato pieces. Fresh green beans were served with the entree and I did appreciate that they were fresh not frozen or canned. The lobster medallions were unfortunately over-cooked. The meat was so dry and so rubbery. I had to chew so many times to be able to get it down. My husband&#39;s scallops were ok, but he was disappointed by the serving size for the price we were paying.We opted out of the salad(since it&#39;s now a charge) and drank water to keep the price down.

I really didn&#39;t have the opportunity to bring it to the server&#39;s attention. All the servers were so busy with this wedding group and another large group that we rarely saw them. She seemed overwelmed and not in good spirits. I am always reluctant to complain about food or ask to have something else prepared for the fear of servers or kitchen staff doing something to the food behind closed doors. (We&#39;ve seen it happen).

We tipped the server 20% even though it took 15 mins to get our order taken. I feel that on a busy day like Valentine&#39;s Day and having two large groups, management should have had specific staff serving those two parties. Other diners shouldn&#39;t get ignored because of large parties.

$100 later we were ready to go. We&#39;re so sad that it changed so much. That has always been our special place. I&#39;m sad to say we&#39;ll probably won&#39;t go back."

The fact that it was your most successful brunch is only because of lack of options and the fact we are coming out of a recession. All the area restaurants are up in sales.  Please post a sign on the entrance door to let your patrons know they are on camera. Its the law and it was not there when we walked in. Not one person spoke to any of the children I saw having a field day at the buffets. Since it is being filmed, all the more reason it should have been managed better. You know its your busiest day, no excuse not to have more staff, ample supplies, un-bent forks, claw crackers, etc... friendly front desk who greets you with a smile and thanks you for coming...  51 years, you should be a pro by now?

We sat at the bar to have a cocktail and asked the bartender to notify the server when we were ready to be seated, we waited 20 minutes no server, went back to the bar and told them we need a server. In the meantime the table was set for 4 people, there was 2 of us and there was a dead small spider on my husbands bread plate. The server came and told us that we could  not have been waiting that long, this is fine dining or it used to be. I ordered the King Crab Legs my favorite and as always asked them to split them, I was told that the kitchen was too busy at $60 a pound I dont think so but the server told me she could do it. The Lobster Bisque was great as well as the Ceasar salad. My husbands Shrimp De Jonghe was fair and luke warm, price the same, size and portion smaller, baked potato poor quality vegetables hard. My King Crab appeared   I watched the server stab them on a basic brown bar tray on a stand I wondered if it was clean? it should of been done out of sight, the tray was not removed so pieces of crab remained. The Crab was cold in spots. Since we were going to the bar for a nightcap I asked the server to wrap up the crab and keep it in a fridge for me she told me that if it was left in the kitchen it would prob. disappear I asked if the bartender could put it in the fridge instead of handling it for me she gave me my leftovers and the nice bartender put them in the fridge. What is happening with this place is the owner not managing it anymore? My family has been going their for 40 years and it always exceeded our expectations.We always made the trek from Saint Charles and told Friends that they must go there, we cant really suggest this place anymore its not worth making the drive when we have other fine dinning spots locally which have their act together."

Food: Overpriced &amp; bland. Honestly, red lobster does seafood better (and I HATE chains).

Atmosphere: tacky. The restaurant is in serious need of updating, from the Menu to the Bathrooms.  The uniforms are lame as heck. Please do your business (and servers) a favor and just stick with solid black outfits. The sailor outfits scream &#34;kid&#39;s restaurant&#34;, and for the price IT SHOULDN&#39;T BE.

Service: Cold, rushed and unwelcoming

I am so disappointed in this place. I use to love it, so when we had friends visiting, we thought &#34;Let&#39;s take them to PE. That&#39;s a nice place for out of town guests&#34;, but times are changing and that means PORT EDWARDS should change, too. Our guest&#39;s drink was spilled onto the table, soiling the table top, with no offer to clean the mess. It really set the tone for the evening. Everything else changed my view of PE

PE needs to turn the tacky, outdated decor into a modern, classy fine dining place for today."

Aside from the wonderful food, there is a very nice bar with huge bay windows overlooking the Fox River.  They also have a small boat inside the restaurant that sits on a little water that is very special for an anniversary or very important date.  After dinner in Summer you can take a boat ride on the Fox as a very nice ending.

(yes, I know that is one word, but our experience requires emphasis).  I am so sad when I think about what Port Edward used to be.  I hadn&#39;t been there in a few years (maybe 8 or 9), and had promised my husband a great dinner experience.  

We began with a couple of drinks, one of which strongly resembled Lysol, and which I sent back.  Our waitress&#39; comment was that she doesn&#39;t like the sour mix they serve.  (Nope, it didn&#39;t get removed from the check, nor was I offered a replacement on the house...)  The other mixed drink was incorrectly garnished, despite ordering it specifically.  Strike one.

I remembered the crab cakes being excellent, so requested them as an appetizer without looking at the menu.  They were no longer excellent - now passable - and the appetizer portion consisted of two cakes, each about 3&#34; in diameter, for $15.00.  Strike two.

At this point, I checked another restaurant we know to be awesome, to see if we could get a table.  We could.  But we were too chicken to just pay for the drinks and appetizer and dash, so we stayed.  Our bad.

The hubs wanted steak and king crab legs, and no such combos were spelled out on the menu, so he inquired as to the price to add on a crab leg.  One crab leg, $29.99.  With the addition, his NY strip and one crab leg would have been a $63 entree.  REALLY!?  Strike three.

Our server strongly steered us toward the dinner buffet.  We took a look at the offerings, and decided to go with it, in the interest of getting done and out of the place.  Dishes I tried from the buffet were overly seasoned and/or sauced, and nothing stood out as being worthy of taking seconds.  The hubs asked for crab legs and was handed a heaping plate of them; at least this gave the experience a little value.  The crab was so-so.  The paella that was strongly recommended by our waitress contained chicken on the bone and shell-on, tail-on shrimp (how does one eat that neatly??)  Strike four.

It was incredibly hot and stuffy in the area where we were seated.  When I overheard another diner complain to the waitress, I chimed in and agreed that it was really uncomfortable.  The response?  Loved this...&#34;well, at least you don&#39;t have to wear THIS!!&#34;...motioning to her sea-captain uniform top.  REALLY!?  I&#39;d think even just watching a few movies would give the average idiot a basic understanding of professionalism when working tables at a restaurant that tries to appear classy.  Strike five.

Filing this one in the yep-should-have-believed-the-recent-crappy-reviews category.  $150 later, that is...."

This place is way too crowded and overbooked.   We had to wait 45 minutes past our reservation time in an overcrowded lobby with zero seating.    Even the tables are stuffed together to make room for more people.   
Lines to get in, lines to get a plate, lines to get your food, lines to get back to your table.   It just doesn&#39;t end.
Food OK at best.   There was 6-7 feet of empty space on the buffet. 
Overpriced.   $35 for adults with empty space on the buffet????
Drinks are not included in that $35 !!!
What REALLY gets me is the included gratuity.    I understand that gratuity is added for parties of 8 or more but keep in mind that THIS IS A BUFFET.   The server is only bringing drinks.   Her added tip was $80.00 !!!!!   Just for bringing drinks !!!!

We ordered the French onion soup, crispy shrimp tacos, stuffed mushrooms, risotto and the mixed grill - all of which we shared.  The soup had a really cool presentation but I found the broth a tad sweet.  The tacos and the mushrooms were absolutely delicious.  The risotto was nice and rich in flavor. The Mixed Grill was quite tasty and I loved the duck confit.  

My husband and I have healthy appetites but we realized we ordered too much for the two of us but we&#39;re happy to have tried several plates.  Next time I want to save room for dessert!  

On top of great food, the service was top notch.  Philip (I hope I have his name correct) was very attentive and made our dining experience very enjoyable.  

I look forward to going to Montarra again.  I could see us popping in to the bar side and ordering the tacos and a few drinks."

One sip from my water glass and my lips met the gritty-dirty feeling that the rim of the cup had not been properly cleaned -- Bleeeeehhhhhhh... I looked down to realize that there was not one, but TWO lipstick prints stuck firmly to my &#34;clean&#34; glass. So gross. My waiter replaced my glass, and then my husband found chunks of food stuck to his silverware, so he also asked for his fork and knife to be replaced. That never happened. Not a good foot to start on, but despite the cleanliness factor, we stuck it out. The food was good, and despite the prices being high ($14 bucks for two duck &#34;cigars&#34; that were about 4&#39;&#39; long), I thought everything was delicious. I made a trip the washroom and discovered their restrooms were in dire need of cleaning. Missing toilet paper, a slopped up stall and the rank smell of urine soured my remaining dining experience. We stopped at 3 appetizers ordered, and asked for our check. 

Bottom line: your food and service are great, but please, PLEASE clean up your restaurant if you expect repeat diners. I think it&#39;s absurd to ask those prices when you can&#39;t even serve your customers with clean dinnerware or provide sanitary restrooms."

We arrived just as they opened at 4pm and were seated right away.  From there it was down hill. Service was extremely poor. After ordering, we waited more than 20 minutes without seeing our waitress.  I actually had to go over to the bar to order drinks and insisted on paying there because I was not going to tip our waiter on drinks after she had completely disappeared.  Please keep in mind that there were maybe 3 people in the whole restaurant at this time, so this was not an issue with dealing with a rush or being under staffed. After complaining to the bartender about our non-existent service, our waiter finally showed up 10 minutes later.  

The fish taco&#39;s were tasty but It took over an hour for our main course, and it really was not worth the price. Again there were only 3 other people in the entire restaurant so our dinner should not have taken over an hour to prepare. There is an unimpressive balance of sweet and spicy with our two main dishes and portions were small.  We frequent upscale restaurants in the Oak Brook area and this place would be out of business within a few months there.  

It is disappointing that this place is said to be the best that the area has to offer. Non-existent service and meager food made both of us regret choosing Montarra for our 10 year anniversary."

But the food has just not impressed us as much as our first visit 3 years ago. It&#39;s been more hit or miss with the dishes we&#39;ve ordered with some things being &#34;great&#39; (lobster mac-n-cheese, any risotto, any soup, any fish. several of the small plates &amp; any dessert) and others either just okay or &#34;meh.&#34;  They have yet to cook a steak to the proper temperature, the ribs we ordered most recently were on the tough side and they are often skimpy with any veggie sides if your dish you selected comes with any - though they do have veggies/sides available for sharing to order a la carte and for those you get a large portion for sharing.

Based on my last review of Montarra Grill,  wrote a letter of complaint to the executive chef.  It took a while to receive a response, but about 2 weeks ago, a reply from from Chef Dave Perlick appeared in my mailbox.

In short, it was a letter of apology  for my disappointing experience, and invited me to return and give Montarra another try for a complimentary dinner for two.  My companion and I took advantage of the invitation this week.

Based on this visit, it was  necessary upgrade my rating to 5 stars.     

My companion eats no meat, as such, only seafood.  In his letter, Executive Chef Perlick offered to prepare an appetizer for two of his choosing.  We advised the server of my companion&#39;s preferences, and  were served a crab cake  and snow-crab legs each with its own special sauce.  It really was very excellent.  

For entrees, my companion again chose the blackened sea bass, and I chose the 6 oz. filet with foie gras and truffle, prepared to just a bit rarer than medium rare. It was ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!  So tender and juicy, it was the best filet I have ever enjoyed.  We shared a bottle of cabernet sauvignon with our entrees.

After finishing our entrees, Chef Dave Perlick visited our table to check on our satisfaction, and also to answer some questions we had regarding the establishment of Montarra Grill. 

For dessert we decided to choose different  selections that we felt would complement each other and share them.  She chose a positively decadent cheese cake and I selected a (blood) orange sorbet with a mixed berry sauce. Eaten together, the result was a fantastic completion to an exceptional dining experience.

It&#39;s chef&#39;s whim and ours was bacon/sweet pea/brie and it was incredible. Almost everything else was really delicious (French onion soup comed in a giant Vidalia onion which I took home and made into spaghetti sauce today), but I won&#39;t be ordering the steaks we got again. My strip was gristly and my husband said he didn&#39;t like his rib eye even as much as the one he gets at Outback. Maybe filet is better?

Still worth going through. We&#39;re trying the bouliabasse next time.  

Tl;dr:
Get the French onion soup and a risotto. Go somewhere else for NY Strip or ribeye."

We had small plates to try different things from the very interesting menu. Our favorite was crab cakes and goat cheese. Dessert was out of this world, toffee pudding with ice cream.. Wow. The only thing that we found odd was that our waitress brought us our bill right when we were starting to have our dessert. She kindly informed us that we have about 25 minutes to pay our bill and leave,because our table had another reservation at 6:15. Once we finished our dessert and second glass of wine, we left of course. The waitress kept watching us. She seemed nice,but I have never experienced anything  like that before... 
The restaurant has beautiful decor,it&#39;s very high end. We will definitely come back."

My husband and I came here recently for my milestone birthday. Upon arriving, the hostess was incredibly friendly and accommodating. She wished me a happy birthday and gave us printed menus specially for my day.

Our server was incredibly kind and knowledgeable. She did a fantastic job on making sure we had everything we needed, but not being overly obnoxious and intrusive through our meal. 

We enjoyed cocktails, beer, and wine -- all pleased with our selections. Our server recommended the special for our appetizer, which was a brie and fresh corn risotto with pork belly. Okay ... this is where I have no words, really! It was so delicious! The risotto was not mushy, just the perfect consistency. The brie flavor was present, but didn&#39;t reach that &#39;funky&#39; taste that brie can have. It was perfectly balanced with the sweet corn and the pork belly, which was seared to perfection and not fatty. A great way to start the evening!

Our main courses were phenomenal as well. While I can understand why some other Yelpers weren&#39;t happy with the portion size, as I see it it&#39;s better to have quality over quantity. I ordered the confit garlic crusted filet mignon, and it is hands down the best filet I&#39;ve ever eaten. Oftentimes, filet can be quite flavorless, but this filet was incredibly tender, moist, tasty, and cooked to the perfect medium. The garlic crust!? Amen. Amazing. My husband ordered off the specials -- a sea bass with poblano and cilantro basmati rice. He really enjoyed it and said the fish was fresh and cooked perfectly. 

We were too full for dessert unfortunately, but it gives us an extra reason to come back to Montarra to sample their desserts! We&#39;d even come back for just drinks with their delicious homemade parmesan flat bread. Yum yum yum! Our hats off to the chef. Thanks for a great experience!"

That being said I really enjoyed my meal. I got the 6oz filet with the boursin cheese and mushrooms. The filet was the best I&#39;ve ever had!  I&#39;m a huge fan of wildfire and in my opinion, this steak is completely better!

The wife and I ate an early dinner right at opening. There were maybe 3 tables with guests yet our waitress was more concerned about chatting up her co-workers rather than doing her actual job. 

As for the food, the over priced steaks (filet and NY strip) had just about zero flavor. On my worst day, steaks at home on the grill are much better. On top of the steaks having no flavor, my NY strip was way under cooked. I ordered it cooked medium and it was just about rare in the center. I had to have the bus boy take it back to the kitchen since the waitress couldn&#39;t be bothered to do her job.

I think best case scenario, someone dining here can expect disappointment and spotty service.

The space with the Chihuly chandelier was taken up by a small private party, but we were seated in a comfortable tall booth. My wife commented on how, with the shades drawn down, you could easily forget you were in the country, let alone in the Algonquin area. The ambience was classy, but not too dark and the service was attentive and patient.

Most of the food was excellent, fresh and full of flavor.

For starters, we got the Maine Lobster Won Tons, which we do not recommend. Though one piece had a giant portion of lobster claw, the others didn&#39;t seem to have even portions. The wrapper was fried perfectly, but the flavor did not stand out as unique.

The other starter was on the specials menu, and it was an Arugula Salad with an Egg and pieces of bacon. I don&#39;t remember the dressing, which makes me sad, because it really tied all the flavors of the dish together. Highly recommend this if it&#39;s on the menu when you get there.

For entrees, I got the Bouillabaisse Montarra, because I&#39;m a sucker for seafood. The mussels were my favorite part, tasting like they were just picked from the sea. The scallops and shrimp were also cooked perfectly tender. The soup was a wonderful combination of savory spices and I made sure to finish until the last drop.

My wife got the Churrasco Skirt Steak, which was cooked exactly to the medium rare she requested. My favorite part of this dish was the Sweet Potato/Chorizo Hash, which merged the salty and sweet so well.

Why did this place fall short of 5 stars? The hostess! She didn&#39;t welcome us warmly when we came in, and though we had reservations, she simply said, &#34;Two?&#34;, grabbed menus and immediately turned to walk away. When I let her know we had reservations, she dismissed it as if to say, &#34;Can&#39;t you see we have plenty of open tables?&#34; On the way out, she was busy fussing with papers at her station and I had to say goodnight in order for her to look up and acknowledge that we were leaving.

Is this a deal breaker, no. Will I come back... sure. I just want a full experience from beginning to end, especially when I go a little out of my budget to treat my wife to something nice. I will definitely upgrade to 5 stars if I get a hello next time I come in."

My wife and I have spent numerous birthday/anniversary celebrations here.  Food is always outstanding, and the service is always friendly.  The restaurant is kind of broken into three areas:  one for the bar, one dining area that is draped off and kind of private/romantic, and one general dining area.  The bar can be loud at times, but we have had a meal in there and it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  Most of the time, we sit in the general dining area, which is very nice in itself.  More on the quiet side over there.  This past trip had us there for the Tequila tasting dinner that they had in the center, draped off room.  What a great meal that was!  Five courses, each with a shot of Tequila and then a mixed cocktail featuring that tequila.  Probably best to line up a designated driver if you come to one of these dinners :-)

One item of note, that I think should be a mandatory order whenever people come, is the Bacon Wrapped Dates.  These are so good, that I have found myself at times calling in a to go order of just these dates.  They are THAT amazing.  Like, if I were to have a final meal, they would be my appetizer, AMAZING!

If you are looking for a special place to take someone for a romantic dinner, or a celebration, don&#39;t hesitate to make reservations here.  I HIGHLY recommend them!"

We ordered olive tapenade, which was good, but not spectacular.  We also ordered the small plate crispy shrimp tacos, amazing and huge.  Comes with two tacos, and filled with fresh, yummy ingredients.  For the main course, which by now we were pretty full, we split the large plate lobster roll sandwich.  The presentation was very cute with a mini fry basket filled with kettle chips, but seemed store bought versus homemade.  The sandwich itself was really good, but being too full just picked the lobster off the roll.  All in all, we will be back."

- You need a change of pace in the Algonquin area
- You are craving seafood

Overall, I thought Montarra was A-OK as evidenced by the 3 stars on yelp. It didn&#39;t blow me away and it wasn&#39;t bad. We waited an exorbitant amount of time for our meals - I think the waitress forgot to put our order in.  She was nice though. 

 We had a reservation but were seated in the bar area which has a totally different vibe than the restaurant section...something to note if you care about that when making a reservation for yourself (restaurant area seems darker and more romantic)  We got one appetizer for the table, bacon-wrapped dates, and they were tasty.  Each of us tried a different seafood dish, and they were all good too. Just nothing mind-blowing.  It&#39;s a little overpriced for what it is.  I would probably not go back since I always have limited time when I&#39;m in Chicago and there are many, many, many, many other delicious places to eat in the Chitown chowtown landscape."

The first time started out ok, service seemed good until a large party arrived shortly after receiving our food and our table of 2 was forgotten.  Maybe i&#39;m in the minority here but I firmly believe that in any establishment ($$$+ especially) the patrons shouldn&#39;t have to flag down a waiter/waitress to get service; that being said my Moscow Mule was never replenished and my $30 severely under cooked steak went uneaten.  By the time the waitress came back my date had finished his 16 oz ribeye (which was luke warm by the time I insisted he eat without me) and I had lost my appetite.  My steak was comped and we left.  
I recently gave them another shot and this visit started out good too, great service.....then 2 of 3 steaks came out under cooked.  I&#39;m no chef but I&#39;ve watched enough cooking shows to know just by the feel if a steak is cooked properly so it&#39;s really irritating to me that 3/5 steaks at this place were not cooked properly.... my son decided to eat his but again mine was too bloody but luckily our waiter was on the ball this time and I was able to send it back.  It was ok....under seasoned (our waiter seemed to disappear for the last leg of our trip so I had to go to the bar and ask for salt...) and either the quality of meat was garbage or the knives were because my BF and I had to massacre our meat to eat it.  When the bill came it wasn&#39;t ours...paying the bill took almost as long as trying to eat a steak at this place...
It&#39;s an expensive lesson but next time I want steak I&#39;ll stick to Outback for dinner and Ruth&#39;s Chris for date night."

As usual, we checked Yelp before deciding where to go. Our experience far exceeded anything we had hoped for.
We shared the bacon wrapped dates, which are probably one of the very best things I have ever put in my mouth. 
I chose to order the evening Risotto. (it changes daily. Last night&#39;s was tomato, basil, artichoke, and divine) we also chose to share a Mac &amp; Cheese as we are questing for the world&#39;s best. Theirs was pretty great!

Being a burger connoisseur, my husband had to try Montarra&#39;s, and he was not disappointed. While it did not rank as his all time favorite, it is his second, which is high praise...

If we lived locally, we would go broke dining here far too often. Fortunately, we visit, and we will be back! (Also... Their cocktails and flat bread are incredible. Nothing bad to say! Amazing atmosphere... Brilliant dining experience!)"

I have been here a handful of times and they NEVER disappoint. I&#39;ve never waited to be seated, the staff is on the ball with stopping by your table and the food is DIVINE. 

I have been to many top notch restaurants around the country, and I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the best filets I&#39;ve had. The filet with the added foie gras and the risotto (with some kind of blueberry drizzle) is SO good. I don&#39;t think I will ever order anything else from here because it&#39;s so good. As I&#39;m sitting here writing this, I&#39;m thinking: I should make another reservation.

Most of the menu items can be modified to accommodate gluten free diners. My boyfriend got the skirt steak entree without gluten or dairy; AMAZING.

Cocktail was fine.  They could stand to open up their beer selection a bit (though the beers they offer are excellent craft beers from a local brewery).

Solid food, some interesting flavors, but there were some execution flaws.  Bacon wrapped dates need crispier bacon, as it was they were mushy textured.  Had the lamb rack/tenderloin/duck confit combination plate, and the portions are extremely generous.  The meat was all cooked well, and though falling apart and very juicy, the duck was unevenly seasoned with some bites being extremely salty.  Spinach and garlic potatoes were fine.  The apparently omnipresent tomatoes and cilantro were welcome on my plate, but seemed out of place on the fish dish my wife had.  The blueberries really made the dish, but more of them were desired, because the dish overall was just too much on the rich meaty, salty, savory notes and didn&#39;t have enough counterbalancing components."

I have been here a handful of times and they NEVER disappoint. I&#39;ve never waited to be seated, the staff is on the ball with stopping by your table and the food is DIVINE. 

I have been to many top notch restaurants around the country, and I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the best filets I&#39;ve had. The filet with the added foie gras and the risotto (with some kind of blueberry drizzle) is SO good. I don&#39;t think I will ever order anything else from here because it&#39;s so good. As I&#39;m sitting here writing this, I&#39;m thinking: I should make another reservation.

Most of the menu items can be modified to accommodate gluten free diners. My boyfriend got the skirt steak entree without gluten or dairy; AMAZING.

The only reason I hesitated with giving them 5 stars is because I want to ensure that it&#39;s never difficult for me to get a reservation here in the future..."

Quite simply it&#39;s overpriced and not exceptional.  Everything we had was decent (onion soup would be mediocre), but not worth returning for.  Having arrived at 5:00 and in a nearly empty restaurant you would think we could have been seated in the main dining area rather than in the bar area.  Not exactly the way to build a good first impression.  Advice is to go to say a Seasons 52 in Schaumburg.  You&#39;ll spend a third less and enjoy the meal more."

Cocktail was fine.  They could stand to open up their beer selection a bit (though the beers they offer are excellent craft beers from a local brewery).

Solid food, some interesting flavors, but there were some execution flaws.  Bacon wrapped dates need crispier bacon, as it was they were mushy textured.  Had the lamb rack/tenderloin/duck confit combination plate, and the portions are extremely generous.  The meat was all cooked well, and though falling apart and very juicy, the duck was unevenly seasoned with some bites being extremely salty.  Spinach and garlic potatoes were fine.  The apparently omnipresent tomatoes and cilantro were welcome on my plate, but seemed out of place on the fish dish my wife had.  The blueberries really made the dish, but more of them were desired, because the dish overall was just too much on the rich meaty, salty, savory notes and didn&#39;t have enough counterbalancing components."

Hadn&#39;t been in awhile so my wife booked it for a nice evening for the 2 of us since I was out of town on business. Seating was dark and ordered an item that had been on menu since day 1. Turns out they changed the menu that night and added scallops. Didn&#39;t tell anyone or point it out. Menu looked same as ever. Change is good except I&#39;m allergic. Ended up our plates came out separate after I had them redo mine. Ruined our evening. Next time they change they should make it clear. My redo plate was not any better than American Airlines food. Spent $200 for a disappointing dinner. After being a loyal diner for 10 or so years, will not back."

I leave the restaurant poorer and hungry. That being said. Monterra was not one of them. 

Yes, it&#39;s fancy. Yes, it&#39;s expensive. But the food and the service was outstanding. And well worth it. Had the lobster ravioli and the fillet. The fillet melted in your mouth and the lobster ravioli ACTUALLY had lobster in it. Both were delicious. The service was exceptional with friendly and helpful staff. 

The after dinner mint was the finishing touch to a great romantic dinner."

The food is amazing and their martinis are excellent, as well!  The Mexican shrimp appetizer is wonderful!  After ordering steaks medium and having the outsides practically well done at both visits I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s probably best to begin ordering my steaks medium rare to avoid this.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were more mashed potatoes under the steaks!  I just ordered an additional side at the last visit and this worked out just fine.  Overall very satisfied and will definitely make it back for future date nights!"

Had to try the desserts we did doughnuts with ice-cream and came with a side of expresso Great over the ice-cream . Chocolate flourless cake amazing. Server was wonderful and helpful .

Not only was the food amazing, the staff and service were amazing, as well! I was entertaining guest and called the restaurant and asked if they had menus that did not contain prices as I feel it allows your guest to enjoy the evening, and order what they&#39;d really want, without worrying about the expense. The response was, &#34;we don&#39;t have menus without prices but I&#39;d be happy to print them up for you&#34;. Having never been to this establishment before, I was worried we&#39;d be handed pieces of copier paper containing the priceless menu.  Much to my delight we were seated and everyone in the party received a substantial leather menu book containing no prices! Our server, Erin, was friendly and extremely knowledgeable about how various dishes were prepared. Now to the food and drink......A-MAZING! Steaks were cooked perfectly, vegetables were crisp and not overcooked. The beet salad alone will bring me back! You will NOT be disappointed! Montarra is a must try!"

The atmosphere is super trendy and intimate at the same time.   The service was attentive and friendly.  I enjoyed all the food.  The drinks were strong and delicious  That is a combination you do not normally witness in my reviews.

I ordered the French Onion Soup which came out looking all cute in an onion bowl.  I would order it again just for onion bowl!  My boyfriend had the lobster bisque which was good, but had nothing on my soup, which did I mention came in an onion?!

We ordered steaks for our meals.  I had a fillet Mignon with blue cheese.  The steak came out cooked just the way I like it, medium rare plus.  You would be surprised how many steakhouses cannot cook a steak to your order, but Montarra can!

I cannot wait to come back on a future date night!"

I had eaten here before many moons ago but couldn&#39;t remember if I enjoyed it or not.  I DID remember it had Oberweis &amp; Giordano&#39;s, two huge faves of mine, next door though! 

We had reservations at 6 but arrived 15 minutes early.  They said our table was ready.   As it was near the front, we asked to move tables &amp; were seated elsewhere with no issue. Good service start in my opinion &amp; service throughout the night was excellent.  Water glasses were never empty (&amp; I think I drank the Fox River dry), waitress (Kristina?) was very good &amp; knowledgable on all menu items &amp; was honest with us on food that was great &amp; not so great.  

We started with the filet mignon crisps &amp; pork belly sliders.  As a bacon/pork belly afficianado (who isn&#39;t?!), I was excited to try these.  The 4 crips were small, as expected, but were very tasty.  The sliders....well, I don&#39;t know what to say.  I had 1.5 of the 3.  The overall taste was very good.  The only issue was the first bite I took of mine, I felt something big &amp; hard in it.  It not only threw me mentally for the night but also orally.  It&#39;s hard to describe but felt like the texture mix of finger &amp; water chestnut.  I spat it out &amp; was a big hunk of really hard, unusual crust fat.  I had a bite of Kelly&#39;s &amp; had the same experience.  Pork belly should never have a big crunch...ever.  It shook me for the whole night.  

As far as entrees, Kelly&#39;s mom ordered the salmon, Kelly ordered some scallops on the shell &amp; I ordered the 10 oz Montarra filet stuffed with boursin cheese and mushrooms on the side.  Kelly&#39;s mom enjoyed the salmon. I did not sample it but it looked extremely good.    Kelly said her scallops were tasty but grainy. I had a bite of one &amp; thought it was pretty good but agreed it seemed grainy.  Perhaps not washed or cleaned thorougly enough?   My filet was cooked to perfection  but wasn&#39;t as tender as I&#39;d hoped &amp;  not seasoned AT ALL. The filet also wasn&#39;t &#39;stuffed&#39; as I had envisioned but had a 1&#34; pocket cut in the side with the cheese stuffing,  which was underwhelming as well.  It came with whipped mashed potatoes.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of whipped taters, as various restaurants have varying definitions of whipped.  Regardless, they were too whipped for my liking, almost to a cream consistency &amp; were under the filet, which I hate.  I want my taters to taste like taters, be a bit more mashed/starchy &amp; on the side. 

We ordered dessert.  My lovely dinner dates both had the creme brulee.  Still emotionally &amp; physically struggling with the filet &amp; sliders, I wasn&#39;t about to spend more money on a dessert when an Oberweis shake was next door, cheaper &amp; would be just what the doctor ordered to fix me up.  The brulees came out &amp; they were much larger than I had anticipated, probably a good 6&#34; in diameter.  Kelly&#39;s mom said it was the best creme brulee she&#39;d ever had.  Kelly said hers was very good as well but not the best ever.  I sampled it to see &amp; it was very good.  

All in all, I was torn leaving this place.  I really wanted to like it more, given the service, ambience &amp; food options, plus the ladies relaly liked it.  However, I t couldn&#39;t get past the meat disappointments I had experienced.  I&#39;m not eager to go back, but I wouldn&#39;t totally object if it was for a special outing again.  The ladies really liked it for the most part.   Perhaps I just ordered the wrong things or the chef had a rough night. I&#39;d give it a 5 on service and MY food was a 2 so we&#39;ll call it a 3."

Our waitress was great, very friendly .... but it was a bit slow. It was busy, and I&#39;m not sure how many tables our waitress was handling at once, so maybe she was just overloaded?

The filet was tasty...very tasty, but the sauce I recalled previously just did not taste the same. Still, it was delicious.... it just didn&#39;t leave me the desire to lick my plate like in the past.

One member of our party ordered her filet medium well, and it came more medium, medium rare -- when she sent it back, it came back shriveled and darkened. They rectified it immediately and actually brought her out a new filet, which this time they executed perfectly.

We also got 2 comped desserts for the error, and that member of our party also received a gift card for a future visit. So they really did go above &amp; beyond in rectifying the problem and realizing the mistake.

Overall, still a great place to dine. Oh -- do yourself a favor and enjoy your meal with a glass (ah heck, go ahead and order the bottle) of Moscato D&#39;Asti.  You can thank me later."

The place is comfortable and they have done a great job at transforming the strip mall space into a welcoming/romantic setting. We sat in the bar area and I am glad we did- the other side looked a bit too stuffy for us. The martinis were very good, the food was outstanding and the service was exceptional. Overall it was very good experience- I look forward to going back.
Also, there have been a few comments on here about the price. Yes, i suppose its expensive for the area but last time I took the family to subway it was like $35- five dollar foot longs be damned! I felt that the prices are fair and that a bill of $190 for two people that included eight cocktails, two appetizers, two entrées, coffee, one dessert and tip was fair. We really enjoyed the evening and hope to meet up with a small group here in the future."

But once you find it, you will not be disappointed! We saw a photo gallery of nearby restaurants at  the local library and saw a photo of petite filet mignon over a Gorgonzola crisp and port wine reduction which is part of their small plates menu. We could have had several servings of that alone and been happy! The filets were cooked to perfection and everything on the plate complimented them perfectly. It was hard to chose from all the complex yet accessible dishes on their menu. I recommend the mixed grill of filet mignon, rack of lamb, and duck confit leg over Gorgonzola crisp and a blueberry reduction. 

We arrived soon after opening and it was quiet enough to soak in the understated atmosphere. It was a little dark for our liking, but the waterfall wall and paintings were interesting. The service however was a little dicey at first . Our waitress was chatting with people she apparently knew the next table over and we sat there quite awhile before we were acknowledged. It took the hostess to come over to her and whisper in her ear that she has customers waiting before she reacted. Despite that minor incident (but one worth mentioning  since the place has a Zagat rating of 28 for their service as well as their food), the waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and the staff overall was friendly and attentive. 

This is a must visit destination the next time you are in the western suburbs of Chicago, you will not regret it!"

First off, they got our reservation wrong. We reserved for a party of 6 (birthday dinner for mom) but they had the reservation for 3. Big difference. Fortunately they could accommodate us but hey put us in the dining are where the bar is located. All the surfaces are hard so the noise level is verging on intolerable. I had to talk very loud to the person sitting right next to me. Additionally there was a TV in this room with the Cubs game on. Really? At $100 per person, one would expect to be able to enjoy your diner mate&#39;s company. Most of us had two small plates. If we all ordered entrees I imagine the price per person would have been closer to $150.

Second, the cocktails were horrible!!! Cocktails should have liquor in them. I had a gin cocktail and could not taste the gin at all. Gin has a pretty recognizable favor. There was none. The others had the same complaint about their drinks. If you&#39;re going to charge downtown prices for a cocktail, make downtown cocktails!

The pacing of service was off for the entire meal. It took a long time to order drinks, get drinks, place our food order and get items. We had a 6:00 reservation. A restaurant should have their act together that early in the evening. We ordered a bottle of wine to accompany our first course appetizers which came after we had eaten them. No one came back to re-fill our glasses. They charged us an automatic 20% tip on our bill but the service did not warrant this.

The food was hit or miss. I ordered the bacon wrapped dated which were supposed to be stuffed with Gorgonzola. Again Gorgonzola is a powerful flavor their was none. Tacos were bland. The scallops and shrimp appetizers were good. The lamb lollipops were tender and had a good sauce. The foie gras appetizer was very small but delicious. I ordered the risotto of day which was supposed to include andouille sausage. There was no sausage so they had to re-make the dish. By the time I got my meal, everyone else was done eating and the risotto was over cooked. They would have gotten kicked off &#34;Top Chef&#34;. If you can&#39;t make risotto, don&#39;t serve it!  We order another bottle of wine to go with dinner our glasses were never re-filled but we were forced to tip on the service. The dessert were pretty straight forward, flour less chocolate cake, creme brulee and sticky toffee pudding. All were well executed but nothing unusual, new or interesting. 

Over all a poor experience on my mom&#39;s special day. They are unable to service a  full dining room on a Saturday night and the food is just average."

Impeccable décor and service await you along with a great fine dining experience.

The martinis are excellent and Ben the bartender is very accommodating.

Now for the good stuff.  The stuffed mushrooms come stuffed with a cream sauce and crab lumps.  Amazing!

The French onion soup is served in an onion and was seasoned perfectly with a hint of salt and sweetness unlike any other French onion soup my wife or myself have ever had.

The ribeye was cut to the perfect thickness with just the right amount of fat for flavor.  Incredibly hard to pull off.  Probably the best ribeye I have ever had.

My wife had the gnocchi and I had a bite and the sauce was amazing.

The crème brulee was crisp on top and creamy underneath and served with a raspberry sauce that would leave few people complaining.

In all, I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.  If you are in the northwest suburbs for dinner it is a must try."

Vegetarians, be warned!  Lamb lollipops were okay. I&#39;ve had better at weddings. The Filet Mignon was awesome; garlic-herb crusted and topped with a marrow-wine reduction. My husband got a fancy gourmet burger, topped with Boursin, crispy onions and a homemade creamy herb dressing that was heavenly. I had a pistachio gelato topped peach crostada for dessert, which was tasty, but too huge for one person. We should have shared dessert. I was totally disappointed in the wine list.... bottles such as Kim Crawford for $42. Sorry, but if I know I can get that bottle at the grocery store for $12, I&#39;m not going to order it at a restaurant. They need a sommelier."

That was kind of odd. Everything else food wise was okay. The hostess not good enough for a higher end restaurant, with tables open all around she had us standing at a table waiting for a server to move a tray.

The noise level was pretty high, but I was able to hear my wife across the table(barely), so it didn&#39;t bother me.
  Started off with the calamari special. I have to say it was outstanding. A good portion size and a ton of flavor. We also had to try the French onion soup, which a friend recommended to us. It did not disappoint. A little hard to eat as it was served in an onion, but again, bursting with flavor.
  The entrees took a slight turn the other way. My wife had the mahi mahi special and it was amazing. A lot of flavor, perfectly cooked. I had the mixed grille and I have to say I was very disappointed, especially since the last time I had a Boursin stuffed filet here, i was blown away. The mixed grille consists of duck conceit, lamb, and a filet. The duck was the only protein on my plate that was worth mentioning. Very tender, well cooked and well seasoned. The lamb was perfectly cooked but NO seasoning!! Not the slightest hint of salt, very bland. The filet was overcooked and UNSEASONED. I ordered the meat medium rare and it came out a strong medium, pushing medium well. The lack of seasoning was again very disappointing, especially since that is cooking 101, season your meat!!! The sauces and potatoes were very good, but in no way made up for the other faults on my plate. $40 disappointment. 
  The only reason I gave it four stars is because of a previous experience, so I know they are capable of great meals...just not tonight."

Environment/decor:
Agree with other reviews that state ambiance is very nice especially when considering your in a strip mall. Glass chandler and waterfall partition very nice (pump on water full could be heard over conversation). Tables are very close together and restaurant in on the loud side.

Food::
We had a sampling of offerings - all were good-  non were out of this world. 

Small Plates:
Daily risotto was the star (Corn and Bousin cheese). Chef has an infinity for Bousin cheese as it in is the majority of menu offerings. We also tried the talapia tacos - good. Nice slaw on top, accompanying salsa very spicy.Bacon wrapped scallops with praline sauce were good, scallops were just slightly under cooked and bacon over cooked - dish was good/standard.

Big Plates:
Mixed grill, sampling of filet, lamb chops, and duck confit. The brussle sprouts with bacon were very good, polenta was standard. Lamb and filet cook perfectly. Duck confit was good. Accompanying sauces were good. Beef tips came and were good but arrived as almost a stew over mashed potatoes, not what expected - yet good. Mac n Cheese side was highlight - very creamy and as menu stated - meant to share.
Dessert:
Pecan Pie was very good, crust slightly on the think side. Affogato, specialty and very popular dessert according to server, was ill conceived -  yet very good. Fresh fried &#34;donuts&#34; that you dip into an a bowl that arrives with vanilla ice cream and the server pour hot espresso over. leaves you with a bowl of melted cold espresso after eating/dipping three donuts.

Service:
Excellent service. Server and team were very attentive.

Price:
As the food is good but not out of this world I would say prices are on the high side of reasoble. Saved by being a non chain suburban resturant and excellent service."

We drove around the downtown area and it was between Prairie Rock and a Thai place.  Prairie Rock obviously won.

We were first greeted by a giant wooden bear and LOTS of grill smoke, so I didn&#39;t have high hopes going in. 

Out waitress was nice in that she accommodated my +1&#39;s various questions, many of which one could only answer based on personal preference (and we all know all of our taste buds are different). For questions she couldn&#39;t answer, she did offer to double check.  She DID say that the pickle spears were her favorite things, period.  

We did go with our waitress&#39; suggestion on the apps. I had the shrimp tacos (3 of &#39;em, technically listed as an appetizer as well).  My +1 was torn between a burger or the &#34;Extreme&#34; chicken wings, and he got the latter (8 of &#39;em) - half in Buffalo sauce and the other half in Teriyaki.

She didn&#39;t steer us wrong: the pickle spears were FANTASTIC!  They were breaded with a breading that had dill in it, and came with a dipping sauce.

The shrimp tacos were good but REALLY heavy on the lettuce/cilantro.  No matter, though - I like my roughage and they were satisfying without making me too full afterwards.  The shrimp were not overcooked or rubbery (as often happens), and the chipotle ranch sauce was kind of tasty.  Sadly it lacked a little bit of heat that I thought it might have.  

My +1 really enjoyed his wings, though the &#34;extreme&#34; and &#34;jumbo&#34; claims were kind of ridiculous to me, as they really were standard sized wings.  (I&#39;ve had JUMBO wings at Gator&#39;s in Palatine.)

Did I mention that all of our food came out piping hot?!  As in, curls of smoke eminating from the food and it being so hot that you have to wait a second to eat it?  Awesome.  I like that there were a few vegetarian items on the menu, too, including a veggie burger. 

To sum, Prairie Rock&#39;s food trumps it&#39;s kitzchy decor and was a pretty solid place to eat."

Two days ago me and my s.o. went in to grab some lunch around 2p.m. There were only a handful of people in there(which I liked because we went lonely lol). They were blasting some pretty chill music and we were served pretty quickly. The waitress didn&#39;t get our refills until they were empty, (and considering it wasn&#39;t too busy) we tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. 

I ordered the fried hotdog, wrapped in bacon with cheese. Go for it! So delicious. Boyfriend got the &#34;I just want a burger&#34; burger. He is THE burger king. He can usually down a burger without blinking. He could not finish it, because he was getting full. Still, it looked good and he said it tasted good.My hotdog and his burger, came with coleslaw and homemade chips that weren&#39;t bad. My food was only like $6. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back. I mean, I&#39;m thinking about that hotdog right now..."

I ordered the Ultimate grilled cheese, added bacon and tomatoes.  The ultimate in poor decisions.  Plain old boring grilled cheese with a piece of bacon and a clump of chopped tomatoes in the middle.  Oh, and a Bloody Mary.  Worst I&#39;ve ever had.  Tasted like tomato juice and half a bottle of Tabasco.  How this place ever got even a single star from a reviewer ia beyond me.  Perhaps they reviewed it while passed out drunk.

We came here remembering the old Prairie Rock Brewing Co Restaurant. Unfortunately that is long gone! My margarita, if you could call watered down lemonade that may or may not have had any alcohol in it a margarita, came in a Pabst Blue Ribbon disposable plastic cup. Asked for the Mac and cheese side ($3.00 up charge) and got a penny&#39;s worth of penne with a blob of canned nacho-spiced cheese on it.

We had reservations for 15 people on half price burger Wednesday.   When we arrived at the restaurant we were literally the only people in the restaurant.  Apparently there was about 22 people eating outside.  The service was incredibly slow.  Pitchers of water were put in between people on our table but never refilled.  Plastic cups were only given to us when we continued to request them.  

We all ordered food at the same time, however it took 30 minutes for the first of the food plates to arrive and it only got worse.  One to two meals were given at a time.  The first 4 people in our group had finished their meal, in fact ordered a second meal, and 8 people has not even been served.  The waitress never once apologized or came to ask if we needed anything to drink.  She also would never clear plates when bringing a new one out, so dirty plates and glasses continued to pile up on tables.  The last meal was served an hour and a half after ordering.  

When we asked to speak to management, we were told there was no manager.  &#34;They left earlier.&#34;  I asked to speak to a supervisor and finally another waitress took responsibility to come and apologize.  She did her best to help, but overall the servers were incompetent and rude.  7 out of 15 meals were incorrect and made wrong.  

This ended up being a great place to meet with friends because of how quiet it was (since no one was there) and how long it took the food to come, so we had time to catch up.  I would NEVER recommend this restaurant!"

Since the fest got cancelled many people just went home. I ordered a Summer Shandy and was informed that they only had that out on the patio and it was locked up and no one there had a key...really?!?!

My first soda was flat and tasted like soap residue. My second soda was flat and also tasted like soap. Turkey burger comes out and it&#39;s bland with no seasoning what so ever. I am guessing the burger was frozen because all the liquid coming out of it that was soaking my bun and my sweet potato fries tasted like very old fry oil. As soon as they hit the fry oil I could smell the burnt smell. Sad sad. I&#39;m going back to the other restaurant that I liked on Friday across town.

It&#39;s a great place to meet up with friends. During the summer their beer garden is great. However, lately, I&#39;ve noticed a slip on their customer service. For example, there is a younger gentleman behind the bar that is continuously rude to patrons. Also, I have timed the amount of time it has taken before someone from the bar asks you if they can get you anything. Once it was a 10 minute wait. There were two other people in the whole place at the time.
Now, it&#39;s not like we are spending a mere $20-30 bucks. We spend quite a bit whenever we come here. Other than that, we still come perhaps because of what the place once was. Their beer selection has gone down, but if you know what you are doing you can still get a few good brews here. Otherwise we go to the Walnut Speakeasy."

Firstly this was my first time back to the &#34;new&#34; prairie rock which is not to be confused to the original &#34;prairie rock brewery&#34; back in its hay day.  

That being said, this smaller yet still nostalgic part of the former brewery still retains the original charm, albeit in a smaller venue.   With that said, the food was good...really good.  I would have to contribute a large part of that to the attentive wait staff who stayed on top of the kitchen to make sure everything was right. 

If you go to this establishment do yourself a favor and ask for Melinda.  You are going to not only be well attended but well entertained as well!  Melinda is one of those personalities / people, who make the &#34;newer&#34; Prairie Rock feel like you&#39;ve come home to your favorite local neighborhood bar.  

Witty, Intelligent, and yes, extremely comical Melinda and Prairie Rock for lunch is a a solid win.  We would have to say they deserve a 4 star rating.  The 1/2 lb Angus burgers are fantastic - great beef.  The garlic and cilantro fries are good enough to be a main entree, they taste that good.   

As for brews, they have a nice selection of IPAs, Specials and Domestics.  I had a delicious Vanilla Port (actually 3 of them) that were fantastic.   Parking in the area is plentiful, stop on by, say hello to Melinda and order a Port and Burger for lunch, the rest of your day will be a walk in the park!"

Not sure if it&#39;s a fair system but we ended up leaving after waiting about 10 minutes for drinks when the place was clearly not even at a dozen people .  We tried giving it a chance by going outside to their beer garden but the service was even worse.  Overall ok to stop by not OK to stay.

Our experience was the same both times.  Poor service.  Food that was simply edible and a limited (they were out of a number of beers they advertised they carried) and warm beer selection.  To top it off, the gentleman walking around boasting to be &#34;the owner&#34;, Mike, never once smiled or offered a kind word.  Instead he walked around offering excuses and blaiming everyone else for the poor service.

I am from the city of Chicago as well, but I LOVE going to these family owned kind of places.  Great food and great service.  It was their own recipes that made this place a hit for us.  My parents usually go out to chain restaurants, so when I introduced this to them, at first they were apprehensive because it&#39;s your usual Bar/Grill (and we don&#39;t drink), but there&#39;s nothing like 67 year old lady enjoying wings and ordering more.  The burgers were delicious, they made them to order, and were very accomodating with my father&#39;s health restrictions (easing on the salt, etc).

Ricky, the bar tender, was extremely attentive and just all around a wonderful server.  He made sure we always had drinks and that we were well tended to.  

The new Prairie Rock is not only better than the old one, it&#39;s one of the best restaurants in town.  This is saying a lot considering how Outback, Chilis, Lone Star, and Applebees have all gone down hill.  

The food was one of the best meals my fellow diner and I had had in years.  We sampled the artichoke dip with chips, and it was the best ever.  I had the penne pasta with shrimp and my fellow diner had a bacon cheeseburger.  Delightful!  And while the vanilla porter is not quite like the vanilla pale ale that &#34;the Rock&#34; used to serve (for obvious reasons), it&#39;s pretty darn close, and certainly a contender.  

Overall we were delighted with the food and the service.  Top notch.  If that&#39;s the kind of quality they&#39;re serving up late on a Tuesday night, well just imagine how good it could be on karaoke night or on a Friday or Saturday.

Thank you Prairie Rock for one of the best dining experiences in Elgin in years."

I came here with a friend on a Friday night to grab a few drinks and dinner. We walked in and the bartender told us we could sit where ever we wanted, thanks.

First I have to say we were walking past after zombie fest and I heard the sound of a live band outside excited as it&#39;s cold and usually nothing going on outside for bars I wanted to go over! Band was great and now needed a drink where we met the bartender Greg (let me explain I am a bartender who takes this night off every year not to deal with amateurs dressed like bigger idiots as they already are and I know I could never bare giving service with a smile so I do everyone a favor and not work.)Greg was great fast bartender for what he had out there and was great with customers even had me and my boyfriend laughing while he talked to other people. We stuck around spent some more money and chatted with him a bit more. This is where it went down hill for me..... What is the name of this bar I asked shocked as earlier I was inside and had to leave because of the giant joke this place was. Walked in and it was semi busy tables were full nothing crazy I would hope as busy as a typical sat night. It took me 15 mins to get a beer I literally stood there to what seemed to be a regular felt so bad he got out of his stool and let me get right in there to get a drink with his help and him calling a bartender I got a beer. Clearly that was not going to happen again. The worst part was the bartenders were barley serving to busy talking to eachother and what seemed to be the owner as he would walk back there from time to time then stand there and watch his bar suck! Pretty sad I just watched dollar signs flying away ps owner not having fast bartenders back there = slower service = customers not drinking = them leaving like myself = less sales!!! This place would of got negative stars if it was not for Greg!! The owner or manager what ever he was needs to wake up I would not go out of my way to go here ever again

I REALLY wanted this place to at the very least woo me.. not knock me out, or even stun me.. but just show me potential. Unfortunately.. I was really disappointed.. After all I read about the place and the new owners I may have set myself up for failure.   As my brother said, our beers were lukewarm.. the waitstaff/bar staff should have known that the second the beer hit the glass.  My wife had the buffalo chicken sandwich witch was a sad dry excuse for a piece of chicken.  The beer list was impressive so that might be the saving grace.  The &#34;average&#34; steak fries and mediocre food will not bring me back.  If Tommy D goes back, perhaps I&#39;ll tag along, but I would most likely wait till the full menu is up.

It was an Elgin staple for many years until it was closed about 2 years ago. (not sure why). Well it&#39;s been started up again (minus the brewery-part...which is a shame, cuz the beer was pretty darn good.) Anyway.. we popped in there on a Saturday night around 6pm. The bar area is pretty awesome. very old, rustic and orginal decor held over from the building&#39;s previous life as a theater and then a biker-gang hideout*.  High ceilings, lots of exposed brick and timber with a large old school bar. The clientele were a mixed bag of younger 20&#39;s, some families (I was there with my parents, niece, son, bro and sis-in-law) and we were&#39;t out of place. 
So the menu..
It&#39;s tiny. Like a chicken sandwich and a Caesar salad-small. There aint shit on the menu. So we decided to focus on the beer. the beer selection was plentiful. Lots of craft brews on tap. It took a while to make our selections. But when mine and my bro&#39;s drafts arrived.. they were lukewarm. Like as if.. the keg wasn&#39;t cold. Whatever.. fine. We all kinda picked a mixed bag of items from the menu, for snacking more or less.. and the food wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. Typical, un-inspired bar food. No vegetarian options (aside from a salad). And they charged me $7 for a basket of steak fries. Really!?! (I sound cheap again, i know.. but $3 or $4 ok.. but shit man, $7?!?!). 
I did notice a little post-it on the menu stating that they recently had a soft-opening and that a full menu will be available after April 10th. So since it&#39;s near my family and the beer selection is good, I&#39;m gonna give this joint another try. Lord knows Elgin could use another great bar/restaurant spot.. here&#39;s hoping they do well!

*I made that part up, I think."

We live in the city and a place like this wouldn&#39;t last a month there with all of the competition of restaurants with infinitely better food. Not to mention the service was horrid. My boyfriend&#39;s beer glass was cracked in two places and it took nearly 45 minutes to get our food. I had the pasta with steak and bleu cheese sauce and it looked like slop in my bowl it was piled so high. It was enough food to feed four people. It tasted downright strange, had a sour flavor that did not really resemble bleu cheese, the steak pieces were chewy, and it was lukewarm when I got in and cold within a couple minutes. My boyfriend had the steak which he asked for medium. It was medium rare, more on the rare side. The vegetables served with it were frozen mixed vegetables when I thought all restaurants served fresh. To add to this, when a band started to warm up a guy came to our table and told us we had to pay a 5 dollar cover. We were basically finished eating and said that no were weren&#39;t staying for the band. This guy needs to learn some manners. And the final coup de grace is my boyfriend got sick from his food at this place. Whatever you do, do not visit this establishment. It is a waste of time and money and might even make you sick!"

They should have waited to advertise till they were done with remodal &amp; menu changes. Though the remodeling has nothing to do with that, because the tables were clean. 

Walked in around 830pm. Says open till 10 or 11. Asked to make sure kitchen was open, &amp; hostess/bartender wasnt sure. Went to ask someone, who was not really happy that there was two people wanting to eat, but said they would serve us (Better to have convo quietly so guests cant hear). Sat down, waitress/bartender was nice. 

Ordered food, poppers for app, Chicken fajitas for him &amp; pulled pork for me (on recommendation from the waitress). I also got cup of soup (cheddar broccoli), which was burnt and curdled. The fajitas had no seasoning at all, minus some salt &amp; pepper sprinkled on them. Mostly it was green peppers and onions, only 5 strips of chicken (grilled). However, the lettuce &amp; tomato were fresh so that was good. The pulled pork was good, but not good enough for me to go back just for it. The poppers were great though.

I think this place has potential, &amp; hooe the new owners can turn it around. I will try this place again in the future, &amp; will update my review accordingly."

It was supposed to be a bit spicy, and it wasn&#39;t, but it was still flavorful and the chicken wasn&#39;t dry,  which is the usual state of restaurant chicken sandwiches.  They had a great selection of side dishes to accompany your burger/sandwich of choice, including fried zucchini.  The beer list is decent, as other yelpers have mentioned.  The atmosphere is fun - a bit kitschy with a western theme.  We sat on the screened in porch and had a very pleasant experience.  My mouth isn&#39;t watering due to an immense craving to go back, but if I&#39;m in town on a weeknight looking for a quick bite to eat, I&#39;d definitely keep this restaurant on the short list."

We went last Saturday night and they were out of at least 4 tap beers the service was super slow, and it had to be over 80 degrees in there.  The slow service was odd considering the place was really empty. This was our go to spot in Batavia, need to find a new one. I&#39;m also not a fan of the new decor, it looks really cheap.

Added bonus, the owner responded and thinks I am not credible."

The Range had a great Ambiance, and was a neat alternative in the Tri-Cities with it&#39;s Western Range look and feel. But now it&#39;s called Ronin 47? ( I&#39;m sorry, not a good name for this place, is it a Samurai Movie or dining? ) And they butchered &#34;The Range Western&#34; feel , by doing the worse thing you can do to a Restaurant, &#34;Not know what you want to be&#34;  Is it a Sports bar ? There are now TV&#39;s in Dining area, and the Bar is now part of the Dining area. Is it Fine Dining ? The tables have white paper covers. The bar use to be cozy and private from the Dining, now there are bright Neon beer signs and a view to the dining area patrons eating :( The Service was average, the Servers looked a bit unkept, and the floor was very dirty. The food was average but served luke warm at best. It&#39;s very loud/Noisy , since they have turned it into one big room with tables, which also makes it less private. Sad to say , I probably won&#39;t be back, my Suspicions tell me this is an Owner/operator that thought he could be more successful by changing the whole Concept, instead of improving what was already there. I&#39;m gonna miss the Western theme of &#34;the Range&#34; and the good Chili."

Secondly, the waitress brought out my other sons food and spilled the fries on the table.  She proceeded to pick up the fries with her hands and put them back on his plate.

Third, my wife ordered the fish tacos.  They were the most obnoxiously big tacos I have ever seen.  Basically, they fried up a giant piece of fish and put it on taco.  I&#39;ve never seen anything quite like it.  

Lastly, the food is way overpriced.  We were there to try the place once and this will be the last.  Awful!"

Server Sarah P was very professional, knowledgeable, helpful and cute.
Try the brisket poppers -were different and delicious!
Prime rib was perfect 
Brisket was amazingly 
My wife&#39;s salad was crisp fresh and the chicken was warm, a nice plus.
Chicken sandwich was yum.
The burger buns were amazing.
I was really impressed with the customer service skills of the young staff. Someone has taken a lot if time to refine. Plates were cleared fast and friendly.
Amazing staff.
Beer specials $2 even in a Saturday night.
Not a thing I can say that was negative.
What a joy!

You&#39;re not going to find a ton of beer you haven&#39;t tried before (if you&#39;re a beer snob like me) but there are good choices and a couple you may not have seen nonetheless. 

We came here Sunday right before the (opening) Bears Packers game. Totally thought they&#39;d be packed and we&#39;d have to wait but no one was here! I mean, awesome for me, but not so much for management. It kind of scared me that I picked a dive with crappy food but apparently The Range is just slightly off the grid enough to be a secret because they have absolutely awesome food. Seriously...the burger here was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. I got the Honky Tonk (add blue cheese!) and it was fantastic. A delicious seasoned patty, cooked medium (which you ask for but rarely get at most places), ooey gooey with sauce and cheese and runny egg, and topped with nice thick crispy bacon. Mmmmmm.  I&#39;m having a mouthgasm just thinking about it. My man got the brisket and thought it was great too. We even got a free kids meal with our adult meal purchase (maybe a Sunday deal?) and she mangia&#39;ed on those chicken nuggets like they were going out of style. Point is, we will be back for the food alone. 

For those who care about service and ambiance: Service from the waitress was alright. If it were busy it may have been a different story, but it was dead in there so it was good enough. The owner stopped by a couple times too to run food, ask about refills, and make sure everything was cool. He was genuinely really nice and cared that you were having a good time. Nice touch. The ambiance was very hunting cabin with a summery party twist. You know, wood, antlers, drinking signs, kitschy stuff. I don&#39;t care either way as long as the food is good but if you need something fancy, this place isn&#39;t for you. 

Overall, The Range is awesome.  Go here. But don&#39;t tell TOO many friends because I still don&#39;t want to wait for a table."

I had the strawberry beer to start- something I&#39;d never tried before- and I really enjoyed the drink.

We were there on the night of a Chicago Blackhawks playoff game- and the bar was very crowded while the rest of the restaurant was not. I feel like this would be a great place to sit on the porch outside, but we wanted to watch the end of the game so opted to sit inside. Our server was very pleasant, and our food was a-ok. I enjoyed my entree and tempura zucchini side but was less crazy about the corn based side- I probably wouldn&#39;t get that again. My husband had a burger which he couldn&#39;t finish- one of the specialties of the house- and he loved his dish. I probably would have given my dinner 3 stars- but with excellent service and a four start dish for my spouse- I&#39;m doing 4 overall. I&#39;d definitely like to come back and try some of the other menu items- and with the close proximity to the local movie theater, we just might!"

Nice ambiance and really good bar environment. The appetizers are great to pair with beer. I am not 21 however, so I just ordered some milk. They gave me half a glass, which I was disappointed about. Our waitress seemed a little ditsy, as she kept coming back and reminding us that she&#39;s waiting on our food. Obviously, otherwise our food would be in front of us... But when we did get our food, I couldnt wait to dig in. Their burgers are huge and cooked pretty accurately to my direction. They did however have a charred outer coating, which you could palpably taste and I would rather do without. Our check was prompt and our waitress was very nice despite the lack of experience she may have. I would go there again."

I had heard some good things about both the beer selection and the food, so I was excited to give it a try.  Service was good for the most part, but when 2 of us ran out of beer and ordered another, none was brought.  The owner came over and immediately brought us beers, can&#39;t ask for more than that, the rest of the service was good.  The beer menu is great with a lot of micro brews and harder to find beers.  The food is great, the burger comes in a cast iron skillet and was cooked to perfection, my friend got the beef brisket and the portion was absolutely huge and he said it was delicious.  I would definitely come back here, they have a nice screened in porch area and the rest of the place was clean and nice."

On Sunday afternoon, we visited nearby St. Charles for the annual Scarecrow Festival. It was my birthday and so I got to be the decision maker. After the fest, we headed over to Batavia to try what sounded like some yummy food at the Open Range American Grill. 

The parking lot has an odd shape and minimal spots, but there were spots on the street and what appeared to be more parking across the way. We parked on the street and wandered in. There were no customers. Uh oh. Now what?  Do the five of us turn and leave?  The reviews were good so we stuck it out. 

I&#39;m glad we did.

We sat at a large table in the bar area. We had a perfect view of a large screen tv and plenty of elbow room. That was a plus. People slowly filled in the space. The Bears weren&#39;t playing and it was mid-afternoon on a Sunday so I think we may have just been there at an off time. 

The menu had a nice variety of items. I wanted the crab cakes. I know, what&#39;s wrong with me?  Ordering crab cakes at what appears to be a bar that serves food rather than a restaurant which serves drinks. I asked the server. Her menu knowledge was somewhat limited and she described the crab cakes as: um, mushy and not really what you&#39;d expect. Okay - no crab cakes for me. 

I ended up with a plain chicken sandwich and some onion strings. It was good. Nothing fancy or memorable, but it served its purpose. My son ordered a California club and roasted veggies. He was a fan of the whole dish. The hubby and my sister went with beef brisket. This dish came with the option of two sides. He chose chili and baked beans (said he&#39;d come back for the beans) and she chose chili and fries (the waffle cut fries did not impress but the chili was a hit).  My brother in law chose a steak sandwich with baked beans. It arrived with sweet potato fries in error. Getting the correct beans took some effort, but we worked it out eventually. 

The server encouraged the tempura zucchini. We tried it as an appetizer with a chipotle ranch dipping sauce. It was tasty but I&#39;m glad that no one chose that as their side. It was too greasy. 

Overall, the beer selection was wide, the menu options plentiful and the service was okay. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily make this a destination restaurant but I would probably visit again if I was in the area."

First, for an appetizer, we ordered the Brisket Poppers, and they did not have any brisket in them. They were pretty good otherwise, but we could not seem to find the meat!

We brought our 4 kids with us tonight, as kids were to eat free off the kids menu, but it is only one kids meal per one adult meal, which is ok, but not stated anywhere until the final bill came.  Also, the menu has a large burger selection, but there is no kids burger, so we had to pay 10.99 to get a cheeseburger for one of our kids, not the end of the world, but to note.

In regards to food, the brisket and pulled pork are marginal at best. My wife had the pork, and I had the brisket. The brisket was dry and flavorless, and pork was decent, with a smokey flavor. Those who know BBQ know that the sides can also make the meal. There were not any original sides to note, and when I asked about the &#34;Corn and Queso&#34;, the waitress said she has never tried it, but heard it was good. When it came, it was canned corn with a slice of american cheese melted on top via microwave. Not so good, couldn&#39;t even get through it.

I hear that the burgers are good, but my 8 year old said &#34;Portillos is better&#34;... Take that for what it is worth.

Overall, most of the food did not some homemade, and tasted the same.

Don&#39;t think we will be back."

There is a plethora of delicious items and options on their menu. The wings and nachos are a great option and will fill you up. Whether you&#39;re looking for a classic take on the American burger, smoked brisket tacos you&#39;re in luck. Also, if you&#39;re in the mood for just a tasty beverage this is the place. If you&#39;re looking or are in the mood for an amazing/classic variety selection of craft beer on tap and in bottles this is the place. There is a whole list of IPA&#39;s which I really appreciate as a craft beer lover and is a great addition for this town. Finally, I&#39;ve gotten the chance to visit the Range twice in the last couple of months  recently and I am very impressed. The whole dinning room and patio has a new and different feel to it and this place is here to stay. The owner personally comes up and greets the customers to make sure everyone is happy, so it is clear that good customer service is practiced here and the staff genuinely appreciates every customer that walks in. It was cool on both occasions to see how passionate the staff was about the Range and had different suggestions on what beers and food to order. Everyone had their favorite item on the menu!!!  Also, the owner has worked very hard and dedicated a lot of time and hours to  make sure that everyone working here is doing their best job possible, including removing one of the weekday daytime servers/bartenders who just wasn&#39;t performing and needed to leave. So all in all, I had a great experience and got great service each time, so...whether you plan to seek the next frequent after work drink and dinner or you go out occasionally like myself, put the Range on your list, as iti is now on the map in the great city of Batavia, the City of Energy."

I&#39;ve enjoyed the brisket and brisket sandwich, and the Friday fish fry, but the baby back ribs are my current favorite. (I&#39;ve yet to try the pizza). 
The ribs come in a one-pound portion, with the option for two pounds. I know baby backs are often served as half- or full-racks. My estimation is that the one pound is more than a half rack.  I think I counted 8 bones. Meaty, juicy and flavorful, I was able to clean the meat from the ribs with just my fork. The entree comes with the choice of two sides, and I chose a dinner salad, nicely done, and an ample serving of sweet potato fries. I&#39;m a big guy, and a big eater, but I walked away from the single pound dinner fully satisfied."

The parking lot is just stupid. Do yourself a favor and park on the street and walk. 

As we neared the front of the restaurant we could smell the food and being that we were ALL starving, we made our way in quickly....to an empty restaurant. I thought maybe they were closed. Seriously...where are all the people? The scarecrow fest, maybe? Did we come at a weird time? Maybe. We can&#39;t just leave, so we took a seat but not before using the ladies room. Which I have to say is just weird...its like they took several rooms and put them together, the door frame isn&#39;t finished and there are openings near the floorboards, the soap dispenser is broken and the light is flickering like we were in a fun house...I was so weirded out for a minute! My sister and I just laughed it off and joined the boys at a large table in the bar area where they could see whatever game was on that day.

The server was honest in her opinions, which I normally appreciate but she wasn&#39;t really selling us on anything in the menu, so I was kinda turned off. My sister asked how the crab cakes were and she said &#39;kinda mushy&#39; and &#39;not what you would expect&#39;. Needless to say, she chose something else on the menu. The server did recommend the tempura zucchini which is technically a &#39;side&#39; option but she said it also worked as an appetizer if we wanted to try it, so we did. For $3, it was great! Only issue was that it was greasy..it needed more time to, I don&#39;t know, drain? 

My self and my brother-in-law copied each other and both ordered the beef brisket. It was VERY fatty, but it was VERY good. It basically fell apart so it was easy to get the meat and cut off the fat. I ordered the waffle fries and their chili. The chili was my favorite thing of the whole meal. I would go back for the chili alone. The waffle fries left something to be desired. My husband&#39;s meal came with the wrong side so after waiting a while and him getting further and further into in steak sandwich without being able to enjoy his side along with it, we had to get up to find the missing server to have her correct the issue. Everyone else left satisfied, but I got the impression from the birthday girl that she was not a big fan of her dish, so I felt really bad that we ventured out of our safe zone restaurants on her birthday.

He loves the baked fish fry on Friday nights. The brisket poppers are amazing. The brisket can&#39;t be beat and the ribs can&#39;t be beat either. Andrea is a top notch server! Great burgers and good variety, like the Chicagoan burger with Italian beef. The beignets are hot and fresh. I really could go on and on. This is a must try!!! ..and bring some cash to hit up the popcorn shop across the street afterwards."

The owner was always running around making sure everyone was having an enjoyable experience. I met several friends here Friday night for drinks and appetizers and it was horrendous. Two of us arrived and sat down at the table with one of our friends already sitting and drinking a beer. We sat and talked waiting for a waitress for 10 minutes to no avail.  Being thirsty at 7:30 on a Friday night I went to the bar to grab us a couple beers.  The first two drafts I order in told thy are out of with no replacement tapped.  Kind of odd. I ask what they have in bottles and the bartender ( who was a very nice woman) had no idea and said she doesn&#39;t know anything about beer. I finally look in the cooler myself and grab a couple beers.  I go back to the table to find the waitress now a good 20 minutes into our arrival still hasn&#39;t stopped by!  Fast forward 4 more friends arrive and sit and yep you guessed it had to go to the bar to grab beers after waiting 10 minutes.  Finally waitress comes over and we place food and at this point second drink orders.  It took her 20 minutes to bring back beers and she&#39;s brought back some attitude as well.  I was wondering where the hands on owner was and found out from another disgruntled patron that he was basically fired and bought out. Shame whoever is running it now has absolutely no clue what they are doing. I have to say quite possibly the worst service I&#39;ve ever had ever!

So my grade is incomplete, and based only on the beer menu (with an alluring dining tip from my neighbor).

Getting on to the beer then ~
The beer menu is above average, mixing a nice variety of microbrews with your every day redneck delights (MGD, Coors, Bud products).  Open Range was smart to add  these duds to the menu though, so they could please every type of beer drinker that walked through the door (even those without tastebuds).  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about every craft on their list, whether or not they had it in stock, what each beer was composed of and an honest opinion about each.  Given that their menu is around 75 beers deep, that&#39;s impressive.  The menu also shows the Style, ABV and BAS score for each beer.  That&#39;s a classy touch.  And lastly, the best part..their prices are decent, especially compared to many local spots vending microbrews.  Head over to Geneva and you&#39;ll definitely pay $1.50-$4 more per bottle.

My neighbors tip on the food was to try the prime rub, which he said was a mere $15 and phenomenal.  I also took a gander at the food menu and look forward to making a second trip with the fam.

Nice job Open Range.  This is a ten fold improvement over the dive that used to hold up the same roof.

Cheers."

But they do want to come to dinner with us, and suggested Open Range as nearby and suitably tasty.

This place is not super-obvious in downtown Batavia; the sign is kinda small and the street not terribly well-lit, plus there&#39;s roadwork right now. They have a small lot but there&#39;s a bigger one across the street. 

I didn&#39;t get a great grasp of the restaurant layout, but there were at least two rooms, one more &#34;dining&#34; and one with a bar. We were seated in the dining area at a longish table. 

The menu is slightly classed-up bar food -- burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, salads. They also have a pretty good craft beer list. I would say though that the layout of both is slightly confusing. The menu has one sandwich section with some burgers, and then another page with only burgers, with longer descriptions and pictures. The beer menu has one column with style/ABV/price and a second, mis-matched from the first, with the Beer Advocate rating. Weird.

That said, overall, both menus looked good once you could figure out how to read them.

Our orders were taken pretty promptly. I went for a Tumbleweed burger (bacon, queso, fried onion straws and a fried egg plus some kinda sauce), tempura zucchini as a side and an Ace Honey Cider to drink. I like that you have a variety of sides to choose from, and they&#39;re all the same price -- onion rings, zucchini, fries, salad, mashed potatoes and a few others. 

My burger was very good, and pretty messy. I ordered it medium but I think it was more like medium well. The egg yolk dripped all over as did the queso but it was a delicious mess. 

A few notes that keep it from being five stars for me:

-- No glasses were offered for bottled beer. Every beer snob knows you need a glass to really experience the full flavor of your beverage.

-- Water refills were sporadic.

-- Waitress did a great job with separate checks, but then there was some sort of weird thing with mine, she claimed she had run the wrong bill on my card, but I immediately looked at my credit card app, and there was the original charge, a refund for it, and then the same exact charge (which was correct, based on my math) ... it was strange. 

The atmosphere was sort of odd, too, they clearly are going for a little bit nicer food menu but it reads like a bar through and through. 

Still, I would definitely come back for the creative food menu and good beer list."

Okay I&#39;ll extend that to the western suburbs, because there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going anywhere else with these so close. I usually go in wanting to try something new, but land on a burger because they&#39;re just that good. Honkey Tonk is delicious, but I had to break up with it when I met the Range Burger. Something about the chipotle mayo that goes on the top. Speaking of, the brisket poppers are the best! Always cooked well, crispy on the outside with a nice melty cheesy center with brisket inside, promptly dunked in chipotle sauce and shoveled into your mouth. Fiance and I can&#39;t go and not split an order. We&#39;ve tried. It doesn&#39;t work. Great beer selection, the owner Jeremy really knows his stuff in this area. Pizza is also a good option, though we tend to order it well done because they come out just a pinch under what we&#39;d prefer sometimes. Overall, we keep going back. Especially in the summer, the big screened in porch is absolute heaven with a beer in your hand."

Our table ordered 3 burgers, 1 pulled pork sandwich and a tenderloin sandwich.  My pulled pork was ok; it tasted good, but it was barely lukewarm, as were the sweet potato fries.  Others seemed to have similar complaints about the temperature of their burgers, as well as that their burgers were dry.  My husband&#39;s burger was missing the bacon advertised.  The tenderloin sandwich appeared to be made with skirt steak instead of the tenderloin as advertised.  

I will say, our waitress was friendly but not too attentive; I don&#39;t recall being asked how our meal was at all, and our drinks weren&#39;t refilled like they tend to be at other places.  I would like to give this place another try; I&#39;m really hoping they simply had an off night...."

We would recommend nachos without the cheese sauce (leaving just shredded cheese). 

My wife&#39;s fajitas were good but overlooked. My pulled pork sandwich was more like chopped pork (which was ok). Onion straws are really good. 

Not a place to crave but it does the trick. 

One note... This is somehow related to Open Range in Sugar Grove. The food is very close to the same, but we have been to Open Range many times and the food was always better than what we experienced here. We would drive a little further to go to Open Range in the future."

However, twice now I have tried the brisket and twice I have been disappointed. This time around I had the brisket tacos. Both the tortillas and brisket were dry and just not tasty. Even the sauce it comes with couldn&#39;t save it. 

We also tried the pretzel nuggets appetizer. The nuggets were pretty good, although a few were dry and doughy. The disappointment here was with the beer cheese sauce it came with, which was just nasty. It was almost rancid tasting. I&#39;m not sure who would enjoy such a sauce. I love beer, and I love cheese, but that combo was not good at all. Thankfully our server was able to bring us a queso cheese instead, which, although it was runny, was a vast improvement.

Others at the table had ribs, which I sampled and enjoyed. The sauce had a nice smokey sweetness. The pizza was also good, not great.

What might get me to come back is the huge beer menu, which is extensive and eclectic. Our server Tyler was attentive and friendly."

The food is great, the prices are good, the beer selection is good...great place to bring the family, watch a game, drink some beers, and mingle with the staff (because they are really nice!). It&#39;s located in downtown Batavia, so you can enjoy a nice stroll before or after your meal. You might need a stroll or two or ten after eating some of their delicious, hearty food.

I&#39;ll admit...the service when we went was a bit slow. But we were in a group of about 12, so its to be somewhat expected. There was a half-off pizza deal going on, but apparently they ran out of pizza dough, so we couldn&#39;t order that anymore. It happens, right? Well they felt bad for the people wanting to order pizza and still took part of the check off anyway. That was super of them! 

The brisket I ordered was fab. You got a good amount of it and it was charred just enough. I ordered it with grilled veggies and roasted corn/queso. The grilled veggies were a little cold, but seasoned well enough to make it forgivable. Corn and queso, DEFINITELY good.

Let&#39;s take a step back for a second and talk about this menu. If you go to their website, you can look up what you are ordering and see a REAL picture of what you want. It&#39;s all mouthwatering and doesn&#39;t look like fake staged fast food pictures. The nachos picture has those imperfections that nachos tend to have...cheese falling off the plate, olives not evenly distributed, an interesting shape of sour cream...this is real life nachos, and they look heavenly. But then continue to scroll down, and you can see the best-looking burgers and sandwiches this side of the Rio Grande. 
The Honky Tonk Burger, with an egg, queso, and onion straws. 
The Kansas City Burger, with pulled pork, onion straws, coleslaw, and cheese. 
The Beef Brisket and Famous Pulled Pork Sandwiches, all piled high with their slow-cooked meats.
COME.ON. HOW AM I NOT SUPPOSED TO WANT EVERYTHING?
It doesn&#39;t even end there. Take a look at their enormous, cheesy Range Burrito. It comes in a skillet because it can&#39;t contain all the flavors literally falling out of it. Or the Smoked Brisket Tacos...this has gotta be the best picture on the website. 
Top it all off? Bacon Maple Donut Holes. I&#39;m done. Peace out. I can&#39;t handle this menu anymore. I&#39;m fatter just by reading it. It all sounds delicious.

Do you want to go there yet? No? Are you dead? Is your heart even beating? Because this place looks and sounds delicious, all things considered...and you should consider your life choices if you aren&#39;t making immediate plans to go there and try something with queso sauce on it (because more than half the menu comes with queso)."

They had a new bartender and she had NO business being behind the bar. She got my wine wrong, my food order wrong, I saw her screw up 3 other drink orders and she didn&#39;t know how to use a corkscrew!  Puleez! Before you put someone behind a bar, should you ask if they have ever eaten in a restaurant or sat at a bar? Ugh, just plain AWFUL service!!!  The wrap was okay, nothing special.

The residents of Batavia want so badly to support local buisiness. &#34;Give us good food at a fair price&#34;. This place is on targer to do just that!  

Sooo many local restaurants over the years have failed to figure this out, particularly in the building currently occupied by open range....hopefully the pattern is broken.

As I said, good food with an interesting menu offering &#34;just enough&#34; options to choose from. All said, just the opposite, as the beer menu offers extensive options to meet your needs....PBR&#39;s to Micro Brews. Well done!

I saved the best for last! The bar area also has several tables to dine as well. This area supports a glass partition between the bar and dining area. This is great. You have an open view of the entire restaurant and a sound barrier from youngster roguish rascals &#34;doin&#39; their thing&#34;. 

Just sayin&#39;.... Great place!"

You think you are getting a normal priced pizza because the fine print at the top of the page and not by the acc pizza I ordered had an up garage. They messed up the order for my pizza and the server said &#34;since Monday is normally buy one get one free pizza night you can give it to you today even tho it&#39;s Sunday&#34;. He tried to make me feel like that I was lucky to get the pizza I acc ordered. 

I ordered w beer on tap. I thought it looked flat no head or anything. I tasted it and it was flat. I told the bartender and he said ohh it must be empty then I had to ask for a diff beer. 

I found a misprint on the beer list/menu. I thought the beer I ordered was $4.50 that&#39;s what it said on the beer list then I saw on the menu it said $5.50. I asked the bartender what the price was. He said let me check went to the manager or owner then he came back and said its been debunked. And the beer list price is the old price when it was in cans and the menu price is now that it&#39;s on tap. They didn&#39;t give it to me for the price I thought I was paying somehow they charged me $5.15 a beer?! So confusing, I just paid it. 

All in all a good local bar but make sure you read the menu carefully and maybe even be prepared to pay more. 

Also why no deals on Sundays for football?"

Is very convenient and I like to support our local businesses.   They&#39;d been posting photos on their website and the food looked amazing.  

I went with my husband and son on a Friday evening.  We were seated right away.  From there it took 10 minutes to get a server and another 20 for our beers.  I was worried but from that point on the service was excellent. In all fairness, there was a very large party that appeared to have been seated not long before us. 

We went in on a Friday specifically for the fish fry. My husband ordered the fried fish which came with waffle fries, green beans and his choice of soup or salad.  He had the chicken tortilla soup which I tried.  It was a creamy base and was quite good.  My son ordered the kids cheese pizza.  He ate nearly all of it and enjoyed it.  I ordered the crab cakes.  The three nice sized crab cakes came with really yummy garlic Parmesan mashed potatoes and incredible tempura zucchini.   The cab cakes were so big I ended up bringing home some of my dinner.  

The owner comped us dessert that visit. We had the beignets with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce.  I am not big on dessert unless its out of the ordinary.  This was amazing.  Get the beignets if you come here. 

The beer selection is crazy big.  They had a favorite IPA of mine that&#39;s not easy to find so I was happy.  

I cannot wait to visit again soon!"

If you can get past the outside looking like a shanty, the wood paneling on the walls, and the decade old carpet...this place is a great hidden gem. 
Last night I ventured there for a quick meal and a microbrew. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by how courteous the staff was, the waitress more attentive to our needs than many high scale restraints I frequent. 
The beer selection is astounding to say the least. There also is a wine selection,but I highly recommend a micro brew, even for the palate of the most sophisticated wine snob.
Pretzels and cheese was mediocre, I actually would not order again. The pretzels were hard and the cheese dip thin and over spicy.
I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was mouth watering. The right combination of pork and BBQ sauce on a crusty roll. I would have liked more slaw on the sandwich along with a few more crunchy onion straws, but this is definitely worth ordering again.
The burgers were very appealing and large! 
The bar is nicely sanctioned off and not overly loud, even on a Saturday night.
Good work Open Range. I will be back!"

The food was great, the staff was very friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is laid back and welcoming. It was the perfect day to sit out on the covered patio.

I ordered a  Southwest Salad, and was delightfully impressed at how the flavors worked together. The steak in the salad was nice, and tender.

We rode our bikes to Open Range thinking that we would get a burger and a beer.  What I didn&#39;t expect was a huge microbrew selection (like the Ale House in Geneva) at incredibly reasonable prices.  I had a Dogfish Head 60 min IPA for $4.50.  My wife had a Matilda for $5.50.  If you&#39;re a beer drinker, you know that those prices are near some places&#39; bud light drafts.  It was awesome to have such an extensive beer selection at affordable prices!  

The food was very good.  I had a pulled pork.  Wife had the brisquet.  Very good.  And, the burger choices, which we do didn&#39;t try looked great.

Finally, the service was very good.  The waitress let my wife try a sampler of the Burbon Ale (which she found out wasn&#39;t for her).  I&#39;ll contrast this with an experience I had at the Ale House in Geneva where we paid for a three glass sampler, and my wife just hated one of the beers.  When we asked, the waitress said that she could not replace the sampler and we&#39;d have to pay 1/3 of the sampler price to get a new one. Since we were very loyal customers at the Ale House and have spent hundreds there, this was off-putting.  Whatever.  the Open Range server we had was friendly, prompt, and accommodating!"

Walking, especially in summer is just very nice. However, we made an exception last night and broadened our horizons all the way to Batavia for my birthday.
Once I went to the correct side of the river (for reference, it&#39;s the west side) we parked right in front.  I imagine if they are super busy, you would park across the street in the public lot as there were only 4-5 spaces right in front. 
Upon walking up, I was impressed with the outdoor seating area.  Finally someone with a place near the river has figured out to but up screening to keep the river monsters, I mean gnats, out of your food.  Score 1 for Open Range.  
We were seated by the host who also ended up being our server.  Nice guy, quick with suggestions and to bring an emergency plate of chips and guacamole to our &#34;starving&#34; 12 year old.  
Bonus for Wednesdays:  1/2 price apps, deserts and BOTTLES OF WINE.  Wines are mostly ones we&#39;ve heard of so we went with the Mark West Pinot.  
We ordered the filet sliders for the girls and crab cakes for us for apps.  Both were fantastic.  I was especially happy that one girl was sick and didn&#39;t want to eat so I got some slider too.  Very tender filet style sliders with onion strings.  Yum.
The crab cakes were good too, although I&#39;m spoiled having lived with Maryland crab cakes for years.
The one girl sick precipitated us getting our orders to go.  One kid did a cheese pizza, wifey did the mahi mahi fish tacos with grilled veggies and I went full carnivore on the brisket with the rize and queso side.  
All were very good. My brisket was melt in the mouth with a little bit of smokiness.  Fish tacos were firm but tender (I think that&#39;s possible) and the cheese pizza was flavorful (disclaimer: I ate it for breakfast this morning, but it was still good).
Let me get to the best part:  the beer list.  I can&#39;t remember the name, but I had a Kentucky Bourbon based draft and it was one of my favorite beers ever.  So good.  Bonus for being 8.1% ABV too.  They had a bunch of craft beers on the menu, I think the server said 70+.  Mama&#39;s Little Yellow Pils and Dale&#39;s Pale Ale being two of my go-tos were prominently featured.
Finally, we did desert as it was my birthday.  How about bacon filled donuts with powdered sugar and maple syrup for dipping?  2 please.  Decadent yes.
Overall we enjoyed it.  Decor was kind of northwoods lodge meets a bit more upscale bistro.  Pleasant enough.  
Thanks for a great birthday meal!"

We decided to give the place a shot after seeing some positive reviews.  My friend and co-conspirator also thought it would be a nice salad/pizza/wine/dessert night.  The server was attentive, and didn&#39;t mind when we retreated from the dining room to the more adult environment of a bar side hi top after a large group with many youngsters tumbled in.

Side salads were nice - fresh spring greens and generously portioned.  Wine list was adequate for the venue and reasonably priced.

But - the pizza.  

A nice layer of decent cheese, good Italian sausage, a slightly too-sweet-for-me sauce atop a burnt crust that I strongly suspect is a shipped-in item.  Not too burnt to be inedible...but right on the cusp.  (And we were, quite frankly - way too hungry to wait for a do-over.)  I mentioned the crust to the server, and the manager on duty stopped over at our table.  Really nice guy - and he comped our dessert for the pizza fail.

But - the dessert.

A lovely portion of beignets, big enough to share, drizzled with chocolate syrup, (per our request), with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream in the center.  Pretty to look at, and - upon first taste - rich and delicious.  Only...they&#39;re supposed to be cooked all the way through.  The centers were raw dough.  Once again, we finished without requesting a redo.  A little bit of raw dough won&#39;t kill me, (so far). 

Maybe we&#39;ll try them again some other time.

And - then again - maybe not.

I&#39;m somewhere between overcooked and underdone with my decision."

Someone needs to start checking the orders before they go out. It has gotten to the point that we don&#39;t want to order from here anymore because who knows if what we order we actually get delivered. It&#39;s a damn shame too. 

What I like the most about this place is the variety. Moretti&#39;s has a lot to offer and that&#39;s a real plus when you want to do delivery and want more then pizza. I&#39;ve been ordering from Moretti&#39;s for years and  here are some of the best dishes I&#39;ve had here that you should try. 

The deep dish cheese pizza. I&#39;m normally not one to order just a plane cheese pizza but they use a blend of cheeses that makes this one of the best cheese pizzas I&#39;ve ever had. Better than Lou Malnattis and Gino&#39;s East. 

Their chicken Parmesan sandwich and Dinner are excellent. The sandwich comes with two chicken breasts and the dinner comes with three. Great value. 

The fried calamari- I ask for it with marinara though. It comes with cocktail sauce. 

Any of their pasta dishes are great

Last would be if you get a sandwich, instead of fries get their chips. Super crunchy and just the right amount of salt. 

Only reason I didn&#39;t go 5 stars is because they aren&#39;t always consistent in the quality of their food."

She was nice but seemed irritated when we asked about sitting at some tables that were empty. 

Waitress: Great! 

Food: Kids made their own pizza which was fun and they said it was good.  They also say Little Caesars is good pizza so I wouldn&#39;t take their opinion for much. 
Sunday was spaghetti night and the spaghetti was good and enough for 2 adults to split. I came here to have a Chicago style deep dish and was pretty disappointed with it.  The sauce was bland like they just opened a can of crushed tomatoes and dumped it on top.  There wasn&#39;t much cheese and all I could taste was the sausage which was ok.  Next time I&#39;m back visiting family I&#39;ll stick to Lou&#39;s or Rosatis."

I regularly get orders that are wrong.  Order one salad no onion, every salad has no onions.  Wrong dressing.  Missing dressing.  Missing utensils.  Missing bread.  Seriously, what is wrong with their take-out staff?

Would rate higher if not for the bad service.  Eggplant parm. there (sandwich and entree) is the best I&#39;ve had.  Pizzas are very good.  Dine-in service is slow and just about as bad as take-out service.

I&#39;ve ordered from Moretti&#39;s probably a triple-digit number of times, and I think part of the problem leading to their wrong orders is the fact that they have multiple people bag up (at least) take-out orders.  One person puts in soups, another puts in condiments and utensils, etc.  You can see it happening as you wait for the order.  Have one person bag things up, and I suspect this would be far less of a problem.

Edit: On second thought, probably would leave three stars even if the service were better.  Food is about as inconsistent as the correctness of the orders.  Have had some soups that were perfect and others that were salty to the point of being borderline inedible."

The food has proven to be consistently inconsistent in portions and quality, but you can never go wrong with their mac and cheese pizza. It&#39;s seriously so good. If you&#39;re going to visit Moretti&#39;s one time and order one thing, get their mac and cheese pizza (add the stuffed Asiago crust for $4 extra for even more cheesy goodness). But this is a treat that I&#39;ve only permitted myself to twice; of course, it&#39;s a heavy dish, and it&#39;s on the pricier side. Coming close to $30 for a large pizza, regardless of whether it&#39;s a speciality pizza or not, is rather excessive. You&#39;ll definitely have leftovers, though! 

Other than the pizza, I always go for the pasta. The gnocchi is a hit or miss; they&#39;ll make it with any sauce you want, but I&#39;ve found the portions to be different with each order. 

The staff has been super friendly every time we&#39;ve phoned in an order. They&#39;ve always been extremely helpful answering questions and assisting us in placing our order, and when we got to be too lazy to drive over to pick it up, they&#39;ll throw in free delivery. 

One thing I have noticed is that for the two times I&#39;ve chosen to dine in, the service has been slow. One time I came in on a Sunday at around 6:00pm, and it was understandably packed. The wait time wasn&#39;t so much of an issue as the lack of attentiveness by our server; he sort of forgot about us. This happened again when we came in on a Thursday night at around 9:00pm, only it was a completely empty restaurant. Our server was aloof, didn&#39;t refill our sodas, and didn&#39;t make occasional trips to the table to see if we needed anything. We didn&#39;t leave the restaurant until 10:30pm; it took that long to get us our food and hunt down the server for our bill. Again, this was a dead restaurant.

Overall, Moretti&#39;s is okay. It&#39;s rather expensive for the portions you get, and the food is a hit or miss. I recommend picking up your order; there&#39;s plenty of coupons online, and the phone workers are always super friendly."

Went in last night at 715pm.  Party of 4.  There were a few people waiting and he took our name.  We went to the bar to wait.  I looked around and there were at least 8 tables open. After 10 min we got the text our table was ready.  They sat us at one of the tables that had been open the entire time.   Our waiter took our order brought our food and then the check.  Those were the only times we saw them.  The food there was generally good but I ordered the lemon chicken and it was not.  Plus it is supposed to come with vegetables and there were only a few skimpy ones on the plate.  I should have taken a picture.  Perhaps just a one off. The other people I was with enjoyed their dinner.

My father and I decided to go for a quick pie to check out the Schaumburg location. 
We used to visit the Bartlett location as we lived in Streamwood. 
However, we moved to Arlington Heights and decided the Schaumburg location was worth a shot. 

We went in on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately in a comfy booth in the bar area. The restaurant was not very packed. (Maybe because it was a Sunday?) 

Our server came over and took our drink and appetizer order. The service was good. (more on that later) 

We ordered the Breaded Calamari. It was fresh, hot, and delicious. 
When it comes to Calamari, it&#39;s all about the flavor/consistency of the &#34;breading&#34;. 
The breading was seasoned perfectly, not overpowering. 
If I had to order one thing off the &#34;Starters&#34; menu, the Calamari would be my choice. 

Next, we ordered the pizza. 
We ordered the &#34;House Favorite&#34; (Sausage, Pepperoni, Onion Green Pepper) and added Spinach and EXTRA cheese. 
Now, I&#39;ll be honest we stopped visiting Moretti&#39;s for years, as they would cheap out on the pizza. (Little to no ingredients, Little Cheese). This visit was our way of giving them a chance to redeem themselves. 

The pizza came out piping hot and looking good. 
We each had a slice and came to the same conclusion. 
What if we didn&#39;t order &#34;extra&#34; cheese?! What would &#34;regular&#34; cheese be? 
We both assumed it would be like eating pizza crust covered in sauce. 
To our disappointment, very little sausage or pepperoni on the pizza. Maybe one little ball of sausage per slice. I&#39;m talking pinkie nail size sausage. However, more onions and green pepper than one could palate.  I guess onions and peppers are cheaper to put on the pizza, instead of sausage or pepperoni. 

Fed up with the pizza, I reluctantly ordered a &#34;mini-dessert&#34;. 
I ordered the &#34;mini&#34; tiramisu. It was the worst excuse for tiramisu. 
The ladyfingers are normally dipped in coffee. Not here, dipped in water and served with warm whipped cream. I was fed up and got the bill. I doubt I&#39;ll return, except for calamari. 

The service was good initially, but went downhill real fast. Our server would routinely disappear for ten minutes at a time, leaving our cups empty. Her tip reflected her absence. 

We finished up our pizza and packed the leftovers to go. 
Needless to say, we were very disappointed in the skimping of ingredients. 
We will most likely not be returning for the pizza, when you skimp, people stop coming. 
(most likely the reason for an almost barren dining area) 
Also, other reviews are right. The delivery drivers drive like animals. 
One almost plowed into us while leaving the parking lot. Then, proceeded to cut other cars off. 

Stop cheaping out on the pizza, or you will be out of business real soon. 
Also, have your waitresses do their job, instead of disappearing every five minutes. 
Get your drivers in line before you seriously injure someone else. 

When they can make a REAL pizza, I&#39;ll be back. 
Until then, I&#39;ll order Tortorice&#39;s pizza, they&#39;re not afraid to PILE it on! 

5- Stars for the Calamari 
1- Star for Everything Else!"

THEN, the entire order is wrong including salads that had allergy restrictions AND the food was cold. When we had called the girl the first time 1 hour and 15 minutes after we placed our order to see where it was... the woman who answered the phone became rude and told us that we were lying about what time she said? We called her on our recorded work line that we replayed just to make sure we heard correctly, which WE DID. Then, she said our order was ready and would be sent immediately, which it then took 30 minutes to arrive. Once it did get here, and was completely incorrect... we called back where she then tried to yell at me about how she was the one who bagged the order and KNOWS that it was correct. I asked her to read the order back to me and sure enough it was ordered correctly and then I tell her what we got upon delivery.... which was completely incorrect. She &#34;corrected the issue&#34; by just telling us that the order would be remade and sent over and hung up the phone. No apology or any sort of empathy for a repeat customer that has spent $1000s of dollars over the years with their company.

Went in last night for 1/2 price pizza Tuesday.  The wait was an hour, which we expected.  What we didn&#39;t expect, was to wait over an hour for a large thin-crust pizza after we ordered it.

We ordered within 10 minutes of being seated (including asking the server to come back a few times because we just weren&#39;t quite sure.)  We ordered:

1 small thin crust pizza with 3 toppings
1 large thin crust pizza with 2.5 toppings
1 large deep dish pizza (the house specialty) - were told it would be 30 minutes, said no problem, just bring the others out when they are ready.
2 appetizer salads.

The salads came right away.  I had a salad that was on special - blanched green beans with tomatoes, red onion, danish bleu cheese, and lemon vinaigrette.  It was actually very good.

Then we waited.  and waited.  and waited.  and waited.

The small pizza came, and we were informed that the kitchen had to re-make the large, because &#34;they forgot the sausage.&#34;  Um... okay?

Then, the deep dish came.

Then, finally, the large thin came.

None of this was the server&#39;s fault... obviously.  She was sweet and kind, and you could see her anxiety over this kitchen fubar.

However, a manager was nowhere to be found.  My dad asked the server to mention to the manager how long the pizza took - hoping, he/she would come over, do something. 

Well, they did something, they took the pizza off the bill.  However, they never did make an appearance to apologize.  

Terrible management at this Moretti&#39;s.  We were there from 6:30 to after 9pm for a couple of pies.  

Ala Carte Entertainment - get your sh*t together and train your managers to manage.  Not hide.  When our server asked the manager to remove the pizza from our check, he/she should have been at our table immediately to apologize, at the very minimum.

And forgetting sausage on a pizza?  Let&#39;s get some training into the kitchen too?"

As soon as we ordered pizza with no appetizer, the service went down.  She brought our food and checked back once.  We had to wait a good ten minutes to get her attention to have the food wrapped and the check.  I had a hard time getting her attention.  The place was not packed.  It had at least 6 vacant tables in our section. She never did come back for the cash. Glad I didn&#39;t pay with a credit card, or I&#39;d still be sitting there.  Finally I left it on the table.

A coworker introduced me to Moretti&#39;s  at lunch. I had the chicken Limon and was in love!  Two tender chicken breasts with a wonderful lemon butter sauce with capers over perfectly done angel hair pasta. I had to bring the leftovers back to my hotel which thankfully had a microwave. The left overs were just as wonderful the next night.   
On my next visit I discovered a whole new world of options by ordering off the paper inserted into the menu that listed the daily specials.  I&#39;ve tried so many amazing items over the last couple months on that daily specials list. I&#39;ve had multiple types of fish dinners, gourmet salads, tender steaks and a variety of other options. Tonight was a 10 oz filet mignon with mushrooms and onions, served with shrimp Diablo &amp; garlic mashed potatoes. I requested that they substitute angel hair pasta for the potatoes and serve the shrimp on top. The filet had a smoky rich flavor  and was butter tender. It was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had! The shrimp were large and flavorful and the Diablo sauce had just the right amount of heat and tomatoes. The price? Ridiculous, only $19!   I have no idea how they can offer such amazing food at such reasonable prices. Most daily special meals are in the $13 - $17 price range. One night I had pan seared kingfish tipped with crab and avocado salad with s side of broccolini. I thought I had died and went to foodie heaven. Perfectly cooked and seasoned and indescribably delicious And it was only $15.99!!  You need to try this place, you will be so glad you did.

But I really prefer the lesser known pizzerias and Moretti&#39;s is definitely my favorite.

The deep dish is what I go for, and although it takes about a half-hour, it&#39;s well worth the wait.  With pizzas, you can choose your own ingredients, or you can choose one of the &#34;Favorite Pizzas.&#34; I generally choose the favorites, and I often order the &#34;Moretti&#39;s BBQ.&#34;  The barbecue sauce blends well with the sausage and cheese for a uniquely tasty and mouthwatering experience.  Moretti&#39;s BBQ deep dish (you can also get a Favorite in thin crust) is what I order most of the time, but the Pizza topped with Mac &amp; Cheese is another tasty and decadent option.  I can&#39;t order that pizza too often, lest I gain a lot of weight.

Service is always wonderful, and there are lots of big screen TVs across the restaurant, so if a game is going on, be ready to join in the shouts with the other patrons when our local team scores.

The pizzas are a little pricier than what you might pay somewhere else, but once you take your first bite, you&#39;ll understand why.  If you&#39;re looking for great pizza, at a place with a great ambience, and great service, Moretti&#39;s is the right place."

The pizza was warm but not hot. After all, there was some nasty weather out there. The pizza was good but not in the upper echelon of pizza in the Chicagoland area.

I have had a variety of things from here - their pizza is great (probably one of my favorite things on their menu), and the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad is my go-to. There is something for everyone on their menu. I love that you can sit outside, they have pretty cheap beer specials, and the service is decent. Oh and their bread is amazing. 

However, I think that the food is a little pricey. I would rather have smaller portions for less money. I can&#39;t tell you how many times people have said that their order was wrong when we have ordered delivery. And even though their pizza is great, it is really expensive. 

So, I would and will come back, but if it wasn&#39;t so close and convenient I&#39;m not sure I would come here as often."

Had a buffalo chicken pizza (after seriously considering the Mac and cheese pizza). Really good sauce with a mixture of blue cheese and buffalo sauce instead of tomato sauce. Cheese was plentiful and the thin crust was the best I&#39;ve had. Not too thin like saltine crackers and some texture and flavor. 

The homemade chips were great as was some of the wraps. Looks like a Fridays or Applebee&#39;s (used to be a Fridays) but not in a bad way. Better food but the good atmosphere."

I like it because when hubby craves pizza the rest of us can still order a different variety of foods. We usually do carry out but have had them deliver too. I saw some reviews regarding service lacking but I&#39;ve dined in once and staff was friendly. The thin crust pizza is good. It can use some more cheese though. Crust is nice n crunchy w texture. Calamari fried was good.  It was a bit soggy because we didn&#39;t have it fresh like dining in and it was a bit too chewy. Still tasty though. Lemon chicken I&#39;ve ordered for my kids who really liked it. Kids also had the spaghetti and meatballs once and they loved it. Said it was better than mine (straight to timeout!!) jk. The chicken breasts were not dry at all. The wild rice we weren&#39;t crazy about. I&#39;ve had a few of their salads too. All were great. I like this place in that it has a very good selection of pretty quality meals. It&#39;s also a big plus that they deliver. It&#39;s a solid 3.5 but Yelp doesn&#39;t do .5&#39;s so...

However I do have complaint with their pizza delivery drivers;

Warn your duffus pizza delivery drivers about not trying to intimidate customers with their aggressive driving antics.  We have right to walk in our own neighborhood, even after dark.  Their aggressive driving is not good for your business. 

You had two drivers this evening in plum grove creek area 7pm, Friday, 2-13-15;.  
The first courtesly hit the brights, saw me and and slowed down.  The other idiot driver never slowed or even moved to the center of the road, I finally held my arm straight out to force him/her over to the middle.  He/she knows what they did, I wished he would have pulled into a driveway near me, we would have had a discussion right then and there.

I eat at your restaurant at least once every 2 weeks, I&#39;m a customer who doesn&#39;t care for your fools driving aggressively on our community streets, they have no right away superior to a pedestrian.  Do they not know they have a big lighted Moretti sign on the top of their car advertising who they work for, that in itself is an indicator of how dumb they are.  Have you checked their driving history/records before putting them out there (negligence)?  

I could have a easily called the police and made it really difficult for Moretti&#39;s, however I&#39;ll leave that up to you the mgmt to address.  Next time I&#39;ll take the license plate down and call the police."

HOWEVER. I had a terrible day. Power went out at my hotel, we got moved to the Best Western, I was in a conference until after 10pm and I was starving. I asked the girl at the counter for some menus.  I called the first place, their oven was broken. Second place was snotty when I didn&#39;t know the street address for the hotel (I mean, it&#39;s the nearest best western, is that difficult?), and then I called Morettis, which I could practically see from my room.  Although it was close to their closing time, they were friendly on the phone and when I asked what would be fastest they said anything would be quick.  I got some kind of meat lovers and onion pizza, fries, and soda.  They were super quick, the pizza was artery-clogging heaven, and it was HOT and fresh.  

I felt like the price was reasonable and the delivery guy was polite.  I can&#39;t think of anything that would have made it better!"

Slow initial service, entre arrived too soon after we were served our soup, Lasagna way too salty. I doubt I&#39;d return.

We had reservations and we were promptly seated, though I had to reposition the table so we actually had room for the five of us to sit at the table, for some reason it was very congested where we were seated.  

We waited more than 10 minutes for a waiter to appear at our table.  There were a number of empty tables that evening so I can&#39;t imagine they were too busy. 

A stiff string was found in one of the bowls of clam chowder, when we asked what we were looking at the waiter said it was a &#34;stem&#34; and later explained it was the string used to tie the thyme together, either way not really edible and we were not offered another bowl or any apology.

The entries arrived well before we&#39;d completed our soup and to my dismay the Lasagna I ordered had far more salt added for my taste. The other entries ordered were well received and enjoyed.

Nice atmosphere, not too loud, oodles of televisions, refills were prompt and the service for the remainder of the meal was quite good."

The calamari was surprisingly good. It is large and I could have stopped here.

It&#39;s so good. 

I can&#39;t say that my review is totally fair. I&#39;ve never even eaten in the restaurant. I used to frequent the bar when I lived closer by. We&#39;d go with a group of friends and hang out in the bar for a few hours, and sing (listen to) karaoke. But, the restaurant part was always busy. So, while here, we always used to order food at the bar and it was always really good. We usually got the pizza.

Service is usually fairly good, obviously it depends on who you get. Restaurant is nice and clean. It&#39;s definitely worth a stop. And considering this is just a local little restaurant, and the # of reviews it has - that should tell you something. LOTS of people like to come here.

It&#39;s always nice to come back and try their food!

We started off with yummy bread (which I had to ask the server for as she walked by). Usually, the server brings it to you with every meal... My fiance got the Parmesan Crusted Salmon ($15.99), I got the Gnocchi A La Vodka ($11.99), and we also got a Parmesan Crusted Salmon to go for my father.

The Parmesan Crusted Salmon was yummy as always! However, the portion has definitely gotten a lot smaller than we remember! 

My Gnocchi A La Vodka was delicious as well! It had arugula, tomatoes, and delicious sauce! However, the portion was much smaller than I expected.

I got a call from my parents later, asking if we gave them our leftover salmon. They said the salmon serving looks like a half serving and that they thought we gave them leftovers. =/ I wish I looked at it before I gave it to them.

The service was pretty bad too. The waitress started off nice but then NEVER came to check on us after she took our order. She walked past us literally 5 times and I had to scream &#34;excuse me!&#34; and ask for something. every. single. time.

On average, I order out for pizza twice a year. It&#39;s not very often, so I like for when it to be spectacular when it happens. And as you may have guessed from my succinct opening, Moretti&#39;s just didn&#39;t do it. 

The pizza I ordered was simple, but something that I feel is a good test as far as judging a pie. Any pizza can be delicious with juicy, salty pepperoni, it&#39;s like the miracle all-spice for pizza, but mushroom and black olive- well, that takes talent. 

Our pizza was lacking flavor in crust and our sauce was rather watery, when it was even present. The toppings were pretty sparse and at $5 for 2 extra toppings that were hard to taste amongst all the average. I found myself raiding the spice rack for anything to add for more zest. A bit of oregano and a cornucopia of crushed red pepper would have done wonders for this semi-downer, sub-par pie. 

I would like to note that we picked up for take out and didn&#39;t get the full Moretti&#39;s experience, but the inside dining area did look fun and like a good gathering place/respite from Woodfield Mall."

Quick service / cooking and good prices (especially the Mt Prospect location) are definite pluses but it is sometimes inconsistent with the cooking.

When the bread comes freshly out of the oven it has a nice chewy inside with a nice crispy skin. This goes great with the bruschetta which is pretty good but is a bit pricey (except for when you get 4 - 6 pm half price appetizers) for what you get. The soup here is okay but better than what you&#39;d get at most comparable restaurants.

I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the specialty pasta here. Seemed a bit heavy flavored for me although Biaggi&#39;s also puts too much sauce or salt in their pastas as well. The simple pastas that come with entrees such as sea bass (flaky) or eggplant (amazing) are done fairly well.

The burgers are surprisingly good here, both the cheese and Jack Daniels burger. I hope you&#39;re hungry because they are generously sized and come with a choice of fries or chips (homemade, take this choice!). The wraps are pretty good as well although the Italian beef isn&#39;t that impressive. You can go to Johnnie&#39;s Beef or Portillos nearby to get your fix.

The $2 desserts are not as small as you&#39;d think they are. I enjoyed the cannoli dip although the carrot cake and tiramisu are a notch above. I especially love how strong the expresso flavor came through in the tiramisu."

We all have our favorites, of course, so I felt a little like Benedict Arnold when I eschewed my folks&#39; favorite &#39;za delivery in favor of Moretti&#39;s. But hey, if ordering this delicious pizza is wrong, I sure as hell don&#39;t want to be right.

Let&#39;s get down to brass tacks:

1) Service: 4/5: The nice lady on the phone was a bit confused, directionally, but once she figured out that I was on the East side of Schaumburg, order &amp; delivery were in motion. That being said, I&#39;m not sure they deliver to the West side...perhaps they should put clearer delivery boundaries on the website.

2) Pizza: 4/5: Solid. Nice neutral sauce with just a touch of sweetness and tang, right amount of cheese and a crispy thin crust. It was the perfect vessel for lots of crushed red pepper. I would speculate that the 12&#34; can feed two hungry people, but, hey, I have no idea how much pizza you prefer to consume. Leftovers were just as tasty.

3) Bruschetta: 5/5: Sweet Jesus, this is some delightful bruschetta. Little toasted slices of country bread topped with deliciously garlic-y, basil chopped tomatoes and covered with a hefty slab o&#39; buffalo mozzarella. Get some and try to share, if you can. If I remember correctly, there are 4 pieces to the order. 

4) Value: 4/5: While you can clearly read that I enjoyed said meal, $22 for a 12&#34; pizza an bruschetta seemed a tad pricey. Nevertheless, next time I shall take a moment on Moretti&#39;s website and printing a coupon or two before calling. The only thing better than a delicious meal, is a delicious discounted meal.

Have I found my new pizza delivery fave in Schaumburg...I think so!"

Do yourself a favor &amp; get it with a side of their ranch dressing...seriously amazing. You&#39;re welcome.  I should also mention that I prefer the Edison Park location both for food &amp; service.

The problem I have with both locations however, is that they seem to only hire female bartenders and, apparently the ones with either the least amount of experience or the ones with the least amount of customer service. Maybe just the dumbest they can find? As a female myself, I&#39;m comfortable enough to grab a quick drink/bite by myself at the bar. I&#39;m friendly and also industry. My point? I&#39;m easy, know what I want and tip generously.  

Every time I come to the Schaumburg location, I get some twit bartender who  doesn&#39;t seem to see me/remember I&#39;m there. It takes forever to greet me as I watch her make sure that EVERY guy at the bar is checked in on, joked with, (read flirted with). She will avoid me until I literally have to call her over to get a menu, a drink, a refill...u name it. It doesn&#39;t matter which female bartender. So...wtf...you&#39;re right...I don&#39;t want to sleep with you and I&#39;m not going to pay you and your baby&#39;s way in this life, but I&#39;m pretty easy to take care of and I will tip you. So pleeeeeaaaase stop ignoring the women at your bar.  Greet EVERYONE within one minute...isn&#39;t that written somewhere?  

I will never go to the Schaumburg location again because 5 or 6 times of this nonsense is too much. I tried to give them a chance, but your twit bartenders suck."

I get to say that because I&#39;m the Duke of this place. If you&#39;ve got a problem with that, then check in here and take it away from this audacious Arizonan. 

But NOT before you chow down on what I feel is some of the best thin-crust pizza I&#39;ve ever had. Seriously, just bursting with flavor. That crust is amazing. That sauce is top-notch. They&#39;re not too stingy with the toppings, either. If you&#39;re feeling brave, go for the mac &#39;n&#39; cheese. The asiago crust is also decent, and the deep dish will do, but that thin crust is where it&#39;s at.

Don&#39;t forget to check out some of the adventurous appetizers. Skip the mozzarella sticks and go for some stuffed mushrooms. You&#39;ll thank me later. They have a good weekday happy hour on those, and on Tuesday nights, they have HALF OFF ALL PIZZAS. 

Delicious...almost as delicious as watching your puny team choke in overtime. I&#39;m sitting back at home laughing at how easily we&#39;ll cruise through the first round. But if it&#39;s any consolation, a round of pizza and beer at Moretti&#39;s is so good it might mask the bitter taste of defeat."

Definitely one of the better restaurants in the burbs. Atmosphere was also quite nice and spacious with various different seating areas and plentiful TV screens. 

Place is definitely known for their pizza and had a variety of toppings including italian beef and giardiniera (must try next time). Had their bruschetta to start which was very good. I had the mushroom risotto. While not bad, next time I would stick to pizza. The rice was well done and not al dente. There was nice flavor and mushrooms were plentiful that included about 3 different types. It was a tad saucy and salty for me. My bf ordered the special of a chicken pasta dish (forgot the exact name). However, our waitress put in the wrong order and got him the other special of fish and shrimp. She apologized and my bf chose to stick with this dish and she assured us there would be a discount, as it was her mistake. When our check came, we were very surprised to find that my bf&#39;s meal was completely comped. It would have been more than enough to have charged us the price of the chicken dish (as it was less than the fish/shrimp) but it was free! That is great service. Would come back again, but likely will stick to pizza.

What was a somewhat setback (though understandable) for me was that while it was nice for them to explicitly state this in their menus, they use pre-made Barilla pasta in their dishes."

About 40 minutes later it was already at my door! I was impressed even before tasting the goodness that is Moretti&#39;s pizza. This pizza is by far the best in Schaumburg (having lived in the area my entire life) It is perfectly thin and crispy and the sausage and pepperoni were phenomenal.

We tried a second time and succeeded this time. We ordered a large pizza and chicken parm meal and it was $35. I was taken aback by the price. The chicken parm was average at best. The pizza has potential but it was lacking sauce that I had to stop eating it.

I just can&#39;t give a five star review because their prices are a little outrageous- you&#39;ll easily pay well over $20.00 for a pizza that&#39;s very good, but you can get better for a lot cheaper. It&#39;s a very good thin crust pizza, could definitely be a little bit crunchier. Everything else I&#39;ve tried has been fantastic- they have a delicious chicken wrap and a cannoli dessert that you dip pieces of cannoli into a mascarpone cream dip- yum! They have a nice patio, but not a lot of good drink specials. Good ambiance inside, but I think they&#39;d do a lot better if they made the prices more reasonable and improved the drink specials. The only reason I would go there that is unique is the pizza and I&#39;ve already found a place nearby that is much cheaper."

We waited and waited for the bartender to come by to order our next round. She was too busy talking to her two friends at the bar. 

We actually tried to get her attention by calling to one of her friends as the bartender  was completely unaware of our attempts to get her attention. The bartender was so involved with one of the two friends. 

When she finally came by she looked at us wondering if we needed another drink. When we said yes somewhat rudely, she proceeded to tell us she just came by 13 minutes ago. WTH!

I had email proof of reservation but the private room was booked by someone else already. After 30 minutes of going back and forth they finally accommodated us with seating in the dinning room. Manger did honor original pricing quoted but no other compensation was offered. When we asked for additional discounts for the mixup and hassle we were met with resistance and they did not want to do anything else to make things right. Our party of 30 stood at the door waiting an unacceptable amount of time, my fiancé and I were very upset that we our reservations weren&#39;t accounted, I spent over 20 minutes trying to pull reservation up on my phone and was very upset they forgot about us . I expected better treatment after a mistake like that. Food was good, servers did a great job rushing to take care of us BUT MANAGEMENT failed to make this right.

We won&#39;t be back and I think I can speak for our wedding party that they won&#39;t be back either. I would like to add that I posted this same feedback to their FB page and rather them them reaching out to see what they could do or to apologize they took down the rating/review rating on their profile.**** I also wrote a email to corporate ACE Ala Carte Entertainment, here is the response John,We received your message re: Moretti&#39;s and apologize for the mishap.The manager Emily is no longer with us and should have called the GM for a problem like this.Please email me your address so I can send a GC that will invite you out for dinner on us and will hopefully let you know we care and use us again in the future. **** I did receive a GC from ACE but clearly they don&#39;t get it, the issue we had was for our wedding rehearsal dinner so that would imply that my wife and I both were involved, the gift card we received might cover the cost of maybe 1 person.

If you&#39;re looking for a review on the taste of the food, I&#39;d give it 4 stars. Unfortunately, this is a review on my experience as a whole.
I went to Moretti&#39;s yesterday for dinner with my mom and my yia yia. We got there around 5:45 and were given a pager and told it would be about 20-25 minutes. We did wait about 20 minutes before we were seated at a table in the back. It was the closest table to the kitchen. Normally I&#39;d ask to be seated somewhere else since my yia yia hates sitting by the kitchen, but the place was slammed. (1/2 off pizza on Tuesdays will ensure a busy restaurant). Now, you would think that being so close to the kitchen, we&#39;d be greeted right away. Not the case. By the time our server, Rachael (she didn&#39;t give us her name, but wrote it on our receipt), greeted us, we were already ready to order our drinks, appetizer, and pizzas. Our appetizer, a caprese salad, took an extraordinarily long time to come out, seeing as it didn&#39;t have to be cooked. 
While we were waiting, they sat the two tables surrounding us, and it got really tight. my mom was back to back with the man at the table behind us, which pretty much imprisoned the man next to us between the tables and the window. When he was ready to leave, the people at the other table had to get up and push in their chairs so he could get by, and he still knocked into my mom.
After our pizzas came, Rachael never came back to check on us, and I had an empty cup just waiting for a refill. We ordered sausage pizza and mac &amp; cheese pizza, both of which can make a girl thirsty! Rachael was very attentive to all her other tables around us but completely ignored us until we had to flag her down for a check. I got my refill... but someone else dropped it off while Rachael was printing our check. 
While we were waiting for Rachael to come back so we could pay, the hostess came by to try to seat the table next to us. (the same table that required people to get up and move so the man could get out) The table hadnt been cleaned yet, and it was missing a chair, and the hostess wanted a busboy to get in there right away to clean it up and get it ready. My mom was pretty fed up with being knocked around and told the hostess just to take the chair she was sitting in and she&#39;d move to another spot at our table until it was time to go. She also told her how Rachael had been scarce, and asked if she would just take our check.  The hostess was apologetic and apologized again when we were on our way out, and I appreciated that. However, she didn&#39;t apologize for the hullabaloo over seating that corner table. 
Step it up, Moretti&#39;s. You know you&#39;re going to be busy on Tuesdays, so maybe consider scheduling your &#34;A&#34; staff and moving the tables in the back so there&#39;s a little more wiggle room."

Nosh is definitely no secret, but it is slightly hidden on James Street, set back slightly farther than other store fronts.

The food and drinks are good.  I had the Monte Cristo Benedict, with a grape hollandaise sauce.  There are some solid breakfast staples on the menu as well as some inventive dishes - they&#39;ve really got the hollandaise thing down.  The eggs on my benedict were cooked perfectly, which is crucial to a good benedict!  The benedict came with a side of my choice - the potatoes were okay, just potatoes really, next time I&#39;ll try the ginger pears.  The food prices and portions are perfect.  Most entrees are in the $10-12 range.

The drinks are made well and decently sized and priced.  For $8, I had a really good raspberry pear mimosa.

The interior is a little blah and lacks some comfort at the tables in the center of the restaurant.  The service was good, but I felt a little rushed at the end of our meal, but I could have stayed for another drink to catch up with a friend.

Nosh has good food and drinks and is worth a short drive, but it is not a spot to linger."

Smallish and gratefully off the overworn Geneva shopping path, a major step above your usual independent diner variety, quality ingredients, furnishings and help. 
One of us, not me, was disappointed to find that the biscuits and gravy are only available on the weekends. My older brother had one of the best blueberry pancake plates he said he had ever had, and he knows blueberry pancakes. I went with the Chilaquiles plate because Renee said it was spicy, and it was a little spicy.  I had avocado added, but what it really needed was something to make it really a mess like tomatoes and more cheese. Picture good house made nachos in a thicker sea of chicken broth with a couple eggs over easy on top and some grated cheese, mushy, kind of a deconstructed egg nacho frittata without the shrooms, tomatoes and spinach.  Needed some texture and color, but I still liked it and appreciated the recommendation because it was different. I&#39;ll order it again in about 40 years if I don&#39;t have my teeth. You can also add other meats. I should have added the chorizo, didn&#39;t spot it until later, not my best ordering. By the way, adding all that almost doubles the price. Fairly priced for the level of quality and service.

Better than average coffee in nice LARGE mugs thank you. Not much sound absorption in there so it&#39;s LOUDer than it needs to be. Anything on the polished concrete floors and largely bare ceilings/wall coverings would help. Maybe a little dark but I prefer that over the too bright too early breakfast look. Nice booth or window options, very comfortable.

Served very ably by Renee and helpers. We&#39;ll be back."

The patio is great for a beautiful summer morning. Our server was pleasant and got me a coffee to go. The coffe is solid!

The food was the downfall of the trip. I&#39;m not sure if we ordered the &#34;wrong&#34; food, but it was not very good. I ordered the Sedona omelette with pulled pork/cheese/ham. It arrived (almost too quickly) in one of those pre made egg shells. The pulled pork lacked flavor and the omelette was soggy. The potatoes were also not very crisp. The toast was good! (That&#39;s sad)

My husband ordered eggs, bacon, and steak. Steak came in those strips like you get out of the bag. And the bacon was I Hop quality. He said the eggs were good. Once again, kinda sad.

I assumed it would be for brunch, but when Olivia B and I planned to meet for lunch in the area I thought -- hey, nows a good a time as any!

The restaurant was busy at 12:30 pm on a Friday, but we were still able to get a table right away. Our waitress was nice, checked in on us often, and asked before clearing our plates. Per usual, I had a bit of a tug of war between all the breakfast and lunch options. I mean really, how do you choose? I decided since I actually ate a decent breakfast that day, I would opt for the lunch side of the menu.

I&#39;ve been on a salad kick lately, so I went with the grilled steak salad. This leafy lunch includes grilled flat iron steak, mixed greens, tomato, red onion, and crumbled blue cheese with sweet mustard vinaigrette. Once I heard Olivia was adding avocado to her meal, I couldn&#39;t help but agree that it would be a great addition to my salad. Highly suggest doing this! The salad was tasty regardless, but the avocado paired nicely (like it usually does with most everything).

Being a Friday, we decided to indulge in a mimosa at lunch. I love that they have a fun mimosa list of flavors and other cocktails. Always nice to have options! That being said, I was feeling OJ so I stuck with a classic mimosa. And let me tell you, these bubbly cocktails aren&#39;t messing around! Forget the dainty little flute you&#39;re used to, this pint-like glass is full to the brim and not shy with the champs either!

Great atmosphere, intriguing menu, and decent prices -- I&#39;ll definitely be back to sit on their patio and dive into brunch."

Being a Friday, I quickly made two excellent decisions 1 - I indulged in breakfast at 12:30 because why not? and 2 - we both chose to enjoy mimosas with our meals! 

They have a whole menu of mimosas and I believe I had something along the lines of mango pomegranate. It was SO tasty and believe me you it was quite a large glass not a dainty little thing. I loved my choice.

My food...was alright. I didn&#39;t particularly love the tri-colored benedict I ordered. Why, you may ask? Well, despite it&#39;s name, everything on my plate was so...beige. Really. Check out the pic attached. I&#39;m not even making up the name TRI-COLORED BENEDICT. Once I did a little digging I did find two teeny shriveled up (oven roasted) tomato pieces between the english muffin and poached eggs but the dish left a lot to be desired. 

That said, I&#39;ve been here a few times before and have ordered other breakfast menu items I&#39;ve loved, including the Wisconsin Farmhouse Omelet.

I do wish they had more side options, like fresh fruit instead of just their gingered pears and hash browns (why are hash browns so undeniably delicious compared to other potato options?) instead of just their roasted potatoes."

Glad I didn&#39;t chuck my Northface on Ebay when I moved to Orange County. My hood was up the entire time my sisters insisted we stroll downtown Geneva in the nasty, misty 38 degree weather. (I&#39;m never moving back. EVER.)

After losing a battle royale with my sister-in-law about where to take the girls to lunch (I pushed Bien Trucha HEAVILY) she won the fight and we ended up at Nosh. I was meh, but also hopeful because the Yelp reviews were favorable.

Nosh is a cute space, kind-of reminded me of Eat Chow in Costa Mesa. The service was efficient. Food was solid...I ordered the lobster bisque with a side of seasoned fries. I tried my sister-in-laws&#39;s migas de pan caliente and kicked my own *** for not listening to the local order. AMAZING. 

My neice&#39;s jalepeno cream soup was yummy as well as my mom&#39;s French toast. (I should make myself a shirt that says &#34;I&#39;m Yelp Elite, which translates to I&#39;m asking for a bite of your plate&#34;)

They offer quite a few tempting variations on eggs benedict, I just knew I was booked for an early dinner and didn&#39;t want to overindulge. 

All said, Nosh is a solid little brunch spot in Geneva. If you haven&#39;t been to Bien Trucha, and you&#39;re looking for lunch/dinner, you&#39;re missing out on something very special."

I ended up with the red eye benedict and it was fantastic.  I also had a bruleed grapefruit, which was DELICIOUS but difficult to eat in a restaurant.  I ended up with juice all over me :)

I think that the sides that come with breakfast were a little lacking.  The roasted potatoes were uninspired, as were the gingered pears.  My husband got french fries with his, which were delicious.  That would definitely be my recommendation, despite the issues I have with having french fries for breakfast.

I highly recommend the poinsettia mimosa (champagne, cranberry juice and a splash of Grand Mariner.) The Salmon Benedict was out of this world - perfect blend of flavors and just the right size.

Some restaurants get annoyed with people like me who don&#39;t want breakfast during &#34;breakfast time&#34; but not Nosh! I had the chicken salad sandwich, and it was the best chicken salad sandwich I have ever had. I loved that there were non-fried side dish items for no additional charge as well. So for a great price, I received a delicious sandwich (that I actually got two meals out of because it was quite large) in a fast friendly manner and I didn&#39;t get stuck with French fries.

However, some things about this place (based on my two visits) have left me less-than-wowed. First and foremost, it&#39;s INCREDIBLY LOUD. To the point of being unpleasant. There is no music to break up the clatter either, so 30 different conversations are competing to be heard.

The second problem has been service. I will concentrate on our visit today, but things were pretty much the same on our previous visit as well, although that was a weekend breakfast and today is Monday lunch. 

There is a plethora of staff, but they all seem to be rushing around, despite the small size of the restaurant. We were seated but not given menus, given three glasses of water instead of five, all of which were less than completely filled because the guy filling them was in too much of a hurry to pour enough water. Our waitress was nice enough, but she was not the one to bring our food. The person who did bring our food just sat each plate down in any old place, despite our indication of where each belonged. They were also very slow to pick up our payment by the time we were ready to leave. None of these issues is a deal-breaker though, especially with some of their tasty food offerings...

I had small portions of the savory French toast and the Nosh French toast. Both were delicious! I have an abundant appetite, so I probably could have eaten full portions of each. Also, try the bacon. Mmm. For all of this yumminess, I will surely be back. But maybe I&#39;ll bring some ear plugs or try to sit outside, to make the experience more enjoyable for an introvert like myself."

Come here early, y&#39;all. My friend and I got here at 8:30am and had a choice of tables, but left at 10 and the parking lot was full of people standing and waiting. Yikes! But they have a HUGE parking lot and ample street parking, so that&#39;s a good thing.

Anyway, the menu is very tiny and casually printed on a tri-fold piece of paper, and the interior is teeny (but very bright and visually appealing). We both ordered coffee and I am so mad at myself for not finding out what brand they brew because it was DELICIOUS. Strong, dark, amaze. I had I think 44 cups. Approx.

The menu has so many unique and delicious sounding options, with an entire column devoted to mexican-inspired/flavors items (be still my heart). They also have lots of unique and wonderful sounding sweet items - banana foster pancakes and a french toast with a lemon creme anglaise caught my eye, but I finally settled on the crab cake benedict, and my friend got a Mexican Benedict with a jalapeño hollandaise - uhhhyum. Being completely unable to exercise self control, we also got a &#34;tasting&#34; of the chocolate french toast (for $5! So worth it! Taste the rainbow of delish pancake/french toasts for $5 each!).

I seriously LOVED the presentation of our meals. The English muffins, crab cakes, and poached eggs were so perfectly round, with the hollandaise neatly adorning them. It was a very clean looking plate. Their breakfast potatoes were simply roasted, and there were even purple potatoes in my mix. I ate every bite!

The chocolate french toast was delicious, but cloyingly heavy/sweet. A tasting would be the only way to go for me. 

Our server was bubbly, lovely, attentive, helpful, well-paced, and great. I can&#39;t wait to come back and try more dishes. SUCH a great find in quaint little Geneva!"

I wasn&#39;t actually hungry, having eaten late, so I missed out on a full meal, but I had a cup of the creamy jalapeno soup, which was DIVINE: roasted jalapenos offered a sweet kiss of background heat against the smooth glide of cream. 

My two companions also got soup, each a different one. My aunt had lobster bisque, which she said rivaled what she&#39;d gotten on a recent trip to New England; and my father had hearty Tuscan soup, laden with beans in a sturdy broth. 

They went on to have entrees as well. My aunt raved about the construction of her portobello wrap: it didn&#39;t collapse as it was consumed, and oh yeah, it was delicious (she dubbed it &#34;one of the best sandwiches I ever ate.&#34;) My dad got a grilled chicken wrap and was also satisfied with the light, crispy bread that enclosed the filling.

I&#39;ve never had a bad thing here (my favorite is still the Nosh French Toast, but now if I&#39;m feeling savory I know I can count on the jalapeno soup!!) Overall, Nosh is Number 1 in Geneva&#39;s food scene!"

Fresh squeezed OJ was the bomb diggity. Multigrain toast was a nice treat.

Main dish was a Muchacho Omelette. EXCELLENT.

Server was new, but very friendly and efficient.

Very clean and nicely decorated. Outdoor seating is a nice touch, but maybe too close to the smells of a typical alley."

The food is awesome - 5 stars for sure! They have some really different menu items, specifically the different types of bennys and french toasts. I wanted to try them all! Fun fact, you can get a sampler size of different items on the menu. My friend couldn&#39;t decide between 2, so she got a half portion of each. I wish they had that on the menu! I ended up getting the benny that was like a caprese salad. Sounds weird, but it was good! Everyone I was with enjoyed what they ordered. Their coffee and cocktails are also very good.

The service was good - we always had drinks filled and plates cleared. My only issue was, since this is such a small place there is a wait (of course). That&#39;s fine. There aren&#39;t many places to sit inside and wait, so you have to wait outside. I understand that they want to get more business and get people in and out, but we felt like we were being watched and rushed the entire time. We were asked about 5 times if we wanted boxes for our leftovers. We aren&#39;t done yet!!! Simmer down. I don&#39;t want to feel like I&#39;m being rushed out of a place. I paid to be here too ya know.

If that had not been the case, this place would probably be 5 stars."

It was lovely but this time, our waitress who did not give us her name was rude out of the gate. My boyfriend and i are vegetarian for the month of February and when we asked about the soup of the day she was visibly irritated at the fact we were asking about which soups had meat. One of the water glasses had a lip print on it and she seemed irritated at the fact that we brought it up. So we got the black bean soup which was delicious. We also shared the eyekeya pancakes which were amazing and you must try them! All and all the food was good but the service seemed very unprofessional especially when two women sat next to us and she was extreamly engaging to them. Oh and her reciept said her name was renee.

We sat down, ordered our food, started eating. Everything was great but then my daughter had to go to the bathroom and I didn&#39;t feel comfortable sending her alone. So I went with her, we were in the bathroom for maybe 3-4 minutes and when we got out our table was completely cleared with no waitress or anything in site. I was speechless. We weren&#39;t even half way through our meal. There were other open tables- they weren&#39;t that busy so I seriously didn&#39;t even know what to do. I stood at the counter where our waitress was standing and waited for her to turn around- still speechless at this point. Finally she did and I told her we weren&#39;t done eating and she just shrugged her shoulders and said oh do you want us to make you more. I walked right out of there- I&#39;ve never been treated so rudely in my life. My daughter was so disappointed and wanted to eat her pancake that was thrown away."

We were super excited to try it out, but made the mistake of going during Sunday brunch. When we were told the wait would be about an hour, we decided to go back during the week. It was much less busy and we were seated right away. 

The decor is eclectic, not my style, but very trendy. We both ordered mimosas, which were fine. It was just a little overpriced for the small size of the glass they are served it. I ordered an omelette, even though I was intrigued by another dish, but I was disappointed to find that certain menu options are only available on the weekends. I guess it makes sense as a business decision, but it&#39;s definitely off putting to customers, especially when the wait is 1+hour to even get a table on the weekends. My Wisconsin Farmhouse omelette was ok, it was on the colder side, which is always a let down, especially since we had to wait a bit for the food. 

Our server was fine, the food was fine, the environment was fine. It was not worth the price we paid. We were so excited to try, but now that we have, we probably won&#39;t be going back."

This place has tons of unique menu items, many of which sounded very appealing to me. I ended up going with the breakfast burrito. It was huge and so flavor-filed. It came with potatoes which were also cooked to perfection. My friends and I also split chocolate chip French toast. I am typically not a huge sweet breakfast fan...but I gotta say this was so delicious!

I would echo another review that I read on this place about feeling slightly rushed due to the space constraints. We were finishing up our coffee and were asked multiple times if we needed anything else. It gets to a point where you&#39;re slightly uncomfortable. I will be back to Nosh in the near future!"

We waited and waited and waited. Twenty minutes and no server looked at us or came to us. We saw servers folding napkins, stretching and looking bored by the chefs. Not once did any server look at us or talk to us. So we got up and asked to speak to the manager. We were told no manager was there.

My husband ordered the Shrimp Tacos. when the server put the plate down in front of him everyone at the table chuckled. The (3) Tacos were made with the four inch tiny tortillas which looked like something a five year old child would eat. He said the one and a half shrimp per taco was a Joke.

It&#39;s small and simple with a touch of family friendly hipster. 
It&#39;s a bit tucked away from the busy street of downtown Geneva 
but not so tucked away where you could miss it.

My boyfriend and I decided to grab a light lunch here.
It was a little too late to be considered brunch.
The place was packed with people laughing and enjoying themselves
 but we were still seated right away which was awesome! 

The waitress was a delight! 
She definitely knew the menu and had no problem giving us recommendations. 
I love service like that! Especially when it&#39;s my first time visiting. 

 My order was extremely simple. 
I like to go simple when trying a new restaurant most of the time. 
I find that if you can mess up something simple then there&#39;s little hope for the rest. 
Anyway, I went with the Basil Pesto Flatbread with a side salad and a mimosa.
The mimosa was okay, not great. I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again. 
That flatbread though...man...that was so good! 
It&#39;s not your traditional flatbread. I would say it&#39;s similar to a pizza crust. 
Not Pizza Hut pizza crust but fresh, legit made to order pizza crust.  

 My boyfriend had a crab cake trio kind of thing.
I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s actually called on the menu but it seems to be off their menu now. 
He also had their pear side. 
He wasn&#39;t to found of the crab cake trio, he said they were a bit on the dry side.

We ended up going up there and they admitted that our name &#34;got lost on the list&#34; and that they would seat us next. It&#39;s not pleasant to wait here as everyone is hovering around the door and bumping in to one another on the way in. I was also hoping for some additional gluten free options. I ordered 2 eggs, the gluten free toast and bacon. Most of their prices seemed fair, but they charged me $2.50 for the toast and I was given only one slice!

This morning, however, aside from our friendly and attentive server, our trip to Nosh was a massive disappointment.

Kristina U&#39;s review is dead on: &#34;Pretentious patrons and over-priced drinks.&#34; And not just the boozy kind. And the crowd... Oh the crowd. We felt very rushed by the bus staff, plus the acoustics of the place simply made everything worse. If you don&#39;t deal well with crowds and noise - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Nosh feels like it belongs in Wicker Park or Logan Square, not Geneva just West of the Fox River. All it needs is slightly more difficult parking, and they&#39;ll have nailed the whole thing perfectly.


Also, Celiacs and those with gluten issues beware. Your menu options are seriously restricted. I had the Costa Rican Breakfast - &#34;Two eggs with cheesy vegetarian pink beans served along side jicama slaw, chipotle vinaigrette and a house-made cheesy tortilla.&#34; Sounds delightful. But there simply wasn&#39;t enough of it. Not filling Not at all. And while the house-made tortillas looked beautiful, they were the most bland and tasteless thing I&#39;ve eaten in ages. The jicama slaw was the best thing I had today, but again - there simply wasn&#39;t enough of it. And the &#34;cheesy vegetarian pink beans&#34; looked, smelled, and tasted like basic re-fried beans. And again, there were barely any on my plate.

I shouldn&#39;t be leaving brunch with both an empty wallet and an empty stomach.

I left Nosh today feeling as though I had been conned."

Multiple types of Eggs Benedict on the menu, among other great selections.

The benedicts and the chocolate French toast are especially great. Working my way through the menu!

I&#39;m stunned that other Yelpers think this is overpriced; it&#39;s quality food and it&#39;s fairly priced in my opinion, especially compared to other independent places in the area. Fresh ingredients and well made dishes that aren&#39;t overly processed will, in fact, cost a little bit more. 

Agree that the water pouring folks seem to hover like attack hounds, though. Nice to be prompt but these folks are a bit too attentive."

A year later, I went back as a vegan, after another vegan recommended their menu as having a lot of options. They have some options that can be modified - the Greek wrap, the veggie panini, the NLT, etc. but the server we had yesterday was all, &#34;Vegan? What&#39;s that?&#34; And told us we must be their &#34;first vegans.&#34; I get it. She didn&#39;t know much about it. That&#39;s okay. But this is a foodie establishment - and I know they had options... So we figured it out. Ordered everything with no cheese, no cream sauces, no meat, dairy, etc. and yet there was dairy on almost everything we were delivered. We try not to be difficult about our elective diet - it&#39;s not a food allergy or anything, but seriously. At a place where breakfast entrees are $15 each, I kind of expect you to give a little bit of a damn. That being said, the food is still amazing and if you&#39;re not vegan, get the French toast or salmon Benedict. Both are epically delicious."

The &#34; oven roasted potatoes were reheated tasteless and they only cut them in large halves.  My husband ordered a Mexican egg dish that was a horrific pile of eggs shaped like it came out of a tuna can served in a bowl. The eggs were dry, bacon uncooked.

The French market, btw, was not impressive.  The produce and other items are overpriced with hardly any French influence. They were selling polish sausage and tamales of all things.  Where were the crepes, foie gras and croissants?  Anyway....

After walking around town for a while we decided to dine at Nosh based on the rave reviews and the number of people dining at the establishment.  The restaurant itself is cute.  The outdoor patio faces a parking lot.  As for the food, it was just okay.   I had the French Country Baguette.  It was pretty good, but nothing to brag about.  The seasoned fries were tasty.  My mom had the chicken salad pita.  It was just so-so in flavor.  There was hardly any chicken salad in the pita.  She was also expecting for the pita to be warm, which it was not.  Her herbed potatoes were lacking in herbs and seasoning. Overall, the food is about average in taste while the service is friendly and courteous.  I&#39;m pretty sure I won&#39;t be returning."

I had Violet&#39;s Pancakes and they were good.  About half way through it started to taste overly sweet.  I couldn&#39;t finish it.  I did like the option to half your order.  2 pancakes (the size of a dinner plate) are more than enough for me.  I also ordered a side of apple smoked bacon and it was DELICIOUS.  I&#39;d go back for the bacon alone.
My husband ordered the whole wheat french toast and he really liked it.  I would say that the food didn&#39;t blow our minds nor did we leave saying we LOVED it but overall it was good.

The only thing that was annoying was the water guy. We weren&#39;t even seated  yet, we were trying to get our 1 year old situated in her high chair while de-winterizing her (removing her bulky winter coat, hat, mittens, etc) and the water guy was reaching over us, through us, every which way he could, trying to fill our waters. Can&#39;t you just wait till we&#39;re situated and actually seated before filling our waters?  I don&#39;t understand why such a rush.  They weren&#39;t even busy.  

Overall, we were out for under $20, had a yummy breakfast and we liked that it had a small hometown feel; we&#39;ll be back."

As on past visits, when the room is full, it is very loud.  But you&#39;ll forget all about the noise when you taste the wonderful food.

Having already had the Egg&#39;r (yum), the Lorraine Omelet (Yum) and the Savory French Toast (YUM!), I decided to finally try the Jalapeno Benedict which has been calling to my taste buds since I first saw it on the menu.  I always avoided it on previous visits because I thought it would be too heavy, particularly on a work day, but was I ever wrong!  The skirt steak is done to perfection and the jalapeno hollandaise is light and fresh with just the perfect amount of heat at the back of your throat to make this a winner anyway you look at it.

My wife is not typically an eggs Benedict fan because of the richness, but she tried the salmon version and was pleased beyond compare.  Again, the hollandaise was light and fresh and the dill in the sauce was a great complement to the delicious cured  salmon. 

We both felt satisfied without being overly filled.  We love Nosh!"

I would not suggest getting the &#34;ginger honey pears&#34;. I was expecting something else, but really it just seemed like unripe slices of pears. Maybe they would be better in season, but I just did not enjoy them at all. I couldn&#39;t taste the ginger, nor the honey and I have very enhanced taste buds (or so I think).

This first visit was very disappointing to say the least. I ordered the crab cake benedict, and the crab cake was overseasoned and overfried, which overtook all the delicate flavors of the crab. Worse was the egg that came with the benedict, which was not poached but soft boiled (seriously? don&#39;t they teach you that in Cooking 101?). Mine wasn&#39;t the only problem poached egg either, 2 others received the same. I also tried out the french toast, and those were just standard albeit weirdly cut in strips like steak fries, but the taste nothing special. But then I started tasting the sauce that was on the french toast against the sauce on the crab benedict, and it ended up being the exact same bland sauce, some mystery yellow sauce that didn&#39;t seem to be hollandaise or creme anglais. I like mysteries, but what the?!?! Even the side of bacon was served cold, I could have eaten precooked microwave bacon that was crispier.
I did enjoy the fresh squeezed orange juice, the side of honey pears that came with the benedict, but come on now. When the people taking me out start saying stuff like, &#34;maybe the chef is having an off day...&#34; or, &#34;it really isn&#39;t like this usually...&#34;, that means many other people in the group are having the exact same thought, which was &#34;I wish we could rewind and go somewhere that&#39;s actually good.&#34;
Seriously, the only 2 great things about my meal was our fantastic waitress and the cool light fixture in the dining room (the great service was the only reason why I&#39;m giving this place 2 stars). Otherwise, if this meal is any indication of the average meal here, Nosh really needs to pull it together."

I figured I might as well treat my wife to somewhere new for my birthday since I still haven&#39;t found a restaurant that serves a consistently good french toast.

I expected a wait from the articles I have read but even though the restaurant was small we were quickly seated. It did seem to take a bit long for our server to acknowledge us and ask us for a beverage even though it did not seem particularly busy . My wife had trouble ordering but even though I had mentioned it was our first time here our server seemed patient but not helpful.

My wife and I both order the Nosh French Toast which is described as 
&#34;Our special recipe of challah bread soaked in vanilla-orange zest infused batter, served with lemon creme anglaise and powdered sugar&#34;

The french toast is said to be three pieces of bread but it was hard to tell since it is served slice into strips.  The french toast itself was a bit dry and although the batter and sauce seemed excellent the bread itself was thin and dry. Hardly &#34;soaked&#34;.  Looking at the toast as I worked my way down it seems that my wife and I were both served end pieces of the loaf so this may have accounted for the toughness of the meal.

The side of bacon was perfectly cooked and the herb potatoes my wife order were beautifully cooked but seasoning on the potatoes was barely noticeable. 

Overall average service, disinterested staff, unremarkable french toast adds up to our money being spent closer to home. Not worth the trip."

My wedding food was catered by Jamison&#39;s.  I&#39;m always very honest with reviews so I have several pros and cons to share. 
Cons; we ordered the chicken marsala and it was different from the chicken we received in our tasting. The chicken we got in our tasting was  not breaded and was lightly salted. But the chicken they served to all of our guests turned out to be breaded and too salty for most of our guests. A lot of guests did not finish their meals. The green beans and mashed potatoes were good most people eat those. 
- there are two managers at Jamison&#39;s and one other manager who I think is part time. Most of the time it took a week or two for my questions to be answered. When it comes to wedding planning waiting a week or two means your other vendors have to wait a week or two as well. That&#39;s not OK. The restaurant is always very busy and I understand that they have to spend most of their time running the restaurant. It would be helpful if they had a separate manager who only took care of banquets and weddings. Waiting over two weeks to get the dimensions of tables just so I can place my tablecloth rentals is unacceptable. 
- A wedding cake and sweets table is included in the wedding package, however fondant frosting is not included in your wedding cake. I was not informed of this and almost had to redesign my entire cake 9 days before my wedding. There is no information on the actual wedding package menu about certain types of frosting not being included. When I called to try to resolve the issue Jamison&#39;s staff basically blamed it on me. I thought that was really unprofessional. They ended up paying for the fondant but not until after the staff member made sure to tell me that it was all my fault. 
PROs; The ballroom (which is part of Del Webb) was very spacious and modern. The gallery where we held our cocktail hour was also spacious and had a great view of the golf course. 
- on the day of the wedding Jamison staff did a great job getting everything running on time. We did not have to wait too long  for the next course to be served. 
- Jamison&#39;s has a wedding package menu and also a banquet menu that is less expensive. So it&#39;s actually a great option for all budgets. 
-The cake included in the wedding package menu is ordered from sugar Hill&#39;s bakery. If you&#39;re from this area and you know that Sugar Hills is the best bakery around. So that&#39;s a plus. 
Overall I was pretty disappointed with the quality of the food, and  I would&#39;ve ordered a different meal for everyone had I know it was going to taste and look completely different from what I received during my tasting. I did not even eat my meal. 
I wasn&#39;t happy with the response time or the attitude of some of the staff. To be honest I kind of felt uncomfortable some of the time. There is a lot going on during your wedding day so I didn&#39;t have to deal with that too much. When you&#39;re a banquet manager taking your sweet time in replying and overall poor communication is unacceptable. Especially when you blame your shortcomings on your clients. Everything leading up to the big day was pretty stressful with these guys."

First, the location is great. The parking lot is large and always has spots available. The building is up to date and clean. The view over the golf course is great on both sunny and rainy days. We haven&#39;t tried eating outside, yet, but it promises to be good as well. Five stars, here.

The service is decent, but not stellar. If you remember that this restaurant is located within a retirement community, the exceedingly slow service is at least somewhat acceptable. Still on the slow side, but polite and mostly (though not always) remember what you asked for. Four stars, but a lower rating here if they weren&#39;t most often serving retired seniors who seem to have no urgency - my family included. ;-)

The food is decent, though a mostly average diner-like menu. The steaks are not their strong suit, even thought it&#39;s called a &#39;Charhouse&#39;! Their salads are very basic, but taste fresh. Soups are OK, though some are a bit salty for my taste. Vegetables and some rice tend to be overcooked, but &#39;functional. Some of their fish and chicken dinners are decent, though I did one time have fish which tasted &#39;fishy&#39;. They did replace this dish, but in general things are not worth the prices charged. Most often, the ingredients seem to be fresh (fishy meal excepted), though the preparation is very standard. Three stars, and just barely at that because of the complacency of the cooks to not be more creative or create more appetizing meals.

I average these three points to come up with a decent four-star rating. If you are looking for the food, go elsewhere. If you want a nice, convenient place to spend time with someone living in the area, the food is decent enough that it can be offset by a convenient and beautiful location."

Hard to pass on the very moist carrot cake which was shared by three or four at the table. Even DH who insisted he did not want dessert took several forkfuls!

I chose a house salad to start - very fresh and tasty with a balsamic dressing.  I had a perfectly prepared ribeye medium rare just to the point that collagen starts to melt. I was also pleased that the size was reasonable (12oz) when everyone else is touting huge oversized cuts. Add to that reasonable prices and it becomes terrific.  I completed my meal with a very good baked potato and an individual key lime pie. My friend had a sirloin with steamed veggies and finished with a piece of flourless chocolate cake - half of which he took home to his wife to be popular on the home front.

I skipped the starters and went right for the Porter house. 20 oz. With very little fat or grizzle. The wife and our friend had the filet mignon. Cooked perfectly. The wife and I had baked potatoes and our friend had the garlic mashed potatoes. Both very good. The mixed veges were not mushy and had just the right bite. We started with the dinner salad which were greens instead of the standard Ice Berg lettuce. I&#39;ve eaten here 3 or 4 times. The food whether fish or meat has always been constantly good. I&#39;ve also had the Sunday brunch which is okay. Reasonable prices and good service make this place a winner!"

This is the most disgusting food I have had in a LONG time.  A couple months ago when I went I got a chicken breast dinner that arrived in this absolutely vile cream sauce that tasted and smelled like it came straight out of a pouch.  It also had mushrooms, which I&#39;m pretty sure were out of a can (there&#39;s no excuse for that, EVER). 

This past Sunday I was forced to go back and chose to get the buffet/brunch, figuring there had to be something edible.  Let me say, the oatmeal cookie I had was fantastic.  However, the macaroni &amp; cheese (another worst ever - the color should have tipped me off), and eggs Benedict were seriously so repulsive I couldn&#39;t force myself to eat them.  I went back for a waffle which at least didn&#39;t make me want to vomit, but wasn&#39;t great.  I decided to get a salad, (because how can you mess up lettuce)...and the salad dressing was awful.   I then gave up.  I left a buffet HUNGRY. How does that happen? 

I do have to say our server both times was friendly and accommodating.  I wish she could get a job somewhere else.  The worst part about this disgusting place is I will inevitably be dragged back here, because it&#39;s the closest place to where my grandma lives.  AVOID IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE."

On the other hand the service has been so slow I may be moving into the Del Web retirement village by the time they serve me my food. So lets get the bad out of the way first. Crazy long wait to get our food after ordering, I have dined her twice and both times same thing has happened. Almost 2 1/2 hours to get in and out is way to long for a suppose to be quick casual dinner. People who arrived after us where leaving before us and others you could see had same problem we did, long wait. Bus boys are non existent have to beg for bread and water then wait and wait and ask again. Really it just get irritating trying to track your waiter or bus boy down for something. You have to ask for everything it is never just done for you,  have to ask for more water, more bread, want another drink ect ect. I think it&#39;s a little unprofessionally run and they could stand to have someone in and train the service staff how things should work. Makes it hard to want to go back, but in-laws live out there so sure we will give it another try. Next time though I will preempt the slow service with directions what we need and problem before we order and see if that helps. 

The good part!!! We live in city so seeing the prices for drinks and food makes my wallet smile. Glasses of wine for 6 bucks bloody marys on Sunday for 5 bucks the list goes on can&#39;t argue with that. Food same deal with prices I had a  NY strip steak for 21 bucks includes salad or soup plus potato  and veggie. Everything is priced that way and portion sizes won&#39;t leave you hungry. ( Thats unless service is so slow they keep you so long you should of eaten 2 meals, I couldn&#39;t resist.) The food is also really good both times I have had NY strip although it was over cook a bit for medium rare but still a little pink and great steak quality with a nice char crust. Wife liked her filets also a little over cooked, so my advice is order undercooked to your liking. Sides where pretty good kinda like banquet food but ok. Everyone else has always liked their food and its a nice atmosphere with view of grounds  but no one liked waiting or having to ask for everything.  If they can solve that problem this place would be tops on my list."

When you call yourself a &#34;Charhouse&#34; the steak, especially a Porterhouse should have a char on it. It was medium-well at best. Long story slightly less long, our waitress never showed up to see how our meals were, and we didn&#39;t see her again til it was time to pay the bill.

One poor young girl trying to yell above the noise, most people could not hear her. People with reservations  were leaving, 8 reservations were called that no one was there for. No real way to check in unless you barged through the wall to wall people. We waited till 1:45 to get seated. Manager was in a bad mood and was a jerk. Server brought drinks and had to hunt for her after 30 minutes to get another cup of coffee (never could get a third). Beef was just OK, turkey was very dry, like cotton in my mouth, bacon undercooked. veggies were good, salad sparse. Chicken was just OK. Desserts were pretty good. So, for Easter brunch, way overbooked, poor service, over priced with food they would probably not normally serve. Manager really blew this today. I would not recommend and will not return."

The three young girls working the hostess stand did a great job. And I believe the front manager was Peter and he was very nice and tried to keep things moving. The wait was long and people were getting aggravated. Some left. We had a 2 pm reservation. I found it odd that they had 1:30 reservations and other ones at odd times. I mentioned to Peter that most brunches I called for offered seating at 10, 12, 2, 4 and 6. I believe they do that to keep the flow of people moving. Anyway we finally get seated or should I say taken to the ballroom where the larger seatings were being placed. We had 16. We get in there and Peter starts putting the tables together for us and another manager named Johnny (I think that was his name)says no we can&#39;t do that. Really?? we have 16 now we have to split and sit at different tables. What is the sense of making a reservation to all sit together if we can&#39;t?  So we spent our Easter meal at separate tables. Not happy to say the least. I saw other tables together and he said those were for 14. We can&#39;t do it for 16. Really. ??  Our waitress Cassandra was great though. Must give her a shout out!

The service staff is friendly but not well trained in fine dining table service. I would expect table service to be on a higher caliper at this type of restaurant.

Jamesons is located in the main lodge of Del Webb Sun City adult living community and open to the public. It has a great view of the neighborhood golf course, sports bar, and a large dining room suitable for couples to large parties. The menu is very diverse from chicken to fish and pasta to burgers.. But most everyone comes here for the steaks.. The biggest steak on the menu is under $20.00.. CANT BEAT THAT, and just about every menu item comes with soup or salad.. Their artichoke dip is very good and the blue cheese burger is one of the best in the area..

We decided to give Jameson&#39;s a try. Between the seven of us, we have tried two of their other locations and have been pleased. We were hopeful that this location would be just as good. 

Overall, it was a nice meal. You can tell that they are still trying to work out the kinks, but it wasn&#39;t bad by any stretch of the imagination. Sam (probably Samantha) was our server. She&#39;s was a sweetheart and I give her real kudos for keeping up with our nutty bunch. I think this is one of Sam&#39;s first jobs, but she did well. :-) 

We all had soup (which came with the reasonably priced meal). It was awesome! Chicken tortellini soup and cream of broccoli. The bowls were practically licked clean. Soup and warm breadsticks were an ideal start to our lunch. 

We had potato skins and calamari as an appetizer. This is my one real complaint about the meal. Both were overcooked. The potato skins were visibly burnt. And the calamari was fried waaaay too long. Needless to say, our hungry group ate both anyhow. 

I had a fried shrimp dinner with mashed potatoes. The shrimp were fried just right. The mashed potatoes were homemade with the skins on and delish! My sister had London Broil with mashed potatoes. Normally, I avoid London Broil because it is a chewy, cheap cut of meat. Not in this instance. For less than $10, she had a tender cut of beef with great flavor. My hubby went with a burger covered in BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and onion strings with french fries. He enjoyed his burger and said that he would go back. Mom &amp; Grandma shared a burger and fries (Grandma is a light eater these days). Both were happy with the meal and said that they would go back. My step-dad had pork chops. They were thick and juicy - like they should be. No complaints there. Finally, my soon-to-be-brother-in-law (I need to find a shorter title for him...), had a Parmesan crusted chopped steak. He was quiet through the meal which means it must have been good. 

Glasses were kept full (even on a hot summer day when we were very thirsty)! Empty dishes were picked up promptly. I hope we can find a reason to head out to lunch again soon!"

Our entire bill was $54 for everything, which wasn&#39;t bad for four adults and one kids meal, but everything took SO long to get.  Even after we ordered, we waited for.ev.er for the soup to come out, and then the entrees.

We had to flag down the waitress for the check after waiting for it for about 20 minutes.  So basically we arrived at 12:30 and we didn&#39;t leave there until after 2:30.  It was rough with two young kids.

I probably wouldn&#39;t go back.  It wasn&#39;t worth the frustration."

The service is incredible.  The food is fabulous and nothing on the menu is over $20, except a few specials that may go as high as $25.   The soups are homemade, the Calamari is superb and the Potato Skins are HUGE!   My mother had a Blue Cheese Burger and said that it was one of the best burgers that she has ever had.   I had the Filet and Shrimp.   It was cooked to a perfect med-rare and the shrimp was marinated in a delicious house marinade.  
Everyone was more than happy about thier choices.   

This is a perfect place for a family gathering or a birthday.  We hosted our daughers Graduation dinner here.  
It is VERY family friendly, so it is definitley a top on my list of kid friendly places!  
If your looking for a place to take the family or just a place to get a great steak at a fabulous price or even a nice night out with your partner, this is def the place to try and it wont break the bank!   
After writing this review, I think I am going to try to talk my husband into taking me out to dinner tonite!!"

I had figured that being in Del Webb, we could easily get a table here. I was right. Its a nice looking facility with a great fireplace. Having eaten at the Crystal Lake Jamesons we had a good idea of what to expect. We both ordered the prime rib special. It was great. We ordered them med rare, and that was exactly how they were served. We used to regular the Village Squire, having their prime rib special often and it was never quite right. The soups were good. Carrot cake for dessert was great, too. Service was good. The only complaint is the layout is pretty much just an open room of tables. Feels a tad cafeteria on layout. Putting in some booths would really give it some more restaurant feel. Maybe booths aren&#39;t preferred by the Del Webb crowd. Still a solid meal with a positive experience."

I have been to Jamesons (this one and other ones) and never had a problem. This occasion was different. First soup had things in it that shouldn&#39;t have been there. No apology from server. No bread was served despite numerous promises. They asked if I wanted some, I said yes, then at least 1/2 a dozen times I get sorry not ready yet. It was almost insulting. I was recommended a special fish, grouper I think and it was dry and almost stale. The side dishes they recommended, the came back and gave me something else saying they where out of what they recommended. The server-bartender consistently used the manager for an excuse for why nothing about this meal was right.

Heard great things about the food. Our reservations were running about 30 minutes late. Waitress was slow to greet our table, slow to bring drinks, bread. Slow to take our order. We were seated for one hour before eating. My burger and fries were cold and arrived med/ rare vs well done. Manager brought a new burger fast that was obviously hot but still med/ rare. Manager was appraised that it was still pink. They did offer a different entrée but I declined it was getting pretty late to be ordering a 3rd entree. When asked  if something could be done about the burger on the bill I was told that since I ate part (the edges)of it they wouldn&#39;t adjust the bill. When I asked to speak to the manager he was too busy to come to our table. Then someone somewhere decided that &#34;since it was Mother&#39;s day they would take it off the bill but it isnt our policy&#34;. Our waitress was very defensive about pointing it out that it was ordered correctly on her part. There is more but this is the main complaint. The others in our party of 4 enjoyed their entrees but based on John the managers less than gracious attitude we will not be back. Their loss.

Since this place is located right on the grounds of a retirement community, it is better quality than you would expect.

The restaurant is very pretty, the view is great.  We came for dinner at 4 PM.  We were told that the last seating was 4:30 for &#34;brunch&#34;.  I have to say I was really disappointed in the buffet.  When I first went up to get food, there were many stations that were empty or almost empty.  It was not appetizing.  I was able to get a few things, but went to my seat feeling annoyed at paying for a full buffet that was over half empty.  I know others also felt the same.  My feeling is that if you are seating people at 4:30, the entire table should be as full as when you seating those at noon, or 2 PM.  They finally started filling some of the containers, but I felt unsure about eating the salad or dressings or fruit.  That looked liked it was left out since morning.  I will say that the desserts were good, the salmon they finally brought out was good, and so were the mashed potatoes ( even though they were not really hot).  My advice....if you are serving a buffet for $19.95...you better be sure it is full, looks and is fresh, and keep it filled!!  I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go back for this, but I may try a regular dinner some day."

My hubby collected the monopoly game stickers and wanted to redeem them for free items.  This review isn&#39;t going to be a typical one; it will be a checklist style, so here we go:

1) Was the order-taking process painless?  Yes, the manager who took our order allowed us to use multiple stickers in one transaction and was courteous.
2) Was the order arrived in a timely manner?  Yes, it was given to us fairly quickly.  We orders two (2) orders of medium fries, two (2) orders of Oreo McFlurry, and one (1) order of cheeseburger.  
3) Did we find any bug or foreign object in our food?  No, unless they existed but couldn&#39;t see them because they were than 0.2 microns.
4) Was the location clean?  Sure, it was located with the gas station and some local folks hang out here.  The crowd looked legit, not shady.
5) Will we recommend this location to friends and family?  We assume we will, but I&#39;m not fond of McDonald&#39;s and never had any crave for this type of food, unless this was the last thing we can find on the earth.

I ordered through the drive thru. Someone started to take my order, got it wrong and then disappeared. Two people in the opposite line ordered and then my window went live again. I again gave my order, which was incorrectly repeated to me after I said &#34;hello?!&#34; Three times (there was silence for a long time after giving me order). Once I made it to the second window the window girl just repeated my sandwich so I said &#34;no&#34; and gave the entire order to which she replied &#34;well yea, that&#39;s what I got&#34;. :-|
Once I pulled up to window #2 I got my food, but no drink and had to knock on the window to get that. 
And how was the food you ask??? The fries were luke warm at best and had an old getting-stale taste. My burger, ordered with No onions SURPRISE!! Had onions galore. 

Jesus... I know this is &#34;just McDonalds&#34; but not a single person shined in this experience. 

Blah."

Initially concerned about out attire, which was extremely casual at best. those concerns quickly vanished when we entered and saw an extremely diverse attire of formal to beach to business and to barn--we felt comfortable!   

We were early for our reservations, so grabbed seats at the bar. The jazz band was amazing, and amazingly LOUD!!

Our bartender was knowledgable-made us a  mule, brandy manhattan and the house margarita. Before we got the opportunity to taste, the hostess directed us to our table. Once seated, found all drinks to be made just right....hubby is a manhattan snob, myself very picky about my mules and the kid fussy about the tequila used in any of his tequila drinks.    

The band was still overbearingly LOUD even in the dining area. Thankfully, their sound, although extremely LOUD was great-guessing the intense volume is a managerial/sound system issue--not a problem of the band.  

Our waiter, Landon, was a stitch--we needed that humor to end our day.  

The bread basket was served with a plate of roasted garlic, shredded cheese and balsamic vinegar-delightful change to simply bread and butter.  

Service was a touch on the slow side, but we had much to discuss-so as long as the drinks were full we barely noticed the time. Besides, I absolutely HATE service personell that rush you into ordering.  

Landon kept an eye on us, making sure we had what we needed without stalking or being pushy. We started with bacon blue cheese chips and some oysters. Disappointingly they were out of oysters and the chips didn&#39;t make it to the table before our main course but we didn&#39;t care as the chips were right up my alley of crunchy, gooey, blue cheese, béchamel and bacon goodness.  Even my husband and son, who generally steer clear of blue cheese (leaving more for me) found them to be quite appetizing. Thankfully it was a very generous serving-more than the three of us could eat-no worries, they&#39;re great reheated on the pizza stone at home.

We all asked many questions of our server, Landon, regarding the main courses, as we weren&#39;t sure which to order-lots of very appealing/sounding choices on the menu. We all split a gut when the music suddenly stopped to hear Landon screaming ordering ideas to us!  He was embarrassed but had a cute comeback to defuse the situation

Hubby had the penne w/grilled chicken, steamed broccoli and another manhattan. I was torn between the rib eye, kalamata pork tenderloin and moussaka. Landon said they were all great choices, asked me a few questions about my personal tastes--I decided on the moussaka and another mule. Our son had rib eye, side of roasted sweet tato, glazed baby carrots and another margarita.  

As we waited for meals to arrive, Landon was both attentive and entertaining. Hubby and he had a lot of laughs together, joking back and forth-keeping the kid and I almost in tears laughing with his comebacks and entertaining quips.

Dinner arrived and upon seeing my son&#39;s rib eye, commented on how it was kinda on the thin side.BUT once he cut into it, using the table knife, it was obviously super tender and cooked perfectly to his liking. It may not of had the superb flavor of a Mastro&#39;s-NOT saying it was flavorless-just needed a little steak sauce. Then again, this is a mediterranean dig, not a steakhouse! The roasted sweet tato and carrots were like dessert, although the kid thought both could have used more butter.

1/2 way through the meal, a manager stopped at our table, embarrassingly apologizing and handing our son a steak knife-which we had NOT asked for-as the steak was tender enough NOT to need it. Perhaps some sort of rules or policy that hadn&#39;t been adhered to?? We chuckled once the manager left at the silliness of his well intended handing off of the knife. Soon after Landon stopped by to check on us and my son handed the steak knife back. Landon looked perplexed at this gesture, and I started rolling on the floor when my son explained--just as the manager coincidently walked by again and wrenched his neck hearing the &#34;I don&#39;t need it&#34; comment.    

Hubby&#39;s penne and chicken had wonderful flavor-the penne was cooked perfectly. Sauce wasn&#39;t overbearing and very tasteful.

I thought my mouth was in heaven with the richness and full deep flavors of my moussaka.  Seriously good, comfort mediterranean dish-with ground beef not the traditional lamb which was fine with me!!  

We were all very satisfied with our choices and the service.The LOUD music could have used a few notches less of volume

Had flourless chocolate cake for dessert. Rich yummy goodness that could have used a lot more of the raspberry &#34;sauce&#34; for my personal liking.

Will eat at City Gate Grille again-Gr8 ambience;hoping all service is as good as Landon&#39;s and praying management has decided to turn down the volume of the music-bring ear plugs just in case!"

I&#39;ve been wanting to check this place out for a long time and for one reason or another didn&#39;t get there. As other reviewers say, it&#39;s definitely a hidden gem and worth finding. 

They have a really wine and craft beer selection, although the wines by the glass is a little on the high side, beers are priced just right. They also offer some great cocktails too.

As you walk in the door, you; re greeted very warmly, they offer to take your coat, everyone is professional and friendly. The place itself feels like a high quality restaurant you&#39;d find in the city. I love the huge &#34;cityscape&#34; of Chicago over the bar, beautiful.

We each out off of the prix fixed menu, she had the salmon and I had the short ribs and they were fantastic as others have said. They offered me a steak knife to cut it with, but it was so tender it wasn&#39;t needed. The salmon was also delicious, had a really nice glaze and was cooked just right. 

They also were very accommodating of my date as she is lactose intolerant and the desserts that were offered with the prix fixed meal had dairy in them so the waiter brought a serving of fresh berries instead.

The place is certainly a $$$ but well worth it, we will be going again!"

Great food, great price, great ambiance. Jazz night is fabulous. Wait staff is a little wanting though. It always takes a while before our orders are taken or our waters filled- even though the place isn&#39;t crowded. 
The bathrooms are also tricky to go to- it&#39;s down a steep flight of stairs so if you are a little older or have issues with steep narrow stairs, it will be a huge problem. The last waiter we had we thought was a little too informal and way too chatty and he tried to talk us out of ordering some of our favorites because he said it doesn&#39;t taste good and started gossiping about their current kitchen chaos and a lot about his personal life situation. Other than that very &#34;Cheap diner attitude&#34; that doesn&#39;t match the ambiance, the place is wonderful."

We started in the bar for cocktails, which was nice.  We were promptly seated at our reservation time.  Despite there being quite a few open tables, we were seated immediately next to an ordering station--one of those little kiosks that servers use to enter dinners.  Maybe I&#39;m sensitive, but there was a large LCD screen lit about 4 feet in front of me and slightly to the right.  It was distracting and not a very nice place to sit.  So, right away, I politely asked to get a different table and the hostess took care of it and got us a new table.  Great service.

Our server during dinner was great.  He did a good job of paying attention to our dinner and pace.  We were there for a nice date and great conversation, and I thought he did a great job of keeping the timing of the service great.  He slowed things down and didn&#39;t rush them, which was exactly what we wanted.  I feel like servers who are &#34;in tune&#34; with the diners are hard to find; so this was a very pleasant experience.

My biggest problem is that the food was just alright.  We both ordered medium rare hanger steak.  I had a side of sautéed mushrooms and Brussel sprout/bacon.  Wow was it salty.  Generally speaking, we both like salt and add it regularly to our food at home.  Here, however, we both thought that our dishes had an overpowering amount of salt (not just the steak but also the sides next to the steak).  Salt is one of those things where you can tolerate a bite or two of something that is salty, but each bite adds up.  At some point, you&#39;ve had enough salty bites that you&#39;re not sure you want to take another.    

So, the ambiance was good.  The service was great.  The entrees were hard for us to eat.  Ugh."

Extremely dissapointed after having dinner last Saturday at 7:00pm with a party of four.

1st Attempted to resolve during dinner &amp; spoke with the GM Jonathan Cook

2nd attempt was made &amp; I called the restaurant &amp; again spoke w/ Jonathan Cook. He remembered our table &amp; before I could provide any specifics, I was put on hold for 2 mins &amp; he returned and offered to send a token gift certificate.  I declined his offer and thanked him yet responded I&#39;m surprised you would not want to know specifically &#34;why&#34; we were unhappy.  He had no interest in finding out and I ended the call...

Why I would not recommend City Gate Grill for the service or the food

Party of 4 seated with a reservation in a section with one server and no back up servers.  Our Server already had a large party of 20-25.  Service through the entire meal was poor.  We were greeted by the server after sitting at the table for 10 minutes.  He was polite &amp; knowledgeable yet clearly overwhelmed.  

After our appetizers were served &amp; eaten, our plates, and drinks sat empty for over 10 minutes, I excused myself &amp; found the GM and explained our dissatisfaction with &#34;no&#34; service.  He came to the table, cleared it &amp; explained we were in good hands with his senior server.  He never returned to the table for the entire evening.

I reminded the server 2x to bring my dirty martini w/ blue cheese stuffed olives &amp; finally received it with pimento stuffed olives.  Waters were left emtpty through out the meal.

Food:
Appetizers - Bacon wrapped dates &amp; shrimp were ok yet I would not recommend it. There were 2 small shrimp &amp; 2 dates (4 total) that were wrapped in bacon.


Dinners:
Gnocchi - The gnocchi was not homemade &amp; reminded of the processed pasta that you see on the shelf.  The dish was oversauced so the flavors were not detectable
Rib eye steak - The steak was delicious but 30/40% was not eaten b/c it was all fat and grisle.  
Hanger steak - Excellent
Braised short ribs - Excellent
Desserts - best part of the meal / Choclolate ganache &amp; cheesecake

Sides: I ordered 2 sides, the creamed spinach &amp; Brussels sprouts but the server forgot to bring them

When we were presented with the check, nothing was comped even though the service was horrible &amp; only 50% of the meal was acceptable...  I gave the server our credit card &amp; said I was glad that we were not charged for the sides that I never received, he returned with the check &amp; advised he took off the corkage fee on two bottles of wine we brought into the restaurant.  We thanked him and ended our evening..."

My bridesmaid said the best food they had at a wedding. The selection was very good, and are customisable to an extent. The bar cocktails are better than most places,  little more alcohol ;)

The space decoration and the whole space was wonderful. I personally dont recommend anything other than chair covers and center pieces. 

The patio is a great place for a wedding away for the music and for the smokers.

Overall the place is great for events. 

Only recommendation is to repeat everything you request multiple times just in case :)"

Went with 3 girlfriends after the wine festival got canceled because of the rain.   The hostess told us the wait would be 15 minutes.   After waiting at the bar for over 45 minutes we were told it would be another 5-10 minutes.  A table at the bar opened up so we decided to sit there. We waited there for 10 minutes with no one coming by.   We left and will never go back.   Terrible service.

My friend suggested the place. She had been here a few times and said that she had loved it. The place is nice. Nothing special about the decor but clean and classy. It was infested by baby boomers but I can live with that. After all it is naperville. 

My friend said that we didnt need reservations so we never called. She was right. We got there at 815 and got seated right away. We had a great view of the band, which by the way were great. They brought the place alive. (I am a sucker for a live band though so I may be a bit bias).

As far as drinks go, we had a bottle of chanti (dont know the name but it was the only chanti offered). Good wine! They had a ton of drinks on the menu but it was a wine kind of night. For food both of my friends had steak and risotto and I had scallops and risotto. My scallops were great and so was the risotto. The steak was great as well but the risotto that came along with it did not compare to the pine nut and leek risotto that was offered with my dish. The food was great overall but a bit overpriced I thought. Sure it was delicious but it wasn&#39;t very well presented either. I had 3 scallops,  which accounts for 10 dollar a scallop so it better be presented in the most gorgeous way, no? 
Being so pricey I am not sure it is a place I plan on frequeting that often but if there is a special occasion then sure I shall stop by. 

The reason I deducted a star it is due to the location of the toilets. You have to walk outside of the restaurant to take care of business. It is located in the basement of the place and I find that annoying. I shouldnt have to mentally prepare myself to use the restroom. It is so far. Some of you call that lazy bur I call it practical."

It was a Monday night so we figured it shouldn&#39;t be too busy. Not only the hostess that greeted us, but everyone we spoke to, the service was friendly and great. 
Our server was Kelly and she was knowledgeable, helpful and extreme friendly. We were pleasantly surprised! 
I had the 14 oz Ribeye with sauteed mushrooms, truffle pomme frites, and loaded baked potato. My wife had the braised beef short rib, and we had the crab cakes for an appetizer. The food was excellent and well worth the cost.
I not only will go back, but I will recommend this place wholeheartedly.

There&#39;s a big reason for that though, I got married here.  It was so great.  The people were so good to us.

When we go here to eat though, I still think this place rocks.  It&#39;s not crowded during the week at all.  Just like some businessmen and stuff.

There is no word in the English language to use to describe how absolutely divine the food is.

They bring you out bread and crushed roasted garlic with parmesan and olive oil to start your dining experience.

One of my favorite meals is the ribeye.  But the skirt steak is good too.  If you go in fall and they have the pumpkin spice soup... GET IT!!!!! It is so amazing.  It&#39;s not sweet, more savory.  The best way I could explain it to you is that it taste like tomato soup made out of pumpkins.

Pablo is my favorite server here, as he remembers us.  Well everyone remembers us here.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just cause we got married here, but even before that... they remembered us.

The drink are awesome too!

This place makes you feel like you&#39;re spending a million dollars to eat there with prices that are comparable to Maggiano&#39;s and Other nice places.  Maybe even cheaper.

I can&#39;t believe I never reviewed this place before.  But whenever there is any reason to celebrate with me and wife... this is the place."

The hanger steak was cooked exactly as ordered and melted in my mouth. My date had the moussaka and he said &#34;hell yes&#34; when I asked was it good.  He also enjoyed the oysters I would not touch. The manager even came by to refill our water glasses and was able to tell my curious date about the materials used on the glass looking, but turned out to be not glass ceiling. My date and I had a reservation and was seated as soon as we walked in, the restaurant however, was packed and we couldn&#39;t sit near the band. After dinner when the restaurant wasn&#39;t as crowded we were able to sit near the band and really enjoy the music. If you don&#39;t finish your bottle of wine they seal it up so you can take it home so you don&#39;t feel like you HAVE to finish your bottle of wine. Had a great time and glad to have great memories."

I feel the menu is better than it has been recently since the new chef took over.  Our server Chris was excellent! Amazing server! The restaurant was extremely busy and he rocked it. Later in the lounge, we enjoyed the party favors, hats and champagne toast. The band was very lively and we danced had a great night out. I would give a 5 star except the veggies lacked refinement.

Brittiny, the social event coordinator, assisted me in making this an absolutely perfect evening.  The party was just immediate family so there were only 11 of us, and we fit perfectly in the Wall Street Room.  When I learned they had audio/video equipment available I decided to create a family photo slide presentation that we played throughout the dinner, which was a huge hit with the family - as anyone who has worked with AV equipment knows, the success of a presentation is contingent on the equipment and their equipment ran flawlessly.  

Miguel was our head waiter and he was outstanding - professional, attentive and personable.  Those assisting him were also professional and personable.  Some in our group even joked about how our water glasses were mysteriously kept filled, which speaks to how deftly the wait staff works.

Everything ran smoothly from the moment we got there until the moment we left.  The food was exceptional - from the appetizers to the dinners and then dessert.  For appetizers we ordered the seafood platter, caprese flatbread and sashimi grade blue fin tuna - all of it was excellent.   The sushi eaters in our group fought over the last pieces of tuna.  

Dinners selections in our group ranged from duck to seafood to beef - again, all excellent.  We had a couple foodies in our group and a couple picky eaters - even they were very happy with their meals.  My parents were given a complimentary cheesecake dessert, which was very thoughtful and delicious.  Everyone was also very happy with their drinks and wine selections.

I think that sums it up!  I highly recommend CityGate Grille!"

This was going to be for our daughter&#39;s upcoming Sweet Sixteen Party. When speaking with Holley over the telephone she seemed very excited in our theme,  which is The Great Gatsby,  and was very what I thought to be attentive during our conversation. When my husband and daughter arrived for our appointment and to view the proposal it was the complete opposite if our telephone conversation. Nothing that my daughter nor myself wanted  was included in the proposal. Chair covers, bows, centerpieces were were all in addition to the $9000.00 proposal. We wanted wanted a cash bar,  and buffet style dinner as 80% of our guests we age 15 and 16. The proposal included open bar, and a plated duet dinner with a party lasting only until 10 pm, when we clearly stated we needed the venue until midnight.  Weddings are their forte, obviously.  So if that&#39;s what your looking to book this venue for I&#39;m sure they are capable.  If Miss Holley would have taken they time to listen to the &#34;guest of honor&#34; and included in her proposal the wants and needs of us as well, perhaps we would have booked with them. Thankfully we found a very elegant venue just down the street for a little less, but with everything &#34;extra&#34; included into one package.  Next time listen to your client and not your own &#34;wants&#34; for their function."

Went for valentines day, weeks in advance the soonest reservation was for 930pm (which is completely understandable) but the restaurant was EMPTY... Which I found odd. 

Coat check, valet and host services were all friendly and attentive, our waiter wasn&#39;t too bad but he got frustrated with my indecision - as if there were lines of people waiting and he was trying to get us in and out as quickly as possible... Let me remind you it was after 930 and the place was near desolate! 

I asked if the salmon was farm raised or wild caught, the waiter said &#34;it&#39;s from Scotland&#34; So I repeated my question which was met with &#34;I don&#39;t know, do I need to ask?&#34; I said &#34;please&#34;, he groaned and rolled his eyes and walked away... Come to find out the salmon is farm raised ( which I refuse to eat, disgusting!!!) so I asked for another minute to look at the menu... Waiter seemed peeved... 

We ended up with a bottle of wine (that was almost triple the price on the menu than at the liquor store-because I checked- but once again that&#39;s somewhat expected), the calamari, which was nothing special and had wayyyy more garnish than squid, then
I had the asiago stuffed gnocchi, it left much to be desired and the was no asiago flavor whatsoever, straight ricotta inside, I swear. the &#34;crispy eggplant&#34; was literally just breaded fried cubes of eggplant thrown on top... Eh.
Boyfriend had steak, whipped potatoes and asparagus... Steak was cooked almost perfectly (asked for med and it was med rare but he didn&#39;t mind) So that&#39;s a plus but the asparagus was scrawny and withered-Like it was frozen or sat for hours and had been reheated more than once, he didn&#39;t comment much on the potatoes... Plating was sloppy.

Overall for an upscale restaurant with higher end pricing we avid foodies were extremely disappointed!!! They use low quality ingredients and try to dress them up in fancy names and big price tags! The plating and presentation could have made up for the lackluster flavor but that was sloppy as well. We don&#39;t mind paying high prices for food that is worthy of such, but this place has no business charging what they do for what you&#39;re actually getting!

The two stars given were for the friendly and accommodating staff, the somewhat nice atmosphere... Bonus points for the fact that it&#39;s Greek owned &amp; I support my people.

BUT:

Boyfriend and I agreed we will absolutely NOT ever be back. There are much better options in the area that use quality ingredients and are lower priced, such as Cooper&#39;s Hawk or Two Brothers Roundhouse!!!"

Very corporate/hotel-y feel, great valet service, you enter through the lobby of an office building. Do note the cool art from the Calamos Collection, very interesting self portrait of Zorba the Greek by Anthony Quinn.

Front end service was awesome; valets, hostess, coat check all friendly and attentive.

We got there well before the big &#34;NYE Party&#34; began. The main dining room is on the main level with a party space downstairs where the NYE festivities were being held.

The service and food were all great. 4 diners, all different meals; Salmon, Short Rib, Steak and Shrimp Pasta dish.

The beef dishes were great, as were there corresponding sauces, risottos, gravies.

To my taste the salmon was underdone, but that is pretty common and I probably should have made sure and asked for it medium.

Everything was well made, well presented, brought out timely and to the right person.

The space itself is great. As odd as it sounds, the view of 88 and the area around it was kinda cool at night. The bar dining room are one big area and there is bar seating as well.

Will definitely go back. It is pleasantly devoid of the downtown Naperville problems. Handsome location, strong food, reasonably priced....will definitely be back"

Before, I start, I will say the food, atmosphere and service in general were good.  

The issues we had were with the Event Staff.  The coordinator changed midway between the signing of the contract and the actual event.  The first coordinator had made multiple promises that couldn&#39;t be kept.  She had no notes of our conversations or the prices she promised us.  Fortunately, we kept meticulous notes and were able to re-negotiate to fit our budget by making some changes.  On our final meeting with the new coordinator we had discussed what to do after our event ended.  We were told very clearly that we could either to CityGate Grill until they closed or to SugarToad or Tee Time at the hotel as they were open later.  Thus no formal arrangements were needed.  

During the event our DJ was told to inform everyone that we would be going to Tee Time near the hotel after the bar closed.  Shortly after this announcement, we were pulled aside to be informed that CityGate and Tee Time would be closed and SugarToad was closed for a private party .  Thus we had 100 guests having a great time and waiting to continue celebrating together and had no where to go.  We asked what they could do to accommodate us....nothing.  They left the bar (now cash bar) open an additional 15 minutes and acted as if they were doing us a huge favor.  Conveniently, the new coordinator was nowhere to be found for this conversation, but 5 other staff members and a security guard were.  While there was one incident with one guest having mixed medication and alcohol, the party was very tame to our knowledge.  We weren&#39;t informed of any additional issues or reasons for this change in plans.  The excessive staff and security had our guests concerned and talking.  Not fun to answer 50 questions about what happened, when it was really the staff not accommodating our event and making all our guests uncomfortable.

All in all, we felt the coordination of the event was poor from the begin.  Lack of responses, changing promises, etc.  lead to MUCH unneeded stress on the planning committee.  Unfortunately, we will not be recommending this venue to the classes behind ours or to others."

My mom ordered shorts ribS.  1 rib came and it was smaller than a baseball.   We brought it up to the waitress and were told, &#34;that is how it comes&#34;.     Other than this, the atmosphere is awesome,, they have live music on weekends, and the location is convenient.   All the negatives could be overcome.  We will go back, but hope they read these notes!"

After driving past CityGate tons and tons of times, and open availability on OpenTable, I booked our 7PM reservation. From the beginning, we had a great experience. The complimentary valet was really nice, and the valet guy was super friendly.

We were seated by the window in a quiet corner, and promptly tended to by our server. She mentioned that during the summer months they offer 1/2 priced bottles of wine- which is awesome! While the menu is not huge, I found many things that I would have loved to order. My boyfriend and I both got the wedge salad and filet. The service was very prompt, my only complaint is that we recieved our entrees before finishing our salads. It&#39;s not a huge deal, but would have been nice if timed a little better. Both of our filets were cooked perfectly and each came with two sides - I choose asparagus and the three cheese mac n&#39; cheese. My boyfriend chose broccoli and carrots - both of which were delicious and very flavourful. While they offered dessert, we opted out. The menu looked fantastic though!

The atmosphere was very nice, clean, and modern. They had a live jazz band which seemed to be a big hit with those sitting at the bar. The music was not too loud and made for great background ambiance. 

Our server was super nice and attentive. I forget her name...

PS- Prior to ordering, we were served with fresh roasted garlic, a tomato mixture, and pita bread- which was very tasty!

We&#39;ll definately be back to try other menu offerings. Although CityGate is a little off the beaten path, it&#39;s nice to find a quality restaurant close to home."

The event was complicated -- we brought casino tables, a band, a photobooth, a cake and over 100 people, but everything went off without a hitch!  It was obvious that Nancy (CG&#39;s event planner) and the entire staff were invested in ensuring that we had a perfect event, and they went the extra mile in accommodating our group and making suggestions to improve the event.  The food was delicious, and the service was phenomenal.  Everyone had a great time and we are so glad that we chose CG as our venue!"

Maybe it&#39;s because the restaurant shares a lobby with an investment firm, but it felt a little like peering into the Big Boy&#39;s Club: it wouldn&#39;t phase me if a multi-million dollar Wall Street deal took place here over steaks &#39;n&#39; scotch.

Anyway, on to what matters! The waiter was extremely attentive and considerate. Even the bus boy, when pouring ice water, shielded his hand with a napkin to prevent any water from potentially splashing me. I was shocked by this move and said as much. The poor soul&#39;s demeanor suggested he may have been lashed before, god help that wayward drop of water.

A fresh basket of bread (cut into clever slivers that resembled chips) arrived alongside cloves of garlic, which the waiter crushed right in front of us with a fork! The beet and apple salad was superb, with an excellent (and light) touch of vinaigrette. And my mom had to restrain herself from licking the plate clean of her birthday dinner (mushroom dusted mahi). Solid menu, superb service, beautiful environment. I could&#39;ve sat back and watched the traffic all day."

This wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing if the food and service were on par with this lofty vision, but it isn&#39;t.

Food overall was fine. Entree portions are on the small side, so appetizers and a salad are in order. Lots of seafood, but I found some things lacking. The mussels were really small instead of being fat and luscious. The chorizo sauce that came with it was very good though. The lobster bisque was fine, but a bit skimpy on the lobster. I would have preferred chunks instead of  hairy filaments. The scallops were fine, but could have been seared more crisply outside to complement the buttery richness of the inside.

They offer a lot of fancy drinks, but don&#39;t have a solid knowledge of your classic cocktails. I asked for a negroni - Campari, gin, sweet vermouth - and they had to come back and ask what was in it. I&#39;m no cocktail snob, but really?

The decor is a rushed interpretation of luxury Euro-American with a tinge of oversized suburbia. Lots of dark stained wood and a slightly chilly feel. Service is appallingly bad. Lots of long waits yet waitstaff are seen lingering around?  We waited a while to order dessert and once more for our checks. In this case, they were working a party celebrating a really old guy&#39;s birthday with his grown children, his grandchildren, and his twenty-something girlfriend. Eeeeewwww.

If you work in the area and want to impress clients, CityGate Grille will do an adequate job. Otherwise, there are better places to go nearby, like Sugar Toad."

The place was not busy on a Saturday night so there was something not quite hitting on all cylinders.  It may be the location, but it also may be the service.  The reception staff and valet were fine; the table service was not.

The specials list was uninspiring and omitted the soup of the day.  We ordered from the main menu.

Our server was unable to describe the preparation for the bacon-wrapped dates and shrimp appetizer.  Instead he tried to explain what a date was, unsuccessfully.  Our appetizer and first course plates were cleared, along with our silverware.  No silverware was brought with the main course.  We asked for silverware and waited as our food cooled.  Finally, no help in sight, we got up and helped ourselves to silverware from the next table.

The menu was all over the place, from hamburgers to high-end steaks to seafood.  Some things lived up to the &#34;Mediterranean&#34; influence advertised, and some did not.  The bacon-wrapped date &amp; shrimp appetizer was really good -- nice crispy smoky bacon contrasted nicely with the sweet dates and shrimp.  It came with a carrot slaw which seemed to be there mostly for color - didn&#39;t really add anything to the flavor of the dish.

The lobster bisque was decent.  The crab cake appetizer, served with pearl cous-cous was average.  It lacked lumps of crab--had that beat up texture we often find, but it was served with a good olive-infused sauce.  My friend enjoyed her salad with fresh parmesan and light vinaigrette dressing.  My main course of lamb loin, garlic rapini and bleu cheese potatoes au gratin was really good.  The lamb was tender, flavorful and perfectly cooked medium rare as requested.  I would have liked more of the sauce to go with it.

Desserts were a predictable run of creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake, cheesecake, etc.  Nothing Mediterranean about it that I could tell, other than one sorbet which our server described as &#34;bloody orange.&#34;

Dinner for two with one glass of wine, tax &amp; tip was $120."

Everything about this place is great - the ambience, the food, the service -seriously, they are all top-notch.

Some of the highlights of the menu:
Spinach &amp; Bleu Cheese Salad
Caesar Salad
Crabcakes
Asiago Gnocchi
Flatbreads

A note about the Asiago Gnocchi - it comes with little crispy fried eggplant cubes on top that melt in your mouth like butter.  It is one of the most unique, whimsical, and flavorful gnocchi dishes I have ever had.  

The only thing I wasn&#39;t too thrilled with was the Chocolate Bombe, basically chocolate cake with chocolate mousse on top.  The cake was quite dry and it was cold, as if they just took it out of the freezer for a few minutes to unthaw.  I expect a much better dessert for $9.  

Note: they also have a bar menu that&#39;s worth looking into with $2 sliders served on mini brioche buns (burger, crabcake, tempura sea bass, or bistro steak sliders).  So for a minimal cost, you can sit in the bar area, order a drink and three sliders, and see if you like the food."

Seared to perfection.  Others in our group had the filet which was also cooked perfect (med rare).  We also had the salmon bruchetta which is nothing like any other bruchetta I&#39;ve ever had.   No tomatoes at all, had salmon, capers, eggs and a white sauce it was excellent though!  Good beer choices too.   Highly recommend."

Great Caesar salad, we both order the filet and were a little disappointed with the cuts. Mine was not a center-cut that we are accustomed to. However, the flavor overshadowed the mediocre cut. My husband&#39;s cut was a much better cut than mine. The green beans were amazing. Stayed for dessert and got the creme brûlée and tiramisu and both were top notch!! Will probably return to try some other menu options."

It was pleasantly decorated for the Christmas holiday in a modern but spirited feel. You have the option of wanting to watch sports or just chat with you friends. It was nice because the waiter didn&#39;t even rush us at all.  We ended up being there for 3 hours.  

The house starts you off by bringing out roasted garlic with parmesan and pita triangles that are amazing.  Plan ahead if you are going on a date because you don&#39;t want to have to miss out on the garlic.  My friend wasn&#39;t going to have any but I was able to twist her arm and then she couldn&#39;t stop it was so good. The Pita triangles also come with butter and a roast red pepper dip that was pretty good. 

My friend had ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer and they were great.  Full of crabby  goodness.   I had ordered the caprese salad which was very surprising. I was totally not expecting a two of tomato&#39;s and mozzeralla. The presentation was great. The chef was not shy on the balsamic.  I could have used one more slice of mozzeralla but I am not going to complain.  

Now to our amazing main courses. My friend had got the dinner special which was a seafood risotto which had lobster and shrimp.  It was very taste but very rich. I you are in the mood for a rich dish it is the one for you. Me myself I was torn I couldn&#39;t really decide what I wanted. I was waviering between the steaks and the risotto&#39;s.   Being the foodie that I am I can be alittle pick. So I finally decided on the steak risotto. I figured I could get a little of both.  The dish I got was not at all what I expected. I had assumed that I would get a risotto with small pieces of steak in it. Well that was not what I got. It was a steak with a side of risotto. The steak which was a skirt steak was cooked perfectly.  The risotto was a cream lite side with pearl onions , mushrooms, asparagus and spinach. It was amazing.  I did make a good choice.  

To finish off the evening we closed with an order of the Tirimasu.  It was fabulous. The perfect mix of coffee and Kahlua.   It is a good restaurant to celebrate a holiday. it is also nice because you can actually hear yourself talk. The back ground music is not to loud.  The drink specials are also very good."

You&#39;ll first have to venture into Calamos Holdings and make a left and venture down this long hallway, making yourself second guess if you are going to the right place. Ah, finally to your right, before you walk down the stairs is CityGate Grille, somewhat hidden to the untrain eyes. 

I was politely greeted by the host and when I told her I was meeting with with someone she told me I can have a seat. Exactly where? The only seating was couches that didn&#39;t belong to the restaurant, but more to the building itself (hence it being located outside of the restaurant). 

Anywho as we were were seated for lunch I was at awe at how modern and sophisticated the restaurant was. A great atmosphere with a full bar and private dining rooms for special events.

As we sat for lunch, we were greeted by our server and he took our drink orders, water for me please. I ended up ordering the Lobster Bisque and Philly Ribeye Sandwich. This has been at least 2 weeks ago and I can still smell the delicious aroma and taste the smooth, creaminess of the Lobster Bisque. By the end I was literally licking my bowl clean (actually imagining it because doing such things in public is not really acceptable). The Philly Ribeye Sandiwch has an upperhand on other so called Philly Steaks. Served with a side of crispy, hot fries the ribeye was juicy and well seasoned.  

HmmMmmm it&#39;s getting frosty out, a bowl of bisque will do me right."

We sat in the bar area and there was live music yesterday evening.  I had the special Grouper and my wife had the 8 finger cavatelli.  The fish was fantastic, light and flaky and had a great lobster sauce with it and the pasta was prepared perfectly.  The kitchen is generating some great food in Naperville and CityGate is a real hidden gem.  As a baker, the desserts were great and the tiramisu was HUGE.  It was flavorful and light, a great way to end the evening.  My bread pudding was just as good, a great rendition of the traditional dessert.  Great service, attentive without being over the top.

Somewhat hard to find as it is in an office complex and further back than where you&#39;d expect, but keep looking.  Not much in the way of signs.

My husband and I wanted to try something off the beaten path that had good food and live music.  CityGate Grille exceeded our expectations by providing exceptional food, great live music, and outstanding service!    We started our meal with a lemon chicken soup that was delicious.  My husband ordered the half chicken that was served over potatoes.  The presentation of the food was awesome and the meal was cooked to perfection.  I ordered the perfect &#34;winter night&#34; dish -  a generous piece of braised beef, a sweet potato, and brussel sprouts cooked with bacon (soooo good).  Every part of the dish was absolutely exquisite.  It was one of the most delicious restaurant meals I have eaten in a long time.  We split the flour less chocolate cake to end our perfect meal and it did not disappoint.  Our server&#39;s name was Chris and he gave wonderful suggestions, was extremely pleasant, and paid very close attention to our needs.  As a matter of fact, the entire wait staff was super attentive.  Our water glasses were always full and our dishes cleared immediately.

It&#39;s located in the same building as an investment firm.  The restrooms are on the lower floor and you can peek into the firm&#39;s cafeteria.  There are a lot of businesses and office parks in the area so it&#39;s a good place to take a client or have a nicer meeting over lunch.

The restaurant has a business type atmosphere but I could also see how in the evening it could turn into a nice steakhouse restaurant.  I ordered a soup and salad and both were served quickly, were reasonably priced and decent tasting.  The food wasn&#39;t particularly outstanding, it was just OK.  The serves know that lunchtime has to be a quick turnaround so it&#39;s impressive that they turn out a decent meal so quickly.

I don&#39;t know what else is in the area but I could see folks coming here for dinner or grabbing a drink in the evening.  Seems like a place for more mature crowds.  Couldn&#39;t see myself here doing a social thing but maybe in a few years if I find myself living in the western suburbs.  It&#39;s OK, served the purpose for what I was there for."

I&#39;ve also tried the gnocci with crispy eggplant (delicious) and the roasted chicken. The steaks are also very good. The only thing that I didn&#39;t like was the rapini served with the roasted chicken.  It was very bitter.

The drinks are boozy and there is free live music on Fridays and Saturdays, which makes for quite an entertaining night out.  There&#39;s a bar menu with inexpensive sliders and apps."

The atmosphere of the restaurant is divided into three sections.  The bar area, which is sectioned off by a wall of glass, the main area, and one large area for big parties.  

I had to lobster tail, and it was delicious.  However, my favorite part of the meal was the appetizer they supply, a garlic paste and pita chips.  Absolutely delicious!!  It is a bit pricey, so be prepared to spend around $45-$50 a person if you want steak or seafood and wine."

Our food was delicious and included the Skirt steak, lobster bisque, Fillet, Greek yogurt cheesecake, Cobbler, two bottles of Merlot, etc.  The Merlot was on the more affordable side and it was excellent.  We had a wonderful time and highly recommend CityGate Grille for any occasion, be it a special occasion or just lunch or dinner.  Great service and atmosphere.  Thank you Nancy and Pablo!"

Truly disappointed with the steak (if you call that steak) and the rest was average at best. I&#39;ve been to a lot of weddings and the food was near the bottom for this one, but the venue was pretty, especially the outdoor seating area."

The staff was very accommodating and our waiter was attentive .  My friends all had the porterhouse steak and I had the steak risotto.  The risotto was wonderful and you get a generous portion of skirt steak.  Our portabella flatbread was a wonderful starter plate .  Dessert was nothing exciting. The live band was great.  It was a nice space to have a dinner for a special occasion .  Be prepared to spend money , risotto was 25 dollars and their steaks were 47.   I would go again for the bar menu and music."

A $500 disaster.  New Year&#39;s Eve, party of seven.  We experienced the worst service I have seen in more then ten years.  The wait staff while friendly was awful. We were at the table thirty minutes before they took our drink order, then they brought out incorrect drinks. One hour into experience we had to ask for them to take out entree order.  The food servers had to ask which entrees were supposed to go to the people seated at the table.  

After they brought the wrong entree to one in our party, they then added a $35.00 surcharge called Bad Quality.  When we questioned the manager about it, he was argumentative.  They did finally remove the charge. The entire experience was a perfect example of how not to treat customers or run a restaurant.  There are many great restaurants in Naperville, this is not one of them."

The Scallops on a bed of risotto are AMAZING.  I can&#39;t help myself but to get them every time I go."

It&#39;s in a not so good location because no one would ever think about going into an area of corporate offices for dinner. So I actually think this makes the restaurant one of the best kept secrets in Naperville.

My mom found a $20 coupon in the Women&#39;s Health magazine (free at banks). I take my parents out to eat every Thursday. That Thursday my mom was giddy (aka drunk) with happiness. $3 mixed drinks on Thu...she had 2 amaretto sours. 

The calamari app was eh. There was something weird about the breading...I can&#39;t put my finger on it. 

However after plates were passed around and every one got a bite of everyone else&#39;s food every one insisted that their own plate was the best and was super awesome. I had the SMOKED SEA BASS with sweet potato &amp; brussel sprout slaw, kalamata jam. I was a little disappointed when it came out and it did not look like it was smoked. I think they just write that on the menu b/c it sounds good? However the presentation was beautiful. The fish was on a cedar plank and the jam was used as garnish around the plate. The brussel sprout slaw was a little too salty and too vinegary. There are obviously still some kinks for this restaurant to iron out. But it&#39;s definitely on the right track."

Arrived at 2PM and never saw another soul there the whole time we were there, but it didn&#39;t matter. It is definitely in a weird spot, so you have to look for it and know it&#39;s there. Anyhow, the place is decorated nicely and has a swanky atmosphere. 

We got an appetizer of mushrooms on flatbread which was quite delicious....crisp, buttery. 
Shared a bottle of pinot grigio with my wife and she ordered the gnocchi with caprese and fried eggplant cubes. Was a great dish...quite innovative and done nicely. I had the halibut special with a crabcake on the top, and a rich caper sauce, brocolli rabe, and whipped potatoes. Nicely done.
I have to put a nice note here, as I had a little communication problem with the waiter on the price of the wine specials. I had put it in a previous review, but I received a note from manager and was refunded the money I overpaid for a  wine special. That was above and beyond their call of duty, and I certainly appreciated it. It appears customer service is high on their list, and I am adding a star to my personal rating..........
We&#39;ll definitely go back and try some other dishes."

It was not crowded, featured attentive, knowledgeable staff, and well-prepared, delicious food.

We started with the hummus trio, compliments of our check-in with Yelp, and were overwhelmed with the appetizer. Plenty of warm, tasty flatbread to dip in three very different hummus selections. Lots of food for two people, and we even managed to take a little home for a late-night snack.

My wife tried a Halibut special that night and I chose the Skirt Steak Risotto. Her fish was lovely, and was presented as described. As for the risotto, I imagined it to be prepared as written, featuring small pieces of steak scattered throughout. I was pleasantly surprised when I was presented with a large serving of a savory risotto AND about a 4oz portion of a delicious marinated Skirt Steak.

The atmosphere at City Gate was fresh and chic, yet comfortable and accessible. Great job to everyone involved in this establishment. We will definitely make plans to return!"

My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here, from start to finish. Here&#39;s why:

- We had no trouble getting a reservation during &#34;prime time&#34; on a Saturday night. They also honored our reservation request to be seated by the windows but there really isn&#39;t a bad table in the place which is saying a lot considering its size

- The restaurant itself is beautiful. It is spacious and has a lovely upscale feel to it. One wall has tw-story floor to ceiling windows that look out on a corporate pond lined with huge lit evergreen trees and I-88 (which surprisingly gives off a good energy vibe). The view can be enjoyed from any table in the restaurant. The bar looked very nice and it appeared you could eat there, as well.

- The menu had many choices and our food was excellent! Entrees included steaks, seafood, house specialties that included pasta, some Greek dishes, and nightly specials. There even was a black angus burger so really, something for everyone! We both had their salmon with pasta and sweet peas in a lemon-parmesan cream sauce, a special that was both unique and delicious! We also really enjoyed the appetizers that we selected: skirt steak mini-kabobs, as well as bacon wrapped shrimp and goat cheese stuffed dates, each with its own delicious sauce but there were at probably ten to choose from. We&#39;re glad we saved some room for dessert. There were many tempting choices but we selected the key lime tarte and flourless chocolate ganache cake, both made in-house. We loved them both. There were also flatbreads on their menu and excellent salad possibilities which are also offered as half-portions, a nice idea! We saw many of reasons to come back.

- All of the wait staff (but a special shout-out to our waitress Daniela!) was attentive, knowledgeable, and there was never a language barrier issue with anyone who came to our table. It&#39;s clear that they have all been well-trained.

- The manager was also very attentive to the patrons. We found him to be personable and committed to giving us a good experience.

-  This restaurant is not at all noisy. You&#39;ll be able to converse easily with members of your dinner party instead of straining to hear, a common problem in the downtown Naperville restaurants once it gets crowded.

- Parking is a breeze. You can either use their free valet service or park your own car. If you do the parking, you&#39;ll be no more than 75 feet from the door

While CityGate Grille is off the beaten path of the downtown Naperville restaurants, we think that&#39;s one of its positives aspects. We weren&#39;t sure what to expect after Riva left but we walked out saying, &#34;Well done, CityGate Grille! We will be back!&#34;"

They had a good crowd in the restaurant and several people in the bar area. We grabbed two seats at the bar, and Katie had dinner while I had a few beers and some apps. Neil, our FAVORITE bartender, was working and took great care of us.

I love sitting in the bar, two large screen tvs behind the bar, good cocktails and cold beer (what else does a man need?). Its comfortable, and the redecoration of the joint looks great!

The tomato soup is FABULOUS, and Katie loved the mussels, salad, and especially the cobbler for dessert.

Great evening, excellent food, and warm/friendly service.

We had early reservations and were seated right away by a friendly hostess. The waiter however never cracked a smile or asked if it was a special occasion even though two of us were carrying gift bags...This was a birthday celebration for two people but they never bothered to ask. After drink orders were placed the waiter brought roasted garlic and a bowl of olive oil but no bread...Ummm...It took like ten minutes to get a small basket of pita wedges and super thin parm crackers to our table which also came with some sort of tomato (bland) sauce. They kept pushing drinks on us which I thought was weird until I got my salad. How can you screw up a Caesar salad? Well, you use store bought croutons, skip the anchovies and go light on the shaved parm. Oh, and you barely drizzle dressing on it. Bland and boring. A friend had the spinach salad which looked okay and my hub got the wedge salad with bacon and ranch which he loved. Our entrees were so-so. I had the gnocchi which was really rich and the sauce overwhelmed the dumplings. I ate maybe half. My husband got the steak with risotto which was bland and boring. 
The wine and drinks were top shelf however the food was sadly lacking. Will I go back? Probably not, there are plenty of tasty places in the area with friendly service."

The location is in the lobby of an office building off of Rte 59 and I-88.  It was a Thursday evening and our party of 12 were the only ones in the restaurant.

I ordered the mushroom flatbread for my appetizer.  It was borderline burnt and too crispy.  My 1st choice was not available so I had to settle for the pork medallions.  The menu did not mention that they were fried.  I found the dish to be too oily and salty.  I was barely able to eat one of the two medallions.  The service was a but a bit over the top and came across as trying too hard

I now understand why the restaurant was empty.  I will not be returning."

Apps came out shortly after, and the main course, I had a ribeye blackened and it was amazing... seriously best steak I&#39;ve had in a long time.

our friends came in as we were finishing up, looking for recommendations.  what else could we say but EVERYTHING!?

while everything was delish, my personal faves were the caprese flatbread (big chunks of grape tomates and loaded with fresh mozzerella, but barely braised!  not a melted hunk of goo at all...)...the baked apple crisp dessert was unbelievable and i&#39;m not even really a dessert person...and, i&#39;m a sucker for dates, but dates with chorizo?  wow.

my friend had the sea bass with this amazing sweet potato bake and a weird-sounding but so good brussel sprout slaw?!  yum!!

i feel compelled to say that everyone (except the reviewer who detests truffles) loved the truffle flat bread too.

the service was fabulous, completely attentive but not overbearing.

the prices were fairly reasonable , i&#39;d say, especially given the quality.

i dined at sugar toad last night and while i commend them for their creativity, citygate blows them away.  even citygate&#39;s wine was better - conundrum?  my fave.  half price tuesday nights?  it&#39;s worth a trip to the ville!

the location is a bit odd like everyone said, but given i was staying at hotel arista, i had no complaints.

thanks for a great dinner!!"

Very urban feel to the bar and a nice sized private dining room. We came for a late dinner Saturday night with 4 couples and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the live music. The menu is varied from pastas to scallops and veal chops but the winner of the night was their flat bread selection!  Several of the ladies opted for a salad and a flat-bread as their meal and they were not disappointed! The flat breads are crisp, buttery delicious and topped with a variety of offerings from caprese to mushrooms. Yum!  I opted for a lobster ravioli and it was sweet, succulent and just  the right size portion. The wine list was a very nice surprise with great selections and reasonable prices.

Our entrees took 45 minutes to come out after we finished our appetizers (with no apology or even recognition at the length of waiting time). 

My daughter was coloring with her crayons and the owner came by and actually asked us if they were our crayons or if HER restaurant had provided them. Should the owner not know such details?

The &#34;pastitio&#34; was spaghetti with meat sauce - and not a very good one. Our server didn&#39;t ask how it was until our plates had been cleared. When we told him it wasn&#39;t very good, he responded, &#34;Well, the chef isn&#39;t Greek so.....sorry.&#34; And that was it. The busser had first asked us how the meal was and when we responded, she actually offered to get us something else. She obviously was more polished than the server.

At 50% (during opening week), it was overpriced and a bad value. I can&#39;t imagine paying full price."

It&#39;s still decent for its price but I feel like the quality of food has declined. 
I just received my delivery and they forgot my rice. When I called the girl on the phone first suggested I could just come pick it up...duh that goes against why I ordered delivery in the first place. In the end she gave me credit because I was not about to wait 30 minutes for rice. Even though she suggested a dumb thing she was still very nice. 
My seaweed salad is great.
But the my entree Kung Bao chicken is so bland and the veggies are almost raw. Really not good at all. 
This happened to me last time too..my food was bland. And the protein was way overdone. 
I am not sure why the quality has gone down because I used to be a fan. I am afraid I probably won&#39;t be using that brown rice credit."

The sushi here is good, not the best I&#39;ve had but definitely good and a great location. 

The ambiance is very calm, clean, and relaxing. The staff is very nice and attentive. 

They have a great lunch special , $9 for two maki rolls from the basic list, or $11 for three rolls ! That&#39;s an amazing price. However for dinner they bump up the price to $15 for the Maki Combo and it&#39;s three set rolls which are California , Rock n Roll, and shrimp tempura. $15 is still a fairly good price if you average about $6-7 for a roll. I also love how they don&#39;t pack on the rice in the rolls. I hate when places make the rolls so it&#39;s almost all rice! This place doesn&#39;t do that and they give very generous amount of avocado which is my favorite in maki rolls!

Will continue to come back seeing as though it is good and close to my house :)"

From first glance, it may not seem like something as extravagant as say Tsukasa and alike, but the interior is tasteful. The staff is friendly and attentive. The people that own the restaurant are very pleasant and hard-working. 

On to the food. The sushi is excellent. The fish is of high quality, and each roll out of the some odd 7 or so we had was well-prepared and incredibly flavorful. The tuna specifically was a gorgeous ruby red color, and unlike many competitors, their fish does not have the overbearing, previously frozen fishy  smell that I despise.

The Tom Yum soup was good. The rest not so much. I ordered: spicy tuna (bland), tuna w/avocado and a crispy salmon skin roll (not crispy and it smelled fishy). I can only guess by the total of 3 tables it difficult to keep fresh fish. I&#39;ve deduced all my fish was frozen. Even the soy sauce was flavorless. My son got the chicken hibachi- loved it and ate every bit of it. No one asked me why I never touched the salmon skin hand roll and it wasn&#39;t taken off of my bill. Again, boy am I disappointed.

I&#39;m still leery of these restaurants with &#34;multi-Asian&#34; offerings, though more of them seem to be doing better than a few years back when they tried to be masters of all cuisines and jacks of none.

I went here for lunch and opted for a tekka maki roll as an appetizer and an order of chicken pad thai, medium spicy for my entrée. Everything was served in a timely manner and all of the food looked great on the plate. The tekka maki was good; a healthy portion of tuna in each. Then came the pad thai. As lunch portions go for pad thai, it was a little smaller than what I&#39;ve normally seen, but not outrageously so. The noodles were a little different, thinner than normal and there weren&#39;t as many bean sprouts as to what I am accustomed to having. But here was the kicker...  as the waitress, set it down, she stated, &#34;Chicken pad thai, extra spicy&#34;.  YEEEEEEOOOOooooowwww. 

Now of course I knew I could have returned or refused it, but I&#39;ve had hot food before, so I thought I&#39;d just roll with it. Well, it was spicier than &#34;medium&#34; no doubt, but in the scheme of things, it wasn&#39;t all that much hotter. Even though the dish seemed to be glowing with &#34;red heat&#34; that seemingly wanted to scald my &#34;medium spicy tastebuds&#34;.  

I&#39;ll be heading back again sometime."

The only think I&#39;ve had there that I consistently like is the coconut fried rice. The ambiance is definitely lacking and there&#39;s usually only a few tables of people in there eating at a time.

There were 6 of us looking for something to eat while we waited in the waiting room at the hospital. After looking around the area I found this place and it sounded good as the reviews were good. I drove there and the hostess Maddie took my order and offered some suggestions as well. Once the order was taken I walked over to where the sushi was being prepared and watched in aw as artwork was being created. I watch the chef put together an order on a to-go tray not knowing it was mine, and I wished I ordered what he was preparing. LOL He did a great job of setting up a wonderful presentation of our food. When I returned to the hospital we all dug in and enjoyed every last morsel.

 I only found out about this little strip mall joint because I literally work a half block away and the owner would drop off menus. I decided to try it one day because they delivered and I love Asian cuisine. To my surprise the food was excellent! I liked it so much I decided to make it the destination for my birthday dinner, they did not disappoint.
 I was greeted by friendly staff and the owner made it a point to personally serve and entertain my group and I for the night. We got a handful of rolls which were each delicious. We also got an order of panang curry chicken which was also great! My favorite rolls of the night were the pink lady, which was full of robust flavor with a bit of spice which made each bite more enjoyable than the next. I also indulged in crazy roll , fresh, fresh , fresh...the succulent fish just melted and it was beyond words. When it came to my birthday desert they turned off all the lights in the restaurant and brought out the beautifully decorated plate of friend bananas, ice cream and a slice of cheese  cake...

The whole experience from start to finish was delightful. I went back again just recently and was greeted by name by the owner (makes you feel right at home) nice personal touch. Again I left happy and full. Yummy Asian bistro is now one of my new favorites, I wish this new restaurant the best of luck! I know I&#39;ll be coming back soon!"

An hour and a half later, 3 people in our party had to ask for their Thai chicken salad to go, since they had not yet been served.

We had previously avoided the place due to the silly name, the fact that the place has been several different restaurants in the past few years, and our skepticism about the menu. But then we read the rave reviews on Yelp and had to give it a try! 

The staff was very friendly and helpful and we were surprised and delighted by the fresh sushi! We had several rolls plus a plate of nigiri. Our only complaint about the rolls was that in many the fish was chopped up and it was not spicy as the menu indicated. But the flavor was very good and the presentation was beautiful! The nigiri was outstanding, especially the super white tuna!

We also sampled one of the Thai dishes, the Thai Cashew shrimp, along with the coconut fried rice. Amazing flavor!! The Cashew shrimp had large, fresh shrimp that were perfectly cooked in a luscious sauce flavored with Thai basil. The coconut fried rice was a perfect complement, sweet and delicious!

We will definitely be back!"

All of their hot dishes are light and not over sauced like most places tend to deliver. Love the sushi bar and Charlie (Owner/Sushi Chef) is fun to watch and enjoys taking to his customers. The two main waiters (Jim and Lee) know there menu and make a lot of great suggestions. They even deliver if you do not want to sit down dor lunch or dinner.

First off the service was excellent. With really nice staff , the menu wasn&#39;t as large as I would think , I guess if you like sushi then it would be fine ,  but I can&#39;t figure out if its a Japanese or Thai restaurant. They have a little of each , I just wish they had a spicer noodle dish  than plain Lo mien noodles  but il come back here and give it another try, because the staff was great and the atmosphere was surprisingly nice ."

The only thing to make it a 5 star restaurant is if they gave an option to choose dishes with pork.  But they dont for some reason.  Been to chinese restaurants all over and they all offer pork selections.  Here the chef does not want to add to the menu.  ?

HOLY COW it was amazing and beautiful and friendly and fast and everything I could ever want! First, they completely remodeled, making the interior chic-er than anything I&#39;ve ever seen in the 60021. Second, the sushi was some of the freshest I&#39;ve ever had in land-locked IL. I didn&#39;t see a heli-pad on the roof, but I can&#39;t figure out how else they&#39;re getting such awesomely fresh tuna and salmon. No fishy aftertaste whatsoever. Third, they were SUPER accommodating and friendly when it came to my gluten-free requests. It&#39;s already embarrassing and difficult enough to deal with a food allergy, so when a place makes you feel like you&#39;re imposing by making special requests, it can really ruin a night out. Yummy jumped on my first question about a particular sauce, and immediately suggested several gluten-free options, and ultimately customized a dish for me. I ended up with the veggie, GF, pineapple fried rice, and it was delicious (never would have imagined fried rice with raisins, but now I doubt I&#39;ll happily eat it any other way). I simply can&#39;t wait for my husband to work late one night soon so I can get a whole carton of take-out for myself. I think it will pair divinely with bad Netflix B movies. BUT, that&#39;s not to say I didn&#39;t enjoy eating it in the comfortable, beautifully remodeled restaurant. My husband got General Tao&#39;s chicken and he inhaled it. It smelled fantastic and I know he&#39;s also looking forward to a repeat performance soon. My only complaint is with this place now being open, and so close to Dominick&#39;s, I may never go grocery shopping or cook anything ever again... it&#39;s so much easier, and tastier, to just pick up, or stop in, at Yummy!"

We live about 10 min. away, so it&#39;s close.  The PROS: Food is very fresh, whether you order Sushi, Thai, Chinese, etc. The two owners are acclaimed NY Sushi chefs, and their talents definitely are obvious.  We&#39;ve had several different items, from different cuisines at the restaurant, and there was nothing that we were disappointed with.  CONS:  The pricing is a bit aggressive for Fox River Grove, Ill which is a sleepy Middle Class / Average Income community.  Based on the pricing, it seems to me that this restaurant would be better placed maybe on the North Shore.  We&#39;d like to visit more often, but our family categorizes this restaurant and the kind of place where we&#39;d go to &#34;treat&#34; ourselves, and not the Go-To order-out Chinese food / Sushi place that we&#39;d stop at on any given Wednesday night when I didn&#39;t feel like cooking."

My wife and I got to the restaurant at about 8:00 on a Saturday night, and there were only about three tables taken.  We were seated immediately and given menus by the hostess.  We looked over the menus...and looked....and looked....and then looked again.  10 minutes passed before I even saw a server in the dining room.  Over the next 15 minutes I made eye contact with the server 4 times, each time motioning him over to our table only to have him disappear back into the kitchen for a few more minutes.  Finally, after waiting for nearly a half an hour without a single person stopping by our table, he finally came by.  No introduction, no apology for taking so long, no water, no specials, no anything.  Just &#34;Are you ready to order?&#34;  At that point we said no and left.  Would have liked to have tried the food, but after waiting for nearly a half hour just to have someone acknowledge that we were even in the restaurant we didn&#39;t want to know how long it would have taken to get our food.  As we walked out, the hostess asked if everything was ok, and we told her that we were leaving cause the server was taking too long.  She gave a very unsurprised, &#34;oh, ok&#34; as we walked out."

All servers help one another for the best customer experience, and go there enough they will learn your preferences.

I&#39;ve also had their tongue tacos and torta which was very good not too big in size like some other places but reasonable for price.

If you are looking for a place that is reasonably priced, has fresh ingredients, and delicious at the same time, this is your place. On a nice day, choose outdoor seating. Even though it is along the highway, you can&#39;t see it. You can see the occasional train that passes by which is also fun, especially for the kids.

I can&#39;t get past the look or blandness of these salsa here.....I know some people love it, but to me it was kind of tasteless.......and the color itself was strange.

The owner was walking around when we were there and was extremely friendly and even brought us an appetizer to try on the house as well as a couple tacos to try as it was our first time there.

The tacos were fantastic and they make one hell of a good margarita! 

They have a cute little outdoor enclosed patio which is nice on good weather nights out with friends.

Dining in is nice, good service and all, but Friday night is Dateline and who doesn&#39;t enjoy some rice n&#39; beans while yelling at the TV &#34;it was the husband! The husband killed  her!&#34;. I digress. Everything is fresh, avocado slices are generous, and our orders are always accurate to what we requested. My favorite vegetarian choices are combo plate #2 and combo plate #6. #2 is what I like to call a &#34;Mexican tea party&#34; because it&#39;s a tiny little burrito, a tiny little quesadilla, and a normal sized tostada. It&#39;s the perfect amount of food and the little portions (seriously they&#39;re adorable) allow you to try several things in one sitting. #6 includes a delicious swamp (believe it or not, this is a positive review) of cheese and red sauce. In the swamp is a homemade chile relleno, a cheese enchilada, and a bean taco island sitting atop it all. Another favorite here are the sopes. You can make a meal out of two. I&#39;ve also tried the shrimp tacos, which were fresh and spicy! Carnivore husband enjoys the carnitas (shredded pork) burrito. The burritos have rice and beans in them, so I would recommend skipping the &#34;meal&#34;, which adds rice and beans on the side. But if you&#39;re really hungry, by all means, meal it up. The patio is nice in the summer, which is coincidentally when most episodes of Dateline are reruns.

While picking him up, I recalled the favorable reviews of El Sombrero that I had read here at Yelp, so I suggested going there for dinner.

My daughter had the steak taco dinner, my son had a steak burrito, my husband had chiles rellenos and I had the chicken enchiladas mole.

We were all very impressed with the friendly service and the quality of the food.  Everything was tasty and the portions were plentiful.  We ate every last bite, and we will definitely be back!"

Neither of us had ever been here before and so we were flying blind, based only on the other reviews on this site. Since then, I have been back several times with my husband and it is quickly becoming a favorite place.

The atmosphere is a little &#34;cafeteria-like&#34; with the florescent lighting in the ceiling and plain-Jane tables.  Don&#39;t let that throw you.  The food is outstanding!  The margaritas are some of the best I have ever had.  They even come in their own iced shaker so it&#39;s really like getting two margaritas for the price of one.  Delish!

The service is great - in fact, on my second visit, the waiter who served me and my friend on my first visit recognized me and welcomed me back.  I highly recommend the steak tacos.  My husband loved the combo he got which included a chili relleno, a taco and an enchilada.  He said everything was great and especially liked that the chili relleno wasn&#39;t a greasy mess.  

I cannot wait to go back."

Have eaten at Wildwood many times, granted mainly for lunch and brunch,  and find the food most delicious and the wait staff wonderful. My favorite experience is sitting outside on their beautiful patio during the warm season and dining on their fabulous Yellow Fin Tuna or Salmon salads - most generous portions for very reasonable prices - not to mention their superb huge cheese and fruit platter.

I love the Sunday brunch with many options and the few times we had dinner enjoyed the food tremendously but found the prices a bit steep. And yes their Thanksgiving Dinner is simply to die for.

Told our order got in after a table of 25 but shouldn&#39;t they prepare for that?. Also other than  that table the restaurant was empty. Then had the Seabass and spent the next 2 days in the bathroom. Interesting I see other people have said they also got sick after eating the fish.  

Also not good with substitutions. Once I asked for extra lobster on my sandwich and they said they couldn&#39;t do it even if I paid. Then my father in law asked to substitute spinach for another vegetable and they said they could delete it and he could pay for another side. Terrible for a so called higher end restaurant. 

Also my wife&#39;s steak was un-chewable of that&#39;s even a word.

Forgot to mention all the food was cold. Stay away. Much better places to spend money and eat in Geneva.  Even Taco Bell would be an improvement."

This was a huge bone in ribeye and was the one killer entree that elevated this restaurant to a superior dining experience.  Unfortunately suppliers will for whatever reason discontinue an item and such is the case in this instance. 

The biggest problem with this restaurant is that the menu items are just good.  Something on the menu really needs to be at least best in class to make the dining experience memorable. 

The Thanksgiving dinner is a solid four stars. Both beef and turkey are included and an extensive selection of holiday side dishes not normally on the menu is featured. The dinner is designed so that leftovers will be available. Despite the fact that the restaurant was full we were served efficiently. 

Unfortunately, this is one of those instances where good is just not good enough and Holiday dinners don&#39;t come around very often."

I was apprehensive about coming due to reviews but my sister in law set it up. We were seated before our reservation of 6 PM and our waitress, Stacy, was great. She made a great wine recommendation. Service throughout the evening was not an issue.

We ordered a few starters- blueberry pork belly, tuna tartar, and bacon wrapped dates. The pork and tuna tasted great (although I do prefer avocado with my tartar). The dates, on the other hand, were cold. We altered the waitress and they were comped.

Most everyone enjoyed their entrees. My lamb chops were a smaller portion for the price but tasty. Two entrees were not enjoyed- the whitefish (too oily) and the NY Strip was very fatty. 

Pieces of cake with candles were brought out for all the birthdays and it was delicious!

Bottom line: 2 out of 6 entrees being poor is ridiculous for the price we paid for this dinner. The prices here are asinine and the food did not meet the expectations of the price point. I was thinking of much better meals I have had at a more reasonable price. The service was the saving grace to this meal."

Visited on Sunday Aug 28 about 12:30 with two other couples. Place was about a third occupied. We have had in the past an excessive wait time to have a waiter offer us drinks, and food delivery, but thought we&#39;d give them another chance. 

It took about 15 minutes to have waiter do our drink order, Then waiter about 15 more to deliver the drinks, then disappeared. 15 more minutes we flagged him down to place our food order. Another 30 minutes to get our food. I complained to the manager to no avail. So it took an hour and fifteen minutes before we were actually eating. 

Chicken salad on a roll  had little flavor and mostly lettuce, Crab Cakes were super tiny and mostly lettuce,  Burger I&#39;m told was OK

Had to flag down the waiter again to bring our check, and took him another 15 min come back to collect. So in total it took us an hour and a half to have lunch. 

Second time this has happened. No more--we&#39;re done with Wildwood"

We arrived around 11 am and it wasn&#39;t terribly busy. I wouldn&#39;t agree with other yelpers (it wasn&#39;t empty), but it was probably about 50% full. Maybe I look at the glass half full, not half empty.

Anyway, we sat down and someone came over relatively quickly (within minutes) and took our drink order. Coffee for me, orange juice for him. They should really upgrade their coffee cups. 3 sips in, I was nearly done with my coffee. 

She returned in a few minutes and took our food order. We received beignets and fruit prior to our meal and enjoyed them. Then waited for our food. And waited some more..and some more. About twenty minutes later, our waitress came back to our table and told us she had lost our order, and never turned it in. Um...ok. Just as we were telling her our order again, she reached in her pocket and said &#34;oh, here it is! Never mind!&#34; and rushed off. So we then waited for our food some more.

My french toast was good, and a very large portion as well. 3 full pieces of toast plus 4 pieces of bacon and a spattering of breakfast potatoes. My husband enjoyed his meal as well. He had the blueberry pancakes.

Another star taken away for drinks. I drank all my coffee and all my water and had to flag our waitress down for refills. There was someone walking around filling up water and coffee, but it seemed like he would just walk through the restaurant, then disappear.

Our waitress did apologize for the service, and comped our drinks (saving us a whopping $5). I&#39;ll take it, I guess.

The food was great, prices were ideal for a nice restaurant, but the service was really lacking. I guess my review does echo the other reviews, after all."

Didn&#39;t matter, because I took three bites and stopped eating. I&#39;ve never done that before, but it just wasn&#39;t good. There was absolutely no seasoning or flavor to the chicken or stuffing. The lingonberry sauce was ok, but it made a strange combination with the chicken and whatever was inside of it.

There are several reasons from start to finish why this place will not get my business again and why I think others should be weary of going there also. 

-The server said we could not push tables together even though we had planned on ordering food and staying all night to drink and listen to music- while just twenty feet away there were two tables pushed together by people (who appeared to regulars) and who had taken extra chairs from other tables. 

-When we asked the server if we could grab some chairs from the bar that weren&#39;t being used she said no that&#39;s not allowed.  However ten minutes later the owner/manager (I&#39;m not sure what his role was) who had been sitting at the bar drinking got up and brought his chair over to a table of women that had come in and were short one stool.

-I ordered a Manhattan on the rocks and when the server brought it out it was served up. I wouldn&#39;t have asked for another except that she didn&#39;t seem to know what my look was for or that the drink was not how I ordered it.  I do not feel bad for her messing up though because it was a major deal that her tablet that she took orders on be working right which in the beginning caused a five minute delay.   She then took the drink back to the bar and tried to figure out what &#34;on the rocks&#34; meant from the bar tender... And instead of remaking it he simply poured the shaken drink over ice. For a place that appears to be high end and prices accordingly that was a pretty cheap move on their part (keep in mind the &#34;owner/manager&#34; was within earshot of the entire event).

I could keep going and analyzing every detail of the night that left a bad taste in my mouth about this place but to keep it to the point the place is over priced, service is a joke (along with management) and the food selection is not what a successful bar needs."

She knew a lot about the wine we brought and talked us through the wine list, so next time we are definitely coming in to try one of the Italian wines. 
After the specials were read 3/4 of us decided to order the veal. We asked her to pick out the temperature of the meat and it was perfect. Oh! After much convincing from her we tried the pork belly. NOT TO BE MISSED! Definitely an A+.

We were seated at our table for nearly 10 minutes before our server greeted us.  He took our drink order and our wine arrived 20 minutes later.  He said he&#39;d bring bread with Parmesan cheese.  The bread arrived, but no cheese.  So we had to ask for that.  My salad did not have any dressing, but my husband&#39;s did.  When I mentioned this to our server, he asked &#34;are you sure?&#34; I said yes and then he questioned me again.  The crab cakes were good, but on the small side. 

We both ordered the fish and we were both disappointed. Our meals arrived without the baked potatoes that we ordered.  We had to ask for those. Then when they did arrive, we had to ask for the sour cream and chives.  I asked our server if they were short staffed this evening and he told us that he had been there since 9:30 a.m. and that three of their employees had participated in an iron man competition. I guess that was supposed to justify the poor service.

We watched a couple who was seated near us get up and leave after 10 minutes because the server never came to their table. 

Our water glasses were never refilled until right before we left. After we finished our appetizer, salad and even our entrees, no one came to remove the plates.  We began stacking them on the other side of the table so they would not be in front of us. 

The poor service and below-average meal do not match up to the prices on the menu.  

I hope the owner is able to make some positive changes to this restaurant.  When we left, we saw that Fiora&#39;s across the street was packed while Wildwood was not."

It was my first time coming here, so I scoped out an option for ahi tuna over a strawberry salad for lunch, $16.  I had a server by the name of Michelle who first told me this wasn&#39;t a lunch option.  More than once.  I showed her the menu and subsequently she told me she normally doesn&#39;t work lunch and wasn&#39;t familiar with the menu. (What?)  Anyways, I asked for the tuna rare, I double checked this was indeed an option, which she said yes it was.  The food came out quick, and the tuna was cooked well through, far from rare. When she came out and I showed her this, she blamed the cook and kept saying, I rang it in right and talked to the cook. And now she informed me they grill it.  Which would have been fine, if it wasn&#39;t overcooked. Doesn&#39;t fix my non pink fish lol. 

I am sure that there are other good entrees on the menu, but this one fell far from expectations. I had no expectations of an apology, and I would love to go back, but given there are other options, I doubt my husband and I will be coming here anytime soon."

Wait person came once after order to check on us.  Refills once.
As an aside, I had the Door County Whitefish, and have had a rolling stomach since.  Fish over cooked, little flavor--could only taste shiitake mushrooms.
Overpriced and not worth the trip."

They close their doors for dining on week nights now at 8:30. BUT don&#39;t feel sorry for them! They pass their money troubles on to the Customer by DILUTING their LIQUOR with WATER - and then deny it! Gin on the rocks is hard to
Dilute without a gin drinker noticing.  It&#39;s a father son duo manager and owner and paying Shodeen rent. 
How sad is that ? I finally got a shot straight up just to prove it myself. The manager had to go out to get a NEW bottle to pour the straight up Shot. We closed our check and walked out. We  will NeVER go back. Too many reputable businesses in Geneva to deal with that ripoff and deception. Tarnishing our town. Bye!"

My wife and I walk past it every weekend on our way to Nosh is Geneva, and we always think about going in for brunch. Well today we pulled the trigger and I wish I could take that decision back. We got there at 1045 and were seated immediately; no surprise as there were only 4 tables with guests. We did not have anyone take a drink order until 11. We had two waitresses come by and tell us they would be with us in a few minutes, but a different one ended up taking our order. 
Drinks took about 10 minutes (orange and grapefruit juice) to arrive. We placed our order at this point and then waited 40 freaking minutes for our food to arrive. As we were sitting there I told my wife that I guarantee our food is just sitting in the window, as I had not seen our waitress since we placed the order. Sure enough, the food arrived and it was cold. Not warm....cold. When the waitress came by 20 minutes later she asked how everything was. I said &#34;meh, cold&#34; and then shrugged. Her response was &#34;oh, fantastic&#34;, and then she walked away. 
I had the steak and eggs. Steak was over salted and poached eggs were overcooked. My wife had green eggs and ham. Again, eggs were overcooked. Did I mention everything was cold? You know what does not taste good when they are cold? Poached eggs, potatoes, steak, zucchini, an english muffin, ham, spinach, and hollandaise sauce. Actually, all those things really suck when they are cold. You know what also sucks? Waitresses that don&#39;t care when you tell them your meal was cold and don&#39;t actually listen to your response when they ask you how everything is. 
Next time we walk by this place, we will just keep walking. The best part of the whole meal was the mint as we left the restaurant."

My wife had the Salmon and was disappointed as well, in both size and flavor. I have too many options to spend over $150 at dinner and be this disappointed!"

Our steaks were cooked to the orders we wanted, but they tasted like they were sprayed in vinegar with a sparce amount of other seasonings. Not only was the taste poor, but the meat was more tough than tender. The steak was something I would have expected from a chili&#39;s, not a lush downtown geneva restaurant. 

As far as the rest of the meal goes, the only side that stood out was the freshly baked bread. My potatoe tasted as if it had been baked yesterday and rewarmed for my meal. The ceasar wasnt anything special either. 

I&#39;ll come back when someone else wants to pay for me to eat their over valued food to dine in a nice atmosphere."

I had an 8:15 reservation at Wildwood but after waiting until almost 9:00 and still not getting a table, my wife and I decided to give up and go home. Clearly Wildwood cannot handle the holiday crowd.  The folks at Wildwood need to understand that the idea is for them to wait on us and not for us to wait on them. I give them two stars because the bartender was nice enough and I had a meal there a couple of years ago that was very good.  Too bad I banked on them for a holiday meal. Maybe I can find a good Christmas movie on HBO."

Party of six for New Year&#39;s Eve.  Checked in 15 minutes early and we decided to wait in the bar.  After 40 minutes in the bar I checked back with the hostess and she informed us that they were running behind and although our table was ready they were trying to give the server time to catch up......bad sign.  We were finally seated almost an hour after our original reservation and greatly by a bumbling uncomfortable woman server that proceeded to screw up our orders, not being the basics like bread or then butter and not check in with us enough.

Awkward service is an understatement and it was clear from all of the hostesses, servers, managers and cooks that it was happening to everyone else.  Place felt like it was a mess for each employee all night.

Food was really great though.  If not distracted by the service I would have given this place 5 stars for the food.  Will probably return but on a normal, non-holiday evening."

I chose to come back to the restaurant to take my friend out for his birthday. Unfortunately this experience was not good. At the host desk, after waiting my turn to check in. A person from behind me came around and asked what the wait time was. The hostess stated she could seat her immediately. I let the hostess know that I was still waiting to check in and had a reservation. She took care of the walk in first. The other host came and then took care of us. We were seated at a good table. I put in the reservation that we were there for a birthday celebration and I let the server know immediately that it was my friend&#39;s birthday. This restaurant clearly doesn&#39;t care. No acknowledgement and not even a candle for the cake we ordered for dessert. The service was so long. My reservation was at 7:30. Greeted by the server at 7:40. I asked for a minute to determine my drink order. Server came back at 8:00 to get drink order and appetizer. She left before we could give our dinner order. We got our drinks at 8:20 and appetizer at 8:30. I had to ask the server to take the rest of our order before she left from dropping off the appetizer. She stated that she was going to be right back, but did take the order. Then finally had bread brought to us at 8:40. We received our salads timely after the appetizer at 8:45. We again had a wait for the entry and received that at 9:10. We ordered dessert after dinner and that came out timely after we ordered it. During this time our water was not refilled until we were about to leave at 9:50. The food tasted good. The Medjool dates were excellent. The entrees NY Strip and Rosemary Chicken tasted good but the food temp was cold and the side of green beans almondine was hot. Overall I was not happy with the experience. I have worked in a restaurant and shocked that our dinner was stretched out over 2 1/2 hours. I gave one star due to the food tasting good."

We were here for brunch and the best way to describe it is short handed. We sat outside on the patio and there was 2 servers for 12+ tables. The servers seemed to be doing their best but it seemed an impossible task. The patrons seemed to be laid back and patient but there just wasn&#39;t enough workers. At one point the waiter apologized to the next table for being unable to give them water based on the lack of clean glasses. Once the food arrived, the quiche seemed to be under the heat lamp for the whole morning as I couldn&#39;t even get through it with a fork and a knife.

They used to have the best dinners and drinks, and while the drinks are still poured well, the dinners are lacking. You can tell there has been a change in head cooks. 
If you&#39;re going there, get the prime rib. It&#39;s the only thing I can recommend these days. The filet has gone downhill and the walleye is tasteless. 
Sad, because this is a really great location and used to be the place we went for celebrations. I&#39;m not paying that kind of money for the food they serve now though. What a waste. 
One bright spot - Rachel, the server. She works her tail off out there. I&#39;d hate to think she isn&#39;t getting the tips she deserves because the owner is being skimpy with quality and hiring a decent cook. :(
Finally, it is SUPER LOUD in there. Conversations cannot be had unless there is yelling."

Our service was good, but I feel that this restaurant shouldn&#39;t advertise itself as a steakhouse.  My NY strip was subpar - very gristly and thin.

The service was not attentive at all.  We had to hunt down our waiter for water refills and forget about getting another round of mimosa&#39;s.  You would think they were growing the oranges in the back for the juice to get them over to our table.  The brunch options were tasteless and only the made-to-order omelet was worth eating.  The prime rib was flavorless and cold, the ham was dried out and the buffet options were limited considering the cost per person!  

On the dessert table, the cheese cake was warm and completely mushy.  Their homemade truffles tasted as they had freezer burn and the remaining desserts as my wife says, are are not worth putting on one&#39;s bum since flavor and freshness were lacking big time.  

Overall very disappointing and a shame as last year&#39;s Mother&#39;s Day brunch was very good.  I did notice some reviews saying the place seems not as full with customer and yesterday I was so surprised on how many empty tables there were.  Maybe it&#39;s a sign of decline and the customers have caught-on on that the quality and service management isn&#39;t there anymore.  

I know I will not be revisiting them again and echoing what&#39;s been said here as well, there are far more better places in Geneva that want to earn my business.  Not recommended!"

Don&#39;t expect a meaningful dinner. We were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary. My husband surprised me by making reservations and having a beautiful flower arrangement delivered to Wildwood for our table. When we arrived, we were taken to a very nice table and the flowers were on the table but they were still in the box as they had been delivered ... what would it have taken to remove them from the box and set on the table! We then sat there for at least 30 minutes with no one welcoming us or asking if we would like to order a drink, appetizer, meal, etc.  My husband finally flagged down a server nearby and she apologized and said she would send our server over as soon as possible. We probably sat there for another 15 min., when our server finally came over and informed us that we would have to wait because she was too busy. She later informed us that she would not be able to wait on us at all. Really????  The original server that we had flagged down returned to see if we had been waited on yet. When we told her what happened, she was kind enough to wait on our table, but of course she had her own tables to wait on. She was very courteous and helpful and the food was good, but not our typical experience at Wildwood, which we had frequented several times a year. Towards the end of our dinner, the manager made his way around the tables making polite conversation with the diners. He even avoided us ... we had personally talked to him many times before, as he knew some very good friends of ours who frequented Wildwood at least once a week. We have not been back since!

My date and I sat in the lounge each time and enjoyed a bottle of wine and/or cocktails. 

I&#39;ve never dined there, because, I&#39;ve had three employees (two servers and 1 sous chef) tell me that that get their steaks from Gordon Food Service, and I&#39;m not paying $50 for a GFS steak. That aside, I was still interested in their wine list.  

The bartender was friendly, but was awkward opening bottles and when I ordered one of their signature cocktails, she had to pull out the recipe book.  Ok.  Fine. Still not upset. Still just a little comical.  

The first two visits were fine.  The third week we went, we arrived just before 9:00 on a Tuesday and, like before, we just wanted some wine and we would be gone promptly.  We ordered a bottle and the bartender said the manager would get it in just a moment.  Then, while we were waiting she told us that it was getting late (9:00, they are still open) and she communicated she won&#39;t be serving anyone else for the next 30-40 min until closing. Bit of miscommunication, at best, because then the manager shows up with our bottle and they are debating whether or not they should sell us the wine. She says no. He said yes. And now I&#39;m ticked. I&#39;m sitting right there. I can hear them. 

I said we would wouldn&#39;t waste their time and be out and now I have a bartender who clearly doesn&#39;t want to be bothered with us. This is my issue. And the manager had no spine whatsoever. He had an empty dining room at 8:45 on a Tuesday and he&#39;s ok with letting his bartender be lazy and run her mouth the one of the only bar guests in the lounge? Not smart. 

So, there is not a thing they could offer me to come back. Ever. I got the usual corporate apologetic phrases, but they really are meaningless. Please...don&#39;t waste my time. There really are other places in the Geneva/STC area with fun wine lists that actually welcome your business. I&#39;m going there."

If you&#39;re looking for new suburban steak house options you may want to think twice about Wildwood.

Usually if we&#39;re in the mood for a steakhouse night, we&#39;d pick Ruths Chris, Capital Grille, Gibsons, Sullivans, etc. but we were going to be in Geneva so we thought Wildwood would fit our needs.  

Upon arriving, a red flag went up immediately as there was maybe four or five tables occupied in the main dining room.  It was only 6PM on a Friday and I know it&#39;d pick up later, but you could have shot a cannon through there...and by the time we left, it was maybe half full.  Our server was nice and prompt, but not very polished for a place this $$$$.  The bar was hoppin&#39; though!

I will spare going through course by course, and cut to the chase - the food did not match the prices.  Period.  This, in my opinion seems like a faux &#34;steakhouse&#34; that happens to have steak on the menu.  And the steak?  Ribeyes and filets were simply grilled with zero seasoning...and a jus poured over the top that was strangely gelatinous.  I&#39;m not a picky dude and NEVER send food back, but I seriously contemplated it.  Almost reminded me of wedding reception steak.  Escargot was decent, chorizo dates a waste of time.  Didn&#39;t stay for dessert.  I got the bill and just shook my head at what we received for a huge tally.  

This isn&#39;t just an angry bitch session, but I am just more amazed in the lack of quality for a huge price tag.  I do hope they turn it around, because it has tons of potential.  Robert Irvine or Gordon Ramsay  would have a field day. ; )

Just one mans opinion!"

He was friendly enough but a little absent minded.  Asked for an ice coffee and he never brought it out. We asked for beer and discussed the options in depth and we had to flag him down to bring it , and he had forgotten that we asked for a draft.

I wanted to try a new restaurant in downtown Geneva with my wife and ended up here.  What I got was the worst food and service I have had in a long time. First the waiter, per the receipt was Bob, has a smug arrogance to him when we would ask any questions regarding the menu and wine list.   First we got bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo.  They came out cold and were bathed in a BBQ sauce that tasted like it came from Aldi.  Next there were salads. My caesar salad lacked any flavor whatsoever (even the croutons were shitty) and my wife&#39;s wedge salad has a total of two tomatoes on it. My dinner was Prime Rib.  Ordered it medium and it came out completely cooked through with a grey color to it.  It tasted like it has been warmed up, cooled off everyday for the last week.  Absolutely disgusting.  Needless to say my wife&#39;s fish was terrible as well.  

I will NEVER go back.  There are a lot of great places in Geneva, but Wildwood is TERRIBLE stay away."

The barely melted top gave away the microwaving reheat and the entree should have been named a cheese/bacon pie. 
Very disappointed with the replacement of crab cakes too. Sorry but the quality of the food isn&#39;t what I have had here in the past. Too $$$ for the quality. Service was fine."

Let&#39;s start with an overly friendly waitress UNTIL we had requests.  Every little thing we asked for was no we can&#39;t do that, no can&#39;t do it, no, no, no.  Could you ask the benevolent chef if I can have cheese mixed into my eggs...no just blobbed on top, John asked for sausage instead of ham in his omelet...no our sausage doesn&#39;t crumble...could &#34;chef&#34; cut it up...no, Jacob wanted soup no soup until dinner (soup nazi comes to mind) I would like the hamburger of the month...no just for lunch...noting it was lunch time...no, no, no!!!

You can have nothing your way only the way of the great imposing oz or &#34;chef&#34;.  

Once we made it known we were not happy the waitron disappeared no more refills for you, no more how is everything, no!  We left her a poor tip but not as poor as I wanted to leave.

I spoke with what passes for management.  I listed our complaints, his response...our sausage doesn&#39;t crumble..oh and thanks for telling me...the look and attitude said I don&#39;t give a * what you think.

We waited well over 20 minutes to get our bill and another 15 minutes for her to find her way back to the table to process the cards.

POOR on every level!!  I guess this is what passes for upscale in Geneva."

Our server, Rachel, was very personable and on-point with her menu recommendations. She helped us decide on a great Pinot Nior for a reasonable price, and she was happy to explain various entrees to us when we were deciding what to order. We ended up trying the scallops, steak tare tare, Chilean sea bass, and salmon. All of the dishes were amazing and full of flavor, but my favorites were the scallops and  the salmon. The only slight critique I have about the outdoors was the fact that I got a ton of mosquito bites. I think there were small fire pits closer to the middle of the patio, but perhaps they should add torches along the edges to repel bugs. All in all though, we had an excellent meal and enjoyed the friendly customer service. We will definitely be back."

The place was packed and I don&#39;t just mean by numbers.  The tables were so close I felt like I owed the diners an apology for simply walking past their tables in order to be seated.  We sat for roughly 8 minutes before we were approached.  No waters, no contacts.  Our server flew past us and let us know he would be with us shortly...(a relative term...)  Another long stretch of time and he came for drink orders.  The remainder of the evening was more of the same.  Our server was just too busy to provide, even, mediocre service.  It was fairly pricey and I would have had a much better review had the service not been so putrid.  The food was very good and the presentation was lovely.  I guess I would have preferred some happy meeting in the middle.
Lastly, LOUD.  Do I sound like I&#39;m a hundred years old?  I&#39;m not.  I love vibrant, lively places.  Tonight, I felt like an ASL interpreter would have been an asset.  Fairly obnoxious due to the level of noise."

The service was okay, at best, perhaps he was new, but he seemed almost scared or unsure of himself and didn&#39;t really know how to even explain or describe some of the dishes. I got a pot roast special that he described as &#34;kind of like an enchilada but with a noodle instead of the shell with pot roast inside.&#34; Now, it&#39;s not his fault that it wasn&#39;t that good (it was LOADED with mushrooms to the point that you couldn&#39;t even taste the meat) but I don&#39;t remember them even being in the description! I also had steak tartar for an appetizer... save your money, it&#39;s like the tuna salad you spread on crackers with relish but with beef instead of tuna. My husband and father-in-law weren&#39;t super impressed with their meals either, and it wasn&#39;t busy at all on a Friday night! I think it was a sign. We probably won&#39;t go back until some changes are made... like, hopefully, a new chef."

The Tomato Shrimp Bisque was good to start but then I had a prime rib that was done properly and presented well but had very little flavor. 
My date had Pot Roast &amp; Mushroom Rollatini. I will admit this isn&#39;t something I would normally order but I tried it. The first thing I asked her was &#34;is this what it is supposed to taste like?&#34; (I tried it before she did) It was awful! This is something she would normally order and she apologized and said she should have tried it first because she didn&#39;t even think it tasted right.

We then went to the bar area which had a nice atmosphere. They had a 2 piece couple doing live music and they were pretty good. On the other hand the room is not the large and no means was that busy. Taking that into account and the type of restaurant I thought the music was very loud. This is coming fro someone who still has a tendency to turn the car radio up. 

The service on the restaurant side was great but the bartender forgot our drinks and we were setting at the bar.

We started with general appetizers and the chicken satay was dry, even with the dipping sauce.  When we got to the main meal, I had a Filet Mignon and I must say it was very disappointing.  It looked great and was cooked properly but the taste was extremely bland.  It barely tasted like a typical filet.  Also, the baked potato tasted like it was sitting in a warmer too long and was not really fluffy (Not sure how to describe).

I&#39;ve eaten here once before and remember being underwhelmed that time as well but never posted a review.  This latest visit confirmed the earlier one.  There are better steak places in Geneva and the Tri-Cities that I would suggest before Wildwood."

We started out early on a Sunday, well, early for dinner so we just relaxed with friends on the patio and drank some delicious Prisoner wine.  It was extremely pleasant, the wine shop next door had some live music on their patio, so we enjoyed that too!  At 5, the kitchen opened so we decided to order another bottle of wine and have some dinner.  I ordered the Caesar salad and the Seafood Risotto.  I would definitely go back for the risotto, it was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  Others at the table ordered the steak, the salmon and the starter scallops.  The scallops in the risotto were far superior to the starter.  The steak and salmon were good according to the eaters... Everyone at the table enjoyed their dinner.  It isn&#39;t a cheap night but if you&#39;ve got a little green to blow, I&#39;d recommend this place, the price is the hesitation between 3 and 4 stars."

Mainly because I don&#39;t feel the need too often to review. But I felt the urge to about Wildwood based on the cost and the food not matching up. This was my first time at Wildwood, my husband and I got a gift card this past Christmas for $50 so we thought we would give it a go! The reviews are very mixed so I was skeptical but being we had the gift card and it needed to be used we choose to go on our once a month (if that) date night. The decor and ambiance of this place is really pretty. The outside seating was really nice because we just love hanging out outside whenever possible. I would say looking and feel....yes this would be a $$$ restaurant. The only problem is, the food =/ This is why I HAD to make a review. My opinion is that if you are wanting to go out for a nice dinner knowing you will spend over $100 dollars easily for two people then sadly, this is NOT your place. We ordered the fondue appetizer and that was pretty tasty. It was basically bread dug out, filled with cheese and seafood that you dipped crouton like squares into. It was good, I will admit we enjoyed that. However, our main dishes were less then satisfying. My husband ordered a chicken stuffed dish and the chicken was pretty dry. This upset me even more because if you look through other reviews others have complained about the same thing! How can a restaurant do this on a regular basis and charge what it does for their meals??? I ordered the Fillet Mignon and was very very disappointed! If I am paying $40 plus just for a steak I want my knife to slide through it. I don&#39;t want to cut through it like I do a steak I just bought from the grocery store down the street. Not only that, they have chosen to put the steak over a gravy type thing and my $50 dollar meal tasted like pot roast right out of the crock pot =/ I could not believe it! Homeade pot roast for $50?. This is a three money signs restaurant with a two dollar money sign quality at most! I have honestly had better steak at Applebees. I just get really upset with places like this. Just because you dress up your place to look the part, you have to back it up with proof that my money is being well spent and Wildwood you sorely disappointed us. 
 
Our total bill with tip was about $130 with tip. Of course we were lucky enough to have the $50 gift card but I would have to say this meal wasn&#39;t even worth the $80 of our own money. 

*One more thing I forgot to mention. Two tables over a couple came with there kid who was probably about twelve. They called the waitress over and we hear the child say very sweetly,&#34; Um, the chicken is really hard.&#34; The waitress obviously disappointed took a knife and said,&#34; Really?&#34; as she reached over and tried to cut it. As a parent this actually offends me because it was as if she didn&#39;t believe him. But it was true, she could not cut through the kids chicken nugget dish. Eww*"

On a good note the Tomahawk Chop was outstanding and the service was great, but the kitchen did have an off night.  The cold sides, raw onion rings and cold Dover sole out shined the great parts.

We dined early and were among the first to be seated.  Rachel was our server and did a wonderful job throughout.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list.  We all ordered a fish dish, two from their special lenten menu.  We mixed it up, asking that one of the dished be prepared other than their suggested way.  There was no issue in doing that and while we didn&#39;t ask for lots of changes, they appeared to be very flexible.  Rachel told us about the wine special and when there was hesitation she offered or a taste.  A pleasant Chardonnay which one of our party ordered and enjoyed.  The fish was wonderful, the swordfish was done through, which is my preference, but
was not overdone.  Just right.  The other fish was equally well done.  We had a lovely dinner.  Everyone was friendly .  We entered through the bar which is definitely a 
&#34;happening&#34; place.  Maybe another time.  We will definitely return the next time we are in the area.

The clock was ticking, the shops were bustling and after losing serious track of time my shopping cohort and I fell into Wildwood not even glancing at their hours. The hostess looked at the clock and told us that the doors were closing in T minus 1 minute and we could squeeze ourselves in for brunch. Note to you, for Sunday Brunch, the hours are cut a little short so beware of when to stop by.

The dining room is massive and can hold small to large groups. A gargantuan fireplace chunks out the space and provides an invitingly warm, dim and relaxing setting. We were seated toward the back of the room but were able to see the open kitchen area and the chefs hard at work.

Upon being seated, we were greeted with a fresh bowl of fruit and a sort of blintz (? some kind of fried dough). The fruit I assume is seasonal, can&#39;t speak for the dough as I like to avoid those kind of treats but it was a nice touch. For brunch, my eating/shopping cohort ordered the Grand Marnier French Toast I ordered the Chicken Salad Croissant sandwich.

The real winner was the scent of the maple syrup for the toast. As it rested on the tabletop, it thickened up. The chicken salad was a standard, easy prep sandwich served with shoestring fries. 

The prices for brunch are reasonable, the service was on par despite us being one of the last diners in the room who also skid into the last minute brunch. I&#39;d like to see how the restaurant is during an evening and try another sampling.

A big bonus, if you&#39;re a culinary fanatic, cooking classes hosted by the head chef ($50 per course) are offered in addition to the menu. Class schedules are at the front door by the hostess&#39; station."

But our most recent visit was on Christmas Eve and just an amazing night.  There were 3 specials and our table had two of them, the Beef Wellington (with a mushroom duxelle) and the Lobster Thermidor.  MK had the large cut Prime Rib and was raving about it and I had the Tomahawk Chop (Ribeye with the bone).  Aidan was lucky enough to have a cheese burger (which he loved)

Every time I eat there (granted it is usually a weekday) we are the only ones in the dining room. It is a nice restaurant. But the food is SO average and WAY WAY overpriced its just ridiculous. $65-85 dollars for lobster tail. Whoever is running this restaurant doesn&#39;t have a clue.

I knew I was in store for another great meal as soon as the hostess, Alex greeted us as we walked in. She seemed genuinely glad that we were there and made sure we were seated at a table that met our needs. Our server came to the table within a few minutes and told us about the specials and offered us a wine menu. The wine selection is outstanding and is priced accordingly....expensive, but not overly so for a restaurant of this caliber.

I ordered the Salmon in Parchment and my companion ordered the Rib Eye steak. Both were served to perfection. In my opinion Wildwood serves the BEST steaks in all of the western suburbs.

The waiter was arrogant and rude. One women was served tilapia with a sauce she did not ask for and his answer was lady this is how it is served. Well she is allergic to what was in the sauce, the hostess took it back and got her some without the sauce. He never came back to the table to ask if anyone wanted dessert or coffee. The bus people grabbed the plates as each diner finished regardless of who was left eating - isn&#39;t that waitering 101? Clear the table when the table is done. The bill came with an 18% gratuity when they asked about it he said this is the way its done. One woman said well that explains why the service was so bad. You can bet this group will not be back and I will not even bother."

The food took forever to come out and it was simultaneously overcooked and cold. One of the dishes was completely wrong, and when we told our server this she did not apologize but instead stood at the table for 20 seconds looking at what she had written down (hint: you take it away immediately and resolve the problem). 

Once she brought the correct entree, she said the kitchen screwed up. The owner came over ten seconds after she left and apologized, saying the server put the wrong order in. After the owner left we discovered that this dish was also cold, but could not flag down the server for another ten minutes. We were finally able to tell her that while the dish was edible, we would prefer that it would be heated up. 

The server left for another ten minutes (we assumed she would perhaps bring out another dish), when she came back without a dish we complained about the temperature again and she said &#34;well you said it was edible, I thought you were going to eat it.&#34; We told her to heat it up, and the manager came over. After relating him our grievances, he said &#34;well it&#39;s Christmas Eve, so it&#39;s all hands on deck. Please come back and try us out again.&#34; (note: this is not an acceptable explanation, if you cannot handle the traffic, you reduce the amount of tables you book). 

The correct dish finally arrived at the correct temperature but of course the rest of the party was finished with their respective meals. When it took an inordinate amount of time to get the check we assumed the manager was going to do the right thing and comp some or all of the meal. Alas, this was not the case and we against our better judgment paid the bill in full with a commensurately modest tip. 

The restaurant itself is strangely designed - entering on Third Street places you in a bar area and you have to cut cross the entire dining area to reach the hostess station. The decor is tasteful if bland - you would expect a tad more sophistication if you are dropping at least $50 a head, but this would hardly be a sticking point if the food and service would&#39;ve been on point. The menu is standard American, nothing interesting or particularly enticing. 

In conclusion, all we were offered was contradictory excuses for poor execution at an exorbitant price on what was supposed to be a special night for my family. No one resolved the issues in any satisfactorily manner. I suggest you dine elsewhere if you have the option."

I took a date here for Valentine&#39;s Day 2010. We were seated promptly in a medium-sized wood- and brick- decorated dining room. Our waiter David H. seemed extremely knowledgeable about both the food and drink menus. I settled on a medium-rare 16-oz prime rib with horseradish butter, a side of parmesan au gratin potatoes, and a bottle of Chimay Bleue. My date went for a medium 6-oz fillet mignon with the same side and a raspberry cocktail. In both cases the meat was unbelievably tender and moist, and we both loved the potatoes. For dessert we split a crème brulée made by their in-house pastry chef. While it&#39;s certainly more than I would usually spend for dinner, the bill of around $100 plus tip for the entire affair was well worth it."

Food was pretty good but a bit pricey for the quality. Prime rib was good, I&#39;ve had better and I&#39;ve had worse. Presentation was lacking. They must reheat the prime rib before serving as it looked at bit gray on arrival which had me concerned since I ordered med-rare. Once I started cutting I could see the inside was med-rare. Wish it was warmer though. Sides were good, Caesar salad was ho-hum, desserts were ok.

(1) Steak Frittes 8oz top sirloin - Medium Well - Meat was tender and was seasoned well. Good
(1) Chicken Salad Crossant -It was more bread and salad than Chicken... They should rename it on the menu to &#34;Croissant Salad with a hint of Chicken&#34;
(4) Glass of Water 0.00 cost

Total Cost for this meal plus 15% Gratuity $55.00

Maybe on the next attempt we will go for the Oak Grilled steak and the Pacific Rim Swordfish (mmmm sounds greasy!)

The Short:  Service wasn&#39;t good.  Food was just alright.  The place looks cool.

The Long:  My major complaint about this place is that there were like 20 servers (or what appeared to be servers) running around trying to get stuff done and ours didn&#39;t seem to care much about our experience.

Our server did the minimum she needed to do... took our order and brought us our food.  Beyond that we never saw her because she was too busy folding silverware in napkins.  She never asked us how we were doing.  She never asked if we wanted drink refills.

In fact, I walked up to the bar to get my own refills.  Cause it sucks to eat food that is a little spicy without anything to wash it down.

We started off with the pretzels.  Which, they give a ton of pretzels.  And, was totally worth the $9 we spent on them.  The cheese sauce wasn&#39;t bad... but didn&#39;t really stand out, in my opinion.

I got the Mac and Cheese with Chili.  It was weird, because when I ordered that I pictured something totally different than what I got.  I imagined the chili to have a lot of meat.  There was not much meat at all. There was like a tablespoon of meat, tons of beans and a fair amount of tomatoes. The portion size seemed fair.

My wife got the Cuban Panini and said it was pretty good, but the fries had no flavor at all.

I really was in the mood to try someplace new.  I wanted to enjoy my experience.  I know sometimes people go into a situation not being 100% into the idea.  I was and am a little upset that a server and mediocre food ruined it for me.  I hope to go back and see if it was just an off night."

We waited in the front and were offered beer samples, a grapefruit ale that was just delicious.

We were seated after about 15 minutes and were brought to a high pub table. The table was fine, but the chairs don&#39;t appear to be built for anyone with junk in the trunk. Seriously if you have even a slightly not flat butt, you will feel like you are falling out of this chair. 

Our waitress was friendly and professional. I can&#39;t remember her name, but she was great. She seemed to be rushing around and brought our drinks out not all at the same time. My iced tea first, then their lemonade and beers. I would&#39;ve thought they would come out at once, or at least the nonalcoholic options first then the beer. Whatever. So domestic drafts and their house ales are on special for $3 on Saturdays which is a really nice special.

Other Saturday specials include $3 Absolut mixers, $4 jaeger shots, $5 jaeger bombs, $5 individual pizza, $6.99 for customize your own burger. Which is exactly what we all ended up doing. I had a chicken sandwich with pepper jack, avocado, bacon, tomato and chipotle mayo. All those toppings were included. Up to 5 toppings, even off their &#34;premium list&#34;. They had a lot of great specials for the entire week. My sandwich was delicious and my husband swears that his chicken sandwich was the best he has ever had. My friend ordered the veggie burger. Neither the waitress nor the general manager knew what brand of veggie burgers they were. Frozen, boxed burgers. That&#39;s really all you need to know. So basically, a morningstar chipotle black bean burger, which is what everyone has. My friend seemed to enjoy it, nonetheless.

My only complaint was that it was very, very loud inside. So loud that we could not hear each other while talking at the table. Between the TVs, music and everyone talking we had to shout to hear each other. I could barely hear the person next to me without shouting and I definitely could not hear my husband across the table without leaning and shouting. Not great for conversation at all. Otherwise, great place. We will return."

Hubby ordered the Thursday special of chicken tenders with a side of fries. HIs response when I asked how his food was, &#34;It&#39;s okay&#34;.  Hmmmm...  I ordered the &#34;Housemade&#34; Pretzels for $10.00 and what I got were the same SuperPretzels that I bought at Walmart!  Six microwaved pretzels with 3 dips (they had the exact same marks on the bottom as the ones in my freezer).  Our receipt listed the pretzels as &#34;Warm pretzels&#34; yep, warmed in the microwave!!!  That, topped off by the completely lackluster service by our server Kelsey, pretty much solidifies that we won&#39;t be back.  Not our first time here, but will be out last.  Oh yeah and of the SIX people standing at the host station, not a one of them acknowledged us as we were leaving. I do want to say that the food runner and the bus staff were on point and attentive, unfortunately, our server was not at all!!!  If you&#39;re looking for a bar to hang out at with your friends, then you&#39;ve found your place.  But, if you want a good meal with good service, head elsewhere."

The environment: Yes, it&#39;s very loud. It&#39;s the style of a typical sports bar, crowded, loud, lots of TVs, etc. Kind of difficult to have a conversation, seems like a better place to meet for drinks than for dinner.

The service: sllloooowwww. I genuinely felt bad for the bartender, she was so busy, people constantly grabbing her attention, she never had a minute to stop. But because of it, many of the bar customers weren&#39;t getting the attention we were all waiting for. Another girl and 2 guys were in and out of the bar area trying to help but it seemed unorganized and not like a team-effort.

The food: just okay. We each had bacon burgers. They were neither juicy nor flavorful. They were extremely messy. We both ordered them &#34;medium&#34; and one was overcooked. Had parmesan garlic wings to start -- flavor was good, wings were soft not crispy (people have different preferences, I prefer crispy).

FYI: They have coupons online. Good ones! We printed them and were intending to use them but it took sooooooo long to get our check we completely forgot to use them because we were so focused on tracking down someone, anyone, to get our check and help us pay so we could leave. It just took too long.

They do have really great specials each day, including dollar burgers, half price pizzas, and drink specials. Maybe that&#39;s why they&#39;re so busy?"

Ordered the appetizer platter. It was average. Essentially frozen items that had been cooked. Daughter commented that the mozzarella sticks were &#34;typical&#34;. Pretzels were like the ones you can buy in the frozen food section of any large grocer - although cheese sauce was good. Husband said wings were good. All in all - typical bar food.

Husband ordered the burger and commented it had a nice grilled flavor. Good that it was a Saturday special . When we asked about fries, we were informed they were frozen so ordered the homemade coleslaw instead - which was ok.

Daughters fried mac and cheese was clearly another item that was frozen and then cooked there. 

My caprese flatbread was ok - edges were crisp and inside was softer. It was ok. 

Bulldog wheat beer was good - had a citrus undertone and 5$ chocolate martini was enjoyable. 

Finished the night with baked chocolate chip cookie which was sweet - as dessert should be. 

All in all - it&#39;s typical bar food. Not a gastro pub but edible ( as long as you enjoy items purchased frozen).

Decor is nice . Place is clean. Server was attentive and nice.  It is noisy. 

Good place to watch a game with a large group.  Not a place for upscale pub fare.  It&#39;s a solidly average &#34;joint&#34; and every town needs one of those."

There are so few restaurants in this densely populated area they have a full restaurant. The food seems pre/packaged. Low quality and grease and salt are the secret ingredients. 

The noise level  prohibits any conversation. The food is prepared in a deep fryer or microwave oven. The waitress thinks it&#39;s timely to serve the appetizer the same time the meal is served.  

Otherwise it&#39;s a great place. I think the building has bad karma. This is 5th place in three years...  I&#39;d suggest a fast food joint over this place."

Jocelyn and the rest of the wait staff were very friendly, fast and accommodating. For beer lovers, the selection is huge, so you definitely won&#39;t go thirsty. I tried the Bulldog Sunset Wheat. It was fruity and light. A 32 oz. mug was only $4.00! My only gripe is that it could have been served a little colder.

We started with the soft pretzel and queso appetizer. The pretzels were a warm salty delight and the queso was spicy, but not too spicy for kids. Three of us had burgers and one had the Reuben. We were all pleased with our choices. All burgers were served on a pretzel bun, which was a perfect complement to the juicy, meaty burgers. I ordered mine medium well, but I think I&#39;ll go medium next time, since mine seemed slightly over cooked. My Ale House burger was supposed to include onion straws, but I was served raw onions instead. No complaints here, as I love raw onions.

My only other criticism is that the A/C needed to be cranked up. The temps outside were around 80 and it was just slightly cooler in the restaurant.

We will most definitely be back. Welcome to the neighborhood!"

The poppers were so delicious and you can tell they were homemade and not frozen.

The only thing I was disappointed with was my main course. They have Mac and cheese bites, Mac and cheese burger and regular Mac and cheese! So I went with the mac and cheese, thinking it would be maybe homemade with real cheese baked with breadcrumbs. I was severely disappointed.

Server was fine, although she snapped at me when I requested no ranch on my burger twice. She said she heard me already. U do not say that to customers. She was courteous otherwise.  The lighting is way too dark. I could not read my menu.  The boneless wings were salty, and my burger which had jalapenos and tortilla strips was average. The fries were HORRIBLE! There was a so much salt on them, I couldn&#39;t eat more than 5 pieces. I enjoy fries with my burger, so I was very disappointed. I guess this is how they always season their fries. Anyway, I cannot recommend this place and will not go back."

A little too dimly lit for my tastes, it lighting made it a little difficult to read the menus. 
We had dinner on a Saturday evening, we were estimated a 30 minute wait, we were waiting no more than 10-15 minutes. 6.99 build your own burger Saturdays.
As a vegetarian food selection is often limited and often has to be custom ordered. I ordered a burger with the veggie patty. This burger was honestly the BEST veggie burger I have ever eaten. The fries have a fantastic seasoning. Mixed drinks from the bar were pretty terrible. Though if dining at an Ale House one should choose the beer.
Overall a fantastic dining experience and we will certainly be regulars. Signing up for emails on their website have yielded coupons for free appetizers and entrees.
I highly recommend Bulldogs Ale House."

However, we won&#39;t be going back if we are hungry. We were disgusted in their stated practice of nickel and diming customers to make a buck. 

The customer next to us ordered 10 spicy chicken wings. He said they were good but when he asked for another tiny cup of the watered down blue cheese he was told it would cost a quarter. A quarter for blue cheese when you order chicken wings? They should either give you a bigger than tiny plastic cup or just give you extra when you want it. Oh yeah, celery was also another quarter after the one piece that came on the plate. That is inexcusable.

My wife ordered the grilled four-cheese sandwich. It was so dry that she asked for some mayo to moisten it up with. That also cost a quarter for, again, a tiny little plastic cup of mayo? Sorry but you are not going to go broke giving mayo to your customers for free. You buy it by the gallon for maybe $10. That is the cost of doing business not the cost you pass on to your customers. 

Now, if you are interested in just drinking, they do have a lot of taps (I think she said 36 or 40) of different beer. But, since I don&#39;t drink I cannot see going back unless they change their policies."

The other reviews are correct. The service is atrocious here. 

Last time I went was about a month ago for a going away party for my coworkers. There were about 18 to 20 of us and we were the only people in the bar because it was a weird time of day. We had a server who was blonde, had a man bun, muscles and a lil scruff. I was actually excited to get a male server because every single female server I had here was horrible. 

He comes and takes our orders and 6 of us towards the end of the table wanted beers. We ordered beers and he left the table. He comes back 15 minutes later and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. We told him that we ordered beer. He said oh yeah and laughed.  15 minutes later he came back empty handed to our side of the table and asked us if we were ordering food. We said maybe but where are the beers? He laughed again.  

I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say it took me over 30 minutes to get a beer.  And we were sitting 10 feet from the bar! I wanted to jump over and pour it myself. 

Needless to say only a quarter of the 20 person table left him a tip because that&#39;s how much it sucked.  I asked my coworkers how their experience was down at the other end and they said it was the same as mine. 

You would think the managers of Bulldogs would get it together and hire competent servers especially when there are so many complains about service. The servers may be attractive but they don&#39;t have much going on upstairs. I&#39;d rather have a guy who looked like King Kong serve me if he could actually get me a beer when I order it."

The service was repulsive. , This person with all the 3 rd grade tats was either high or on something ! the manager could careless that we had huge issues at our table !  the food was good ...I almost couldn&#39;t contain myself that this place is crowed! Sad for North Aurora, they get a new resturant and the staff was such a horrible turn off!  We won&#39;t be going back,let&#39;s see how many of these clueless waitresses/ bartender can Make  a living on NO TIPS! Go back up north on Randall better service and more class"

Somehow all of the premium beers they have on tap are always out of stock. They only staff a minimal amount of people behind the bar so this means you have to wait a long time to get your 3rd choice of beer but I won&#39;t blame the wait staff for this inconvenience. As for the food? Stick with the wings or a burger they really should not make anything else.  My biggest gripe is that they are almost always out of the better beers.

When I saw that there was another one opening near my home I was interested in giving the chain another shot and I was glad I did. After looking at the yelp reviews prior to going I was nervous that it was going to be similar to the service I received up north a bit, but I will happily say it was the opposite. We sat down with 10 minutes (which was fantastic because they said it was going to be a 30 minute wait). Our waitress, Hani, was fantastic. She was very attentive and unbelievably kind. Even though the restaurant was very crowded and busy she was polite and checked in on us often. My boyfriend and I are def. coming back for a second visit. Thanks Hani for the amazing service!"

-Agree with the other reviewers.  Boost the number of wait staff.  They seem to want to make a difference, but are limited.
-Burgers are good, fries are just ok.  Wouldn&#39;t take too much to make them special.  Go for it!
-Beverage selections.  More options, if possible.  Please brew your own tea! 
-Coupons are really great - do keep them coming.
We don&#39;t have a lot of restaurants to choose from in this area so I am looking forward to visiting Bulldog Ale House in the future, providing they knock out some of the new restaurant kinks.
Good luck!"

They were giving away free mini beers for all the people waiting in the foyer so that was nice.  They send you a text when your table is ready I ended up getting a text at 7:15.  So that wait was over an hour.  It also was the second Friday in Lent, so I think the fish fry brought people out.  We&#39;ll definitely be back just not when it&#39;s during their busiest times."

-Agree with the other reviewers.  Boost the number of wait staff.  They seem to want to make a difference, but are limited.
-Burgers are good, fries are just ok.  Wouldn&#39;t take too much to make them special.  Go for it!
-Beverage selections.  More options, if possible.  Please brew your own tea! 
-Coupons are really great - do keep them coming.
We don&#39;t have a lot of restaurants to choose from in this area so I am looking forward to visiting Bulldog Ale House in the future, providing they knock out some of the new restaurant kinks.
Good luck!"

The bartenders make you feel like your bothering them. I tried to get ones attention by waving my arms but she looked at me and continued to talk to the other bartender. Food and beer where great. Service sucked. They are new I will give it a month or two then give it one more try.

The service, management, training, food quality on beer/food along with a management crew that has no sense of urgency made for a very disappointing first visit. There are some inexpensive beer &amp; drink specials that might lure me in there again. However heres an example of what went wrong with the Bloody Mary special: $5 Bloody Mary specials on Subday...great, but the cheese &amp; pepperoni spear tasted like it was prepped a day before &amp; just had a stale taste that didn&#39;t go well with what could have been a good Blood Mary &amp; all the other fixins&#39;. Like other people on Yelp, I had to go to the bar to get a beer &amp; gave up after the bartender seemed too busy with side chatter &amp; 6 low maintenance beer drinkers. Next came the service at the table, attentive on the wrong things, inexperienced hadn&#39;t tried much of the items to tell us about the food. Ordered some flatbread. It was flat, floppy, kinda gross. I&#39;d never order it again. Got the wings. They were more like sad fowl nuggets &amp; tasted old &amp; frozen like a freezer that hasn&#39;t been cleaned out in a while. I noticed one male manager sitting off to the side ALOT when clearly the bartender needed help, the server needed help answering questions and well...there was plenty of idle servers doing not much of anything. The burger my family member got looked promising. He also mentioned none of the food was really great just ok from other visits. Lastly we went through an awkward transition to close the tab when our server got cut for the night. One of the managers took over who basically made it no mystery the other manager who was sitting around wanted to close out his ticket in the system so he could leave and get his tip. I understand wanting to get your tips &amp; leave but overall, it was a very unprofessional exchange &amp; I kinda felt like somebody turned over a Ferrari to a bunch of kids. Overall, you could turn this bar into a dive bar with just the beer on tap &amp; a few burgers on the menu, but there&#39;s nothing special going on here. I thought about going back, but I won&#39;t. I&#39;m thinking there&#39;s probably some questionable things going on with the food &amp; sanitation in the back I don&#39;t want to know about. I&#39;ve seen enough to be wary of this place. I&#39;d say the only good thing going for this place is the selection of draft beers, but don&#39;t expect the beer lines to be clean very soon &amp; if you have a question about a craft beer, don&#39;t expect an educated answer. For some reason I could not read the menu, but after reading some of the reviews, I can see that wasn&#39;t just my problem. If you build a palace to beer and also have your own name on some of the beers...have some decency to hire &amp; train enthusiastic staff about beer, you might sell some!!!"

Service was slow and not friendly at all.  Food was bland.  Husband sent back his watery pot pie.  My shrimp po boy had 6 tiny bland shrimp.  Beer selection - nothing special.

One of them did manage to look up and still no acknowledgment.  I was very patient and waited up to three minutes until another server that came to the front desk asked me &#34;How many?&#34; with a not so happy face and tone.  
So after being told to wait 15 minutes for a table, we decided to quickly order our food.  I ordered the PoBoy Shrimp Sandwich with Fries and my husband ordered the Cuban sandwich with Fries.  He also ordered a side of honey mustard for his fries.  Needless to say, they charge you a quarter for dime size of honey mustard.  RIDICULOUS!!!  Anyways, he didn&#39;t even get to enjoy the honey mustard with his fries because they brought it 10 minutes after the food was brought to us.  
Overall experience, the place is nice and the food was not bad.  My husband and I did enjoy our sandwiches, however, the fries were stale and not tasty at all.  My major complaint about this place is the customer service.  They are completely disengaged with the customer and have no personality.  It really dampens the mood of the place."

I&#39;ll likely not come back unless it&#39;s just for beer, I will say the server Lindsey was very attentive tho!  Good job"

One of them did manage to look up and still no acknowledgment.  I was very patient and waited up to three minutes until another server that came to the front desk asked me &#34;How many?&#34; with a not so happy face and tone.  
So after being told to wait 15 minutes for a table, we decided to quickly order our food.  I ordered the PoBoy Shrimp Sandwich with Fries and my husband ordered the Cuban sandwich with Fries.  He also ordered a side of honey mustard for his fries.  Needless to say, they charge you a quarter for dime size of honey mustard.  RIDICULOUS!!!  Anyways, he didn&#39;t even get to enjoy the honey mustard with his fries because they brought it 10 minutes after the food was brought to us.  
Overall experience, the place is nice and the food was not bad.  My husband and I did enjoy our sandwiches, however, the fries were stale and not tasty at all.  My major complaint about this place is the customer service.  They are completely disengaged with the customer and have no personality.  It really dampens the mood of the place."

Time of my visit: Lunch

Well, I think, I have reviewed all, but one place in that strip.  I could not decide on what I wanted to have, so I figured I would go for a burger.

Well, I arrived, I was told to sit anywhere and the waitress came by promptly.  I have asked about the special and her recommendations.  She told me the burger were pretty good, especially chicken burger, any other day, I would have opted for that, but I had chicken yesterday and was not in the mood for it.  So ended up ordering Hawaiian Burger (it came with a pineapple on top and a side of BBQ sauce), I was sold.  I took homemade chips instead of fries.

Both my water and food arrived quickly.  Let me breakdown the chips first...  They were pretty good!  There were not stale (which is a case with a lot of place), nor oily (again a case with a lot of place), pretty good!  Now, on to the burger...  Oh boy...  Disappointing...  First, a piece of advise, when you offer pineapple on a burger, ring form is usually better than chopped...  Second, I get it&#39;s pricey to keep fresh pineapples in stock, but I can tell a difference between a shitty canned pineapple (which it was) vs. fresh pineapple...  The pineapple took away from the taste of the burger, which was not all that bad.  It was not anything over the top, but about what you&#39;d accept from a bar burger.

The service was a bit inadequate as well, but friendly.  Barkeep was nice and either had a lot on her plate with the bar or was just short staffed, never had my water refilled, until I asked for a refill with my check.  I ended up going up to the bar to pay my check.

Overall a C-, could have been worse, chips and barkeep friendliness kept it from falling further down."

We walked in around 7:30 pm and there was maybe only about 5 people there. We sat at the bar and started looking at the drink menu. We were greeted almost immediately and since we weren&#39;t sure what we were having we asked for water. Bartender brings us the first and only waters of the night. Never refilled them, never asked if we wanted more, she just took our waters away after we finished. 
It was nice to see they have a variety of drinks and drink specials. My friend got the $3 Coronas and I had the $4 margarita, frozen. My rita didnt smell nor taste like one. I kept hoping it would get better so I ordered a total of 3. I really think the bartender made them virgin, no alcohol. 
The place was not busy but the bartender ignored us most of the time we were there. After we were done with drinks, rather than ask if we want another, she looked our way and went about her business, eating at the end of the bar! 
Not sure if the poor service was due to the fact that we aren&#39;t regulars, everyone else was waited on except us. A group of guys came in later and their beers were still kind of full and she was asking them if they were ready for another. My glass was completely empty, I pushed it away from me, she saw but didnt ask if I wanted another drink until like 10 min later. 
I will give them one more chance in the future and see if the service is better and I will NOT get the margaritas. The bar itself is ok, like that there is outdoor seating and its close to home. I  curious about the fruity drinks on the menu. 
Hopefully we miss last nights bartender who did nothing but stare us down, make weak drinks and stuff her face at the end of the bar."

The food is good.  We enjoyed the atmosphere when we went and the owners have always been nice.  The servers have been nice as well.  Two complaints with the place:  one: when you order food it seems to take a long time for your order to arrive and two: when they have music, it is almost always way too loud.  I think they may have fixed problem number one based on my recent experience.  My last order was almost delivered faster than I wanted.  I had an salad before my sandwich and the salad came very quickly and within a few minutes my sandwich was there too.  

Problem number two isn&#39;t a Flip Flops problem alone.  I get really tired of going to places to meet with friends and having to shout to make ourselves heard.  It might make some sense if the people in the place were dancing or something but everybody is sitting and trying to talk and these places seem intent on blasting out music.  I don&#39;t get that.

We had a coupon so even though it was kind of a drive for us we wanted to give it a try. (And we saw they have fried pickles on the menu and we are big fans of fried pickles!) We went on a Wednesday night around 6:15. (It got a lot more crowded at 7:00 and on). 

This is a really cute place with a thatched hut bar and a beach-y wall mural. The bar is big and many people sat at it and ate and drank. They have high tables and low/regular tables. 

We were treated GREAT by Dion. She gave us excellent service and was down to earth and positive. We loved that they bring you free popcorn- that&#39;s a fun touch. 

The fried pickles were good- pickle chips- and a generous portion served with a side of ranch.

I ordered the bottomless soup and salad- it&#39;s $8.99. The salad came in a huge bowl and was way too much for me but very tasty- iceberg lettuce, carrots, radishes, green olives, hot peppers, and a delicious oil and vinegar dressing. I appreciated that it didn&#39;t have cheese on it. You can order any of their soups or chili and I was hoping to try several but the servings were so huge that I only tried two. I LOVED the chicken rice soup- it was creamy and comforting and tasted just as I hoped. I wish I lived or worked closer so I could order it regularly. I also tried the minestrone which Dion said is a favorite- it was also good but I was really too full to eat much of it. I think next time I&#39;ll see if the soup could be served in cups rather than bowls- then I could try their chicken noodle soup or chili too. The soups were impressive to me (although probably not what most people think of ordering at a place like this- I encourage you to try them!) 

My husband got a burger and thought it was pretty good but a little dry. The fries were on the thick side but he thought they were good. Next time he wants to try a wrap and the spicy chicken soup. 

They have a funnel cake fry dessert which sounded clever but we didn&#39;t try it. 

They seem to have a lot of food and drink specials here and also a lot of events. I bet this is a popular place for locals. I didn&#39;t feel like I was eating in a bar- rather a casual restaurant with great food. 

I have to say that I was struck with how clean the bathroom was! Spotless. 

I think there is a jukebox thing on the wall by the bar- I didn&#39;t try it but it&#39;s a cool addition. 

I was surprised to see that they had &#34;live video gaming&#34; in the restaurant- that kind of bummed me out as we left- seeing the gambling machines. I&#39;m a therapist so sometimes have strong opinions about things that I&#39;ve seen people struggle with. So I guess that&#39;s why I took one star off (and that my husband didn&#39;t love his burger). But for my food alone and the cute theme, free popcorn and Dion&#39;s great service I would have given Flip Flop&#39;s 5 stars."

They have good food AND DRINK specials everyday.  If you sit at the bar you can get a little bit of better service, because you&#39;re right in front of the bartender.  Some nights they are so busy that unfortunately it takes awhile for your order to be taken, but the servers at least acknowledge your presence.  

The boyfriend and I go here a lot for the hawks games, and they make the night very enjoyable with ALL the t.vs including the larger projector screen with the game on, and the audio.

The drink itself was pretty good (light and fruity) and surprisingly strong.  The popcorn helps curb my appetite while I waited for dinner.  The music plays too loudly.  The food is okay.  The  Caribbean-themed decor isn&#39;t as inviting as I would have thought.

They have outdoor seating during the summer, so that&#39;s kinda nice."

They are always pleasant.  Stacy is an amazing server. The manager is always present and making sure food and drinks are correct and were happy with them. 2) the atmosphere. You dont get the typical 21 year old atmosphere like you get across  the street. Good music, nice people, fun tiki bar theme. They put all the local sports games on the many tvs they have. If you like a local bar with good prices and a great atmosphere...flip flops is your place."

The food at Flip Flops has been progressively getting better and more diverse which I love, however I still think that they are overpriced on their drinks. 

The fact they have never had weekend drink specials floors me. I worked at a bar for several years and that is the biggest day for specials, you have more of a draw, especially now with competition from Bulldog Ale House right across the street.

So food I would say 4 stars, Drinks prices 3 stars and the service 3 stars as well."

The place was empty, so ample seating was available and service was outstanding. The menu is typical pub fare. Burgers, wraps, sandwiches,  pizza. They have food and drink specials every day. I read through their mixed drink menu and like the variety. One would be able to find something tasty to drink to suit any taste. This is no Hala Kahliki, but a pretty decent drink menu. Portion sizes were pretty good too.  Food was on par for pub food. Nothing amazing, but good.  I would most definitely come back for some tropical drinks after work, or to try their outdoor patio."

The first time I went with two friends on a Thursday evening and it was a great time.  Other than us, there were only about 4 or 5 other people there, all sitting up at the bar.  Our service was very quick and the waitress was very friendly and attentive.

After having such a good first experience, I took my girlfriend there.  It was the Friday before St. Patrick&#39;s Day, so we were expecting it to be pretty busy, simply because they do sell booze.  When we got there, it was filled with a lot of bigger parties, but we managed to find the last two-top open, near the entrance.  It took about 15 minutes before anyone came up to acknowledge us.  Once our waitress took the drink order, she was very fast at coming back with it, so that was nice.  But then, it was about another 20-30 minutes before anyone else walked past our table.  I had finished my beer in that time, so I actually walked up to the bar to get my second drink from the bartender, who was also busy, but doing a great job of managing all her bar patrons.

A gentleman, who I believe was a manager, came by the table and asked how things were.  He was the first person to come by us since our waitress had brought our drinks nearly a half an hour earlier.  We were able to place our food orders with him and he must have said something to our waitress because she was much more attentive after that.

To be fair to the waitress, from what I saw, there were only two servers, one bartender, one busser, and this manager working the entire front.  Being that the entire place was filled, they didn&#39;t do a bad job.  But I would hope that management would better prepare for the future.  Not sure if this was an unusually busy night that caught them off guard, but it&#39;s St. Patrick&#39;s Day weekend...you should expect to be pretty busy (even though you&#39;re not an Irish pub) and bring in extra staff to handle to high capacity.

The beer selection is pretty good.  The food, while creatively described on the menu, is nothing really special.  Not bad, but nothing I am craving the next day.  However, the prices are pretty decent."

Probably best in the afternoon, early evening for the laid back mellowness with solid drink prices/specials and a good selection. The staff was friendly and worked hard but...the food was close to awful. I had a burger that literally tasted like soap. My wife wasn&#39;t jumping for joy with the chicken sandwich either and the nachos were mediocre agreed to hit this place again after an afternoon of golf at Glendale Lakes but not for the dinner fare.

This place is an absolute bore. I really would love to know what I am missing about this place..It always seems packed, I just don&#39;t get it.

The drinks are horrible, they are ridiculously over priced, the bartenders are rude, the food sucks, it&#39;s constantly over crowded because they let too many people in at a time, and it&#39;s so loud in there you can&#39;t even think straight, let alone order a friggen drink!

So, If you don&#39;t get the chance to come here, don&#39;t feel bad, your really not missing much, your saving yourself the hassle and headache. There are other bars around the area that are much cheaper and a lot more fun.

It was an ok place to watch the game.  Fun atmosphere, but the service was subpar.

My friend and I sat down at the only available table left--score!  We picked out what we wanted to start off with to drink right away based on the specials posted above my friends&#39; head.  And then we waited...and waited...and waited some more.  Finally after about 20 minutes of no service, I went to the bar to order....and then I got ignored there for about 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, our waitress finally came over.  We ordered our drinks, and luckily, they came out very quickly.

We got the &#34;Jamaican Me Crazy&#34; rum bucket for $10.50 on special.  It was delicious and the run hit you HARD after that, so it was definitely a generous pour.  They know how to make a good drink here!

The food that we ordered (pretzel and fries) were typical bar food and did their best to soak up the alcohol!

Maybe the service would be better had there not been a game on...but really, in Chicago, when is there NOT a game of some sort on!?"

The service is friendly and the food/drink isn&#39;t at the price of &#34;Suburban Rip-off&#34; just yet. This is a tiki-type place (bar is a gigantic grass hut) that has island inspired type menu and drinks available. I&#39;ve had the Friday fish fry and find worth a try. The Blue Moon outta the tap always kinds of tastes funny to me but let me know what you think. I found the pizza to be pretty tasty. 

Place gets a decent crowd in it for the area. Wednesday I believe is karaoke night and was a pretty good time. I saw one live act (I think they have a couple per week) that sang hits of old and new that I really liked.

Went here for the first time last night with my boyfriend. Being our first time we needed to look over the menu but were attacked by mamma meannie our waitress the second we sat down. When we didn&#39;t know our drink order her green tentacles were quickly extended and followed by the look of death. When she came back foaming at the mouth we decided we better order quickly or she was going to send us to the chamber of death. I ordered the cheese fries and my boyfriend ordered the jalapeno cheese stix for Appetizers. I must admit the jalapeno cheese stix were quite tasty and almost as hot as the fire that was breath out mamma meannie. The cheese fries were also good and had ample amounts of cheese. For dinner we each had an individual pizza. These pizzas are small. Seriously don&#39;t order this alone and expect to be full. My other complaint is getting a refill on a soft drink is harder then winning the marathon on two broken feet. If you have beer they are right on top of refills but if you have a softdrink better step aside. All in all the service here was the biggest let down. The food was ok and probably worth 3 starts but the service is some of the worst I have ever had. Should have checked Yelp before going here!!!

It was not crowded at all, but what do you expect for a Tuesday night.  Anyway, it should be more crowded.  The atmosphere is very nice and the food was delicious.  It is such a cute place, very festive and makes you want to go to the Caribbean - cute tiki bar inside.  They start you off with some complimentary popcorn, which we found to be a nice change of pace.  We ordered some sort of garlicy bread appetizer which the waitress recommended.  It was really good and the price was reasonable.  Kudos to her for that recommendation.  I ordered the unlimited soup and salad for $8.99.  The salad was huge - I couldn&#39;t eat it all.  For the soup I was given a choice of a cup or a bowl.  I chose a cup because I wanted to try several.  I started with the chili - it was quite good.  Unfortunately, after that I was full so I couldn&#39;t try the rest.   Also came with some fresh buttered breadsticks!  My husband ordered &#34;flippy&#39;s dinner salad&#34;  (name could be wrong) with added popcorn shrimp.  Again, the portion size was huge and he couldn&#39;t eat it all either.  They were extremely generous with the popcorn shrimp.  The service was great. This also  would be a nice place to watch a game.  They have quite a few tv&#39;s including a big screen.  They also have drink specials for the game and other specials as well, including a really good burger special.  There is an outdoor eating area too, away from the street which would be nice for lunch or dinner.  We often go to bulldogs, but this was a nice change of pace.

Macaroni &amp; cheese bites are good when they actually cook them all the way. $10 for the rum bucket isn&#39;t a bad price. The projection screen tv inside would be better if it was actually a dark bar and you could see what was on the screen. They&#39;d be better off getting a flat screen.

For early on a Saturday night the place wasn&#39;t too packed but still had a decent sized crowd, with people streaming in all the time.  My GF and I sat ourselves to a table and quickly had someone come over and give us menus and get our drink orders in.  

The food &amp; drink prices weren&#39;t expensive, and were inline with what you&#39;d expect from such a place ($8-9 for a sandwich/burger).   I&#39;d have to say the service was really good &amp; friendly(maybe because it wasn&#39;t crazy crowded yet?) ... our waitress came over to our table several times to check up on us and see how everything was.  She even offered to reheat our appetizer after we had gotten our meals.  

We got the artichoke/spinach dip appetizer, which came with plenty of chips and a good amount of dip.   I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich - good, but a bit overwhelmed by the spicy sauce and my GF got the burger with pineapple, she liked it and normally she&#39;s a bit picky.

Negatives - I could see parking being a problem (but wasn&#39;t that night) and I&#39;m not a fan of the whole Jimmy Buffet thing, so music-wise I would put something else on the jukebox.

Their opening was delayed by over two months but no explanation as to why. I hope they didn&#39;t miss the mark. 

I went last week on Monday night, hoping to beat the MNF crowd. I went with a large group and a few kids. We did get a table right away, but a roll of the eyes from the waitress when we asked to put two tables together. She did move it and her attitude did improve a little. We ordered a multitude of food, including burgers, kids meals for the little ones, some beer and milk for the kids. I also ordered some wings as appetizers. 

A few minutes later the waitress came back and apologized that they didn&#39;t have any milk, but they were running to get some, which was fine. That was one big plus for me. The owner/manager even came over and apologized which was a nice touch. Then it went downhill. The wings never came (I wasn&#39;t charged either so they were never ordered to begin with). My medium burger was charred, as was everyone else&#39;s. There was no ketchup to be found. They have those little 6 packs on the table to hold utensils and condiments and the three tables nearest didn&#39;t have any either. The waitress came back with one that was about 1/8th full. The milk did arrive safe and sound. 

I substituted onion rings for fries which were great. The men ordered the burger with BBQ sauce and &#34;onion rings&#34; on it but were sad to find out there was only one ring per burger. The men also complained that the TVs were too small and not enough of them for a football crowd on the weekends.

Overall, I was not impressed. I know they spent a lot of time working on the painting of the interior and the bar (which look like copies of any Jimmy Buffett bar between here and Key West), but I wish they would have spent more money on their food quality. I think the burgers would have been a lot better had they not been burned. All 4 were charred and not tasty. 

I think if you were purely going into the bar to drink rather than dine and you like the laid back atmosphere of the tropics and don&#39;t expect too much out of that type of bar, you won&#39;t be upset. However, if you are going to eat, stay away from the burgers until they get them done right. 

I&#39;ll go back and try something else next time and hopefully it&#39;ll be a better experience.

ETA: We went again, this time on a Sunday afternoon during football. The burger was still horrible. Burned on the outside and raw on the inside. My husband had the pizza and said it was bland and somewhat cold. 

I hope they get a better cook before summer comes. Otherwise, I won&#39;t go there to eat again. 

It&#39;ll be awhile before I go back there."

When we got there around 7:15, the patio was understandably full. However, my wise &amp; observant BF had noticed that there was a table outside that happened to be 2 smaller tables pushed together and only 2 people were seated there. So he made a simple request to the waitress handling the patio area that maybe they could seperate one of the tables. She abruptly brushed us off, could not be bothered with the request and was not interested in accomodating us. We were a little caught off guard by the treatment but  were unwaivering in our perservance. We headed back inside to find a table where we were thoroughly ignored by the waitstaff and after 10 minutes of waiting patiently, stomachs growling, we walked out. Never having been there before they certainly put a bad taste in my mouth.

The TV&#39;s can be a bit loud and the last time I was in here my friend and I ended up leave as soon as we finished eating to go somewhere else a little more quiet so we could actually chat.

I have tried almost everything on the menu and have been extremely satisfied with everything. 

They have a very large selection of appetizers. The boneless wings were large, meaty and the sauce was very tasty with just the right amount of spice. The nachos were huge (I could have had them for a meal) with lots of toppings. The jerk chicken is to die for! The bean dip, beer cheese, and onion rings are very good, but my favorite are the Fire Crackers.

The burgers are HUGE (almost too big), 10 ounce Angus beef and have been cooked exactly the way I wanted each time I ordered. The pizza was very good with just the right crust, not too crisp, not too chewy. The chicken sandwich is also very good, a large chicken breast with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise (I prefer it with the honey mustard sauce).

The servers and bartenders were all very nice, friendly and polite. The food and drinks were all served in a timely manner with a smile!

The atmosphere is what I like best. All of the bar is built with real bamboo and thatch roof. The tables were all hand made with various inlaid carvings. The wall sconces, signs, and  hangings give it a very cozy, laid back feel. The two wall size murals were custom painted and give a Caribbean feel which is nice in the middle of Chicago&#39;s cold winter! There are T.V.&#39;s in every corner of the restaraunt/bar, and a large screen on one wall. I was able to get the T.V. station changed to the program i wanted to watch with one simple request. The juke box holds over 30,000 songs, and the place really gets hopping on Friday and Saturday nights. I can&#39;t wait for summer to enjoy the beer garden which is just next to and across the street from Carol Stream&#39;s parks. The restrooms are very nice, neat and clean.  

The owners are extremely nice. They genuinely seem to care about all their customers and would go out of their way to make sure your visit is a satisfactory one.

The prices are all very reasonable. 

Overall I&#39;d say this by far my best restaurant experience, and I will definitely be coming back again and again!"

Cold catfish that tasted like it was fried the week before, there were two slivers of peaches in the peach cobbler and the saddest of all - they ruined banana pudding which is my absolute favorite and the deciding factor in driving all that way. They charged as much as a nice sit down restaurant to to stand and order and eat of paper plates with plastic utensils."

I ordered the fried chicken and again was really disappointed . My pieces were so dry, and wings were so small, practically had no meat on them. The pieces obviously sat for some time.  Corn was just out of a can nothing special. Corn bread again, just ok.  Besides being very pricey. 
The food being so disappointing again was not the reason I don&#39;t want to go back though primarily.  
I needed a carry out container and as I stood in line for that a lady brought her plate back up to the counter after having already been seated and her party had started eating. She informed the cashier/ server that she did not get her correct order... She asked for thighs or legs ( not sure ) but had been given wings.  The server apologized and then proceeded to remove wings from lady&#39;s plate and put them back in the serving tray... I was appalled !!  Any other restaurant would have thrown the 2 wings out ... And Not used the same tongs to mix them back into the tray that would be used to sell to others. I don&#39;t know if the woman ate them or not, seasoned them or not , or touched, spit or sneezed on them ( ok that&#39;s extreme and I&#39;m probably sure she didn&#39;t ) but still I was just really surprised she recycled them ...

The establishment itself is clean and well kept. It&#39;s a cafeteria type system when it comes to ordering your food. The line works well though and you aren&#39;t in there very long. They are closed Monday&#39;s and Tuesdays so keep that in mind. 

Now the food. Good lord the food! This is the definition of soul food and I&#39;m really surprised this place doesn&#39;t get the amount of attention it should. I usually go with the mixed fried chicken (white/dark) with two sides and corn bread. The fried chicken is fresh, crispy, and just tastes homemade. The sides are incredible you won&#39;t go wrong with whatever you choose. The mac n cheese is incredible. The mashed potatoes are perfect and the gravy has a little kick to it.

Here&#39;s some additional pre-review advice: Pack a pillow or a huge caffeinated drink for the trip back home. You will be in a food coma if you manage to finish this hearty meal. 

Every now and then I find myself desirous of something you rarely find in most restaurants. Inexpensive, flavorful veggies and something fried just right. At one time, I thought I would have to drive to the south part of the city to eat this good. Lucky for me, I can bask in this type of goodness close to the nest. 

Priscilla&#39;s is near and dear because it is seriously akin to a Sunday dinner at my grandparents place. Fried food, items smothered in gravy and lots of starches. That said, I grew up feasting like this regularly and indulging on occasion, reminds me of them and they wonderful conversations during those meals. 

Admittedly, it has taken me a few visits to remember the need to share this great find.  I have tried the mac n cheese, fried chicken, fried fish, smothered chicken, collard greens with turkey, collard greens with pork, green beans, corn, candied yams, cornbread and cabbage (over several visits of course). I seriously enjoyed every single item but if obliged to choose, I would say the fish, collard greens and candied yams are my favorites.  

Each dinner comes with 2 sides and cornbread which means in 2-3 visits you can easily have tried as many things as me. 
Happy Eating!!!!"

Pros:
- Collard greens were delish
- Smothered pork chops were tasty
- Portions are nice and large
- They try to make things fresh for you when items are out
- Very friendly!!!!!

Cons:
- Can get costly quick
- I am a spaghetti connoisseur &amp; this didnt meet my standards

It matters not what night of the week you intend to stop in. The food is fresh, plentiful, and offers countless choices to mix and match the soul food sampler of your dreams.

When my niece is in from college, we always get 2 dinners to go. Her fave: the baked chicken with olde time corn bread stuffing, and the &#39;greens&#39;. Ya gotta try the greens.

For moi: the fried chicken, not greasy and covered with spices, with candied yams, and green beans. 

Each night of the week, the menu entrees and desserts change, based on availability. And speaking of dessert; the coconut cake with light pineapple filling should not be missed; we also swear by the bread pudding.

A strange hankering for fried chicken prompted me to get a fried chicken meal (3 pieces with 2 sides and cornbread) to go. I am sorry to say the meal was pretty dismal. The fried chicken (breast, drumstick and a very small piece of thigh) had soggy skin and a few feathers from the bird still remained on the thigh. The skin was salty and the breast meat very very dry. The red beans were salty and the candied yams were sickeningly sweet (which is not unusual for candied yams though). 

Everything was pre-cooked and sitting under heat lamps at dinner time, including the fried chicken. 

I can take a great tasting meal at the expense of my waistline or heart health once in a while but a bad meal ain&#39;t worth risking nothing.

But all I saw was dried chicken that looked like it was cooked from lunch and sat there all the way to dinner under a heat lamp.

I asked the cashier what was the best there and all she did was read the menu to me . If I wanted the menu read to me I could read it myself I just wanted to know but she recommended and all she gave me was a blank stare so I ended up ordering the last thing she said which was jerk chicken with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.
 
The mashed potatoes were good can&#39;t screw that up.

The mac and cheese was really hard on the top and that part was uneatable. I ended up eating just the bottom half and throwing away the top. What a waste of money.
 
The Jerk Chicken was not jerked but chicken with jerk sauce on the side. The chicken was moist and delicious and was the only redeeming quality of this visit. The jerk sauce was way too peppery and hot it was mostly peppers and just a little bit of the other stuff to make it jerk sauce and I ended up not eating the jerk sauce and having the grilled chicken alone and if I order the grilled chicken alone it would have saved me a dollar what a waste that&#39;s two dollars now I wasted.

So when my girlfriend and I saw that Priscilla&#39;s was opening up a spot near my old house, I knew we had to try it.  We&#39;ve since come back several times, and we&#39;re always satisfied with our meal.  

I suppose I should probably start with the fried chicken dinner I always order here.  They offer you a choice of white or dark meat.  It&#39;s always dark meat for me, and they usually offer three pieces (sometimes I&#39;ve gotten four though). The meat is flavorful and you get a good-sized serving of chicken.  It&#39;s not the best fried chicken I&#39;ve had -- it&#39;s not crispy -- but it&#39;s still very good.  I&#39;ve also tried Priscilla&#39;s smothered chicken and smothered pork chops, and those are also very good.  

Each of their dinners comes with two sides.  I go for the mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese.  They give you a very generous scoop of each, and thank God they do because those are some damn good sides!  You also get a piece of cornbread with your meal.  Frankly, I&#39;ve never come across a piece of cornbread I didn&#39;t like, and their cornbread was no exception.  

On one visit, we decided to try their peach cobbler.  Sadly, we weren&#39;t fans of it even though we really wanted to like it.  Something about it was just a bit &#34;off.&#34;  It&#39;s OK though because we come here for the chicken (me) and catfish (my girlfriend).  

We&#39;ll keep coming back to this place.  The prices are reasonable, the portions are big, and the staff is friendly."

I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place since it opened because 1) I&#39;m not a soul food expert but have loved it when I&#39;ve had it and 2) there is always something comforting about fried chicken.  

So finally a situation presented itself to give it a try.   Stopped in on Sunday and got an 8 piece chicken dinner with one large side.   Ordered the mac and cheese which was awesome.  The chicken itself was tasty albeit a touch spicy for my group (kids) and I was disappointed they didn&#39;t have any chicken breasts on a Sunday at 6 but also understood it was the end of the run.  They made up for it by adding extra legs into the batch.   Also ordered the candied yams which got a mixed review due to the inclusion of a baking spice (nutmeg perhaps?).   The cornbread muffins were good but as someone mentioned, Boston Market&#39;s were better.  Also got red velvet cake which was good but not mindblowing.

The service was great - she helped me through the menus and talked about what she liked there.   Everyone was so darn friendly.

All in all, I will add this to my rotation of local carryout places and looking forward to trying some new dishes as well like the fried catfish."

The employees are are very friendly &amp; helpful if you have trouble deciding what to get.  We tried the baked chicken meal which  comes with 2 sides and a cornbread muffin.  The chicken was perfect and the sides were actually bigger than what I expected.  I chose the black eye peas (perfect!) and green beans (yum!) - both were cooked with a ham bone, based on the wonderful flavor.  Since two of us were sharing the meal for lunch (didn&#39;t want to stuff ourselves) we got an additional side of coleslaw (the BEST coleslaw I&#39;ve had anywhere...perfectly crunchy but covered in creamy &amp; tangy goodness) and an extra muffin.  The muffins were a bit on the small side (which is fine by me) but they were the only item I didn&#39;t think was as delicious as they could have been - seemed a bit on dry side.  I can&#39;t wait to go back and try some of their other offerings &amp; next time I&#39;ll try one of those amazing looking desserts, too.  Oh, and you can pick 2 meats to try different things for your meal, unless you get the 1/2 Baked Chicken of the Cornish Hens, of course.  They also have plenty of tables for dining in - based on their name I thought maybe it was just a take-out place."

This is probably my 2nd time eating here and I must say, I wish i tried it earlier. 

Not sure how the menu works, but I believe that there&#39;s different options for everyday. So obviously I looked at which day it was and just went from there. Had to go with the fried chicken dinner. 3 pieces of chicken, 2 sides, and a bread. Some may think it&#39;s a little pricey at 8.99 but I feel like it was pretty good portion. 

Though my personal opinion is just that Boston Market corn bread was better (still a little bitter). But yea, the big factor for me for giving this place 5 stars is just that the staff was very friendly. I came it and took my time while ordering and the lady behind the cash register wasn&#39;t impatient or anything. Then when I got my food from another lady, she told me to enjoy. Then before leaving, a third lady told me thanks and to have a nice day. I love good service."

In Chicago, it&#39;s hard to find good places.  There are some gems, but few and far between.  So imagine my surprise and happiness when Priscilla&#39;s Ultimate Express opened right across the street.  Not right across the street for you stalkers, but close enough.
It&#39;s kinda set up like Boston Market, where a lot of the food is already prepared and you choose what you want.  3 of us went, one had the fried chicken, one had the half broasted chicken and I had the beef short ribs.  The short ribs were doused in some sauce.  Pretty yummy but a tad salty.  The chicken dishes were both good. 
The sides.
I think the sides are excellent.  The mac and cheese is delicious.  The candied yams have some nutmeg I think in them.  It gives it a little kick.  But those are saccharinely sweet...
The collard greens are yummy and you can get it with either turkey or pork.  I got the turkey and it had a nice smoky flavor to it.
I&#39;ll be back.  The only thing that keeps me from going is the fact I&#39;m trying to cut a few pounds.  But it&#39;s definitely worth the treat!"

Southern food isn&#39;t exactly a commodity in the area, and no, Popeye&#39;s doesn&#39;t really count.

So I stopped in over lunch to see what they had. What really surprised me was... they didn&#39;t have a lunch menu. All that was there was dinner prices. Which is fine, but I picked up a baked chicken entrée meal. This set me back $10.99, plus tax, without so much as a drink!

The 8 pieces chicken meal (with one large side and possibly some corn bread) was a more reasonable $9. I thought about going with that, but that would be far too much food. As it was, I had leftovers, so $5.50 / meal isn&#39;t bad.

So I had the baked chicken, which was wonderfully moist and very well flavored, with candied yams and rice with gravy. Avoid the rice with gravy, as there was nothing particularly special about the parboiled rice or white gravy. But the candied yams tasted nice and sweet; a good example of what I was looking for when I went there.

The whole thing was accompanied by sweet cornbread (I thought you weren&#39;t supposed to use sugar in cornbread in the south?), which was buttery and very good.

Take a group here if you&#39;re going to go; they give you a ton a food, but there is a bit of a price premium to it, too."

Please see my review of the Streamwood location for my background  and love of Soulfood.

The basic premise: you get a main meal (options rotate daily), 2 sides, a cornbread muffin, and a drink. The prices are a bit high for me -- hence the 4 stars instead of 5 - but as I said, if you&#39;ve got a craving....it takes care of it. 

This location is like the cafeteria, except smaller and more compact. I mainly go for the fried chicken and the red velvet cake when I&#39;m not training. 

Around here, your options for fried chicken mainly consist of KFC and Popeye&#39;s, neither of which do anything for me. Tonight I tried the baked chicken, and it was just as good as the fried. The sides we all shared tonight were mashed potatoes, corn, candied yams and mac and cheese. My kids ate all the mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. They love it. 

Topped it off with Sweet Tea. Yum.

It&#39;s in an odd location, where the Boston Market used to be. I wish they had breakfast and lower prices. But it&#39;s worth the trip, and if you are craving fried chicken -- GO. Go right now. Get the chicken.

Amazing Fried Chicken... it does not compare to KFC, Popeyes, etc.. It is homemade goodness. Plenty of seating inside.  I wish the sauces were lableled so I knew which one was ketchup, bbq sauce, hot sauce etc.

Mac and Cheese was delicious and is a MUST SIDE.  Cheesy crust on top.  My 2nd side was the candied yams.  They were good, but I was not a fan.  There was a weird spice in there that I did not care for.  I would guess nutmeg, but I still ate it.

Corn Bread was okkkkay.  A tad bit cold.  If it was hot, it would have be real good.

Overall, very very good.  i wish the food was a bit hotter (tempature wise)  I was there toward closing, so maybe the heating lamps weren&#39;t enough at that point.

And her sides are simply amazing.  The fried chicken (all white meat for me, but they offer mixed and all dark too) is tender and juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  The fried catfish is the meatiest filet of catfish I have ever seen and the purest white in color (not grayish like some catfish).  It is also juicy on the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside.  And I love to add the hot sauce to both for  little extra kick in flavor.  

And my husband has tried almost everything on the menu now  - from ham hocks to smothered pork chops to ribs to baked chicken  - and loves it all!  The one area of the menu that we weren&#39;t particularly impressed with were the desserts but that&#39;s probably because we&#39;ve always been so full after eating the hearty entrees.

The menu is basically classic &#34;soul food&#34; i.e. collard greens, fried chicken, smothered food...etc and just like classic soul food, its great for your taste buds and your &#34;soul&#34; but bad for everything else haha. Lots of sugar, fat and salt in most of the menu items but then again most restaurants are moving in that direction these days (see KFC double down sandwich) so I don&#39;t really mind.

The Pros: Great tasting great quality food and side dishes. 

The Cons: Not great for healthy eating or people dieting. 

The Price: Very reasonable, should be under 20 (around 9-15) for a full meal.

Today my son and I went for lunch because we found a Groupon that was expiring.  We ordered a California Roll for an appetizer that was tiny for the price.  It was acceptable.

I ordered a stir fry dish with beef Mongolian style.  It was so sweet and there was way too much sauce.  It tasted like a super sweet teriyaki sauce.  I ate it, but it wasn&#39;t great.  My son ordered the Chow Fun noodle dish with shrimp.  He said this is too sweet and the shrimp are kind of rubbery.  I tasted his and yes, it was also very sweet.  The sauce on this one was described as an oyster sauce.  I don&#39;t know what that means because oyster sauce is oyster sauce.  This was super sweet.

I think the problem here is consistency.  I have been there for dinner and had the korean beef  with kim chee fried rice.  I really liked it.  The next time I ordered it, the rice was terrible.  It&#39;s okay when you have a groupon, but there are other places I would rather eat."

The service was great, wish I could remember her name, but she was awesome, personable, right on time with everything, checking on us each time something had been dropped off. Just what you expect and appreciate. 

We had the same rolls we usually do, with tuna, and salmon and eel and they were just as tasty as we like. 

Really nice atmosphere, busy as you&#39;d expect on a Friday night.... prices were reasonable too. I only wish they&#39;d expand their craft beer choices...otherwise we&#39;d go again when in St. Charles,"

For starters, the miso soup was semi cold and EXTRA salty. The sushi we ordered was the Scorpion and the Crispy Crunchy roll. The Scorpion was decent. Right amount of spice added. The Crispy Crunchy roll was too soggy and didn&#39;t taste too fresh. Both were pretty over priced for the quality. Drinks were good, but still a little expensive.

There are better sushi places in the areas, but if you are with someone who wants a noodle dish or other Asian staple, Wok n&#39; Fire is a nice option. The sushi is really over priced and the seaweed here is particularly tough to chew. Also, I&#39;ve never had a nice server. They just always do the minimum, and I&#39;ve been there over a dozen times. So when we go, we go for one of their special: 1/2 priced Maki rolls and drinks specials certain days of the week, check out their website for more specials. But my real favorite is the lunch combo: 4pc CA roll and 4pc spicy tuna plus a salad with their Wasabi Vinaigrette. That dressing is worth the trip, in fact, it really is what keeps my going back, it&#39;s addicting. The wasabi heat stings at first and quickly goes away, it&#39;s really, really good!!! Also, you can go all one way with the eight pieces and you can get soy paper vs. seaweed, that is a really good alternative, especially for kids."

A few minutes the manager came to our table and explained that the price had changed, the regular menu reflects the new price, so that&#39;s the price. Are you kidding me??!!

The food is definitely a 4. Crab Rangoon was good but I wish it had more crab in it. Had the Chilean Sea Bass and it was cooked perfectly. Flakey and the miso glaze was amazing. The only thing I didn&#39;t like on the plate was the asparagus. It had a funny taste to it and I felt the flavor didn&#39;t go with the rice and fish. I had a bite of my husband&#39;s Korean BBQ filet, that was also cooked perfectly. Tender and great flavor. There are a lot of options on the menu which is nice and same with the kids menu.

What I would give a 3 on is service and the bathrooms. You have a pretty good size kid menu, a place to park strollers but no changing table? Really? I have a 19 month old, I had to change her on the small wet and dirty counter by the sinks. I am lucky I had those hospital pads and her changing pad to lay out on top of the wet, soapy counter. It was so little her legs were dangling off. There are only two stalls in the bathroom both were dirty. No toilet paper and then there was also no paper towel. I had changed her before dinner. 1.5-2 hours later when we were paying I had to use the restroom. Guess what? Still no toilet paper or paper towels. Really? 

They bus boys cleared off our tables in a hurry. I left my daughter&#39;s sippy cup on the table and had to ask two different guys if they had seen it. One said they had and he went to the kitchen and grabbed it. Think they threw it in the trash. It was sticky and dirty, wasn&#39;t that way on the table. 

Our server was okay, felt like she was rushing us out, especially when we were settling the check. Yes there were a lot of people waiting for a table but we were a party of 11, 6 were kids. Would come back for the food, it really was amazing. Hopefully next time service is better and hopefully they get a changing table in there. Sadly I had to change my daughter in her stroller when we left. It was a bit chilly out but I didn&#39;t really have a choice. Someone also needs to check the restrooms for cleanliness every couple hours."

The fried rice is one of the best I have ever had. I order the combo fried rice (without shrimp) made with brown rice. Being a diabetic, I appreciate the availability of brown rice and I find this dish especially good made with brown rice. Another dish I enjoy is the Yakatory Beef. It is a typical Asian appetizer consisting of chunks of beef on skewers in an Asian sweet sauce, but the sauce is really well done. It is not too sweet, sour, tangy, or heavy. The beef is complimented by a light Asian slaw in a light vinaigrette dressing that is not too sweet, creamy, or tangy. As far as soups go I highly recommend the pho bowl. I always get it with wheat noodles because this is a more carb friendly option than rice noodles. I really enjoy the generous helping of fresh peppers and bean sprouts which are meant to be mixed into the soup. You can not go wrong with any of the noodle dishes. A variety of noodles are offered and you can swap out any protein or use any noodle with any protein. I recommend the curry but it is just OK. Please be aware I can not speak for the sushi or any items on the menu that swim. The dining experience is consistent at other locations."

If I ever had a taste for Asian food, I usually would frequent Thipi Thai in Glen Ellyn.

Fortunately for me, my new employer is based in St. Charles, and they treated us to a lunch as part of our orientation. What a nice touch!

We arrived at noon on a Tuesday and were seated promptly. The tagline for the restaurant is: Sushi, Stir Fry, and Bar. I knew I wouldn&#39;t be having sushi since I don&#39;t eat seafood. The Bar was out of the question because I&#39;m not a drinker and I don&#39;t think that would have gone over well with the new bosses. As a result, I was in on the stir fry! 

I had two basic options; a wok tossed entrée (protein and vegetables) served in some sort of sauce with a side of rice (brown, white, or fried rice) or a noodle dish. After some brief debate, I decided to go with Chicken Pad Thai.

Before I get ahead of myself, I should mention that they have soups and entrée salads as well. I actually ordered the hot and sour soup, which had tofu, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms with white pepper and vinegar. It had a nice flavor with a bit of kick, but not too spicy. I am a wimp when it comes to hot items, but this was nothing.

As for my Pad Thai, it was excellent! Slightly Sweet and Sour, it had tofu, scallions, bean sprouts, carrots, and crushed peanuts. I ate the first half with chopsticks but after that I realized I was hungry and wanted more noodles faster, so I switched to the fork!

All in all, a solid place for a meal. I&#39;ll be interested to possibly try some of their appetizers and sides on my next visit!"

My usual experience would be 4 stars but this most recent would be a zero. Generously a zero. 

First, there was a line of people waiting for tables in the cocktail section politely. A mother and em daughter pair were waiting in front of an empty table when a woman cut the entire line and hijacked their table. The mother kindly told the lady there was a line and they were next, but the lady said &#34;oh that&#39;s funny.&#34; And wouldn&#39;t move from the table. When the pair spoke to a manager, she said she couldn&#39;t do anything about it and offered them a free appetizer. Fortunately for the mother and daughter, a new table opener up quickly. Unfortunately for my friend and me, we waited another 15 minutes before getting a table. The manager offered us no free appetizer or any sort of condolence, despite the fact we lost a table just as much as the ladies in front of us did.

Secondly, my friend and I sat at the next available table which was for a party of 6. After our drinks and soup came out, we noticed the next people in line were a party of 4 trying to squeeze into a table for two. We felt bad hogging such a large table so we offered to take the two-top so they could have a more comfortable one. When we explained to the server that we wanted to move so the people next in line could have a table, she gave us a bit of an attitude.

Apparently, you are rewarded for being a table-steal you-know-what, but when you give a table away, you are met with an attitude."

I went last night, split an order of lettuce wrapped shrimp things and an order of Bao bun somethings (I know, great detail huh?) and a couple glasses of Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc. We sat and talked and ate and talked and had wine and talked and it really was nice. At no point did our server make us feel like we had to rush out or order more than we wanted.

We have a few excellent sushi places in the area and Wok n Fire is definitely one of them. Non traditional, well priced sushi with a good wine list and excellent service.

Go."

We wanted to split a wok-tossed tofu dish with brown rice and instead of giving us one dish and two plates to separate the food by ourselves they brought out two dishes with one scoop of brown rice on each and it was a big serving of veggies and tofu. BTW, we could not decide between brown rice or fried rice and Javier (waiter) brought out both. So the waiter was really paying attention to us. 
I don&#39;t like to each most types of sushi cause of the whole raw food thing but get the St Charles Roll as recommended by my Wifey and her GFs. It was excellent and had no fish taste or raw fish that I saw. ;) The St Charles Roll has a little spicy kick to it but soooo good."

The only thing I don&#39;t like: some of their sushi rolls are so giant you have to cut them in half in order to eat them.

Good enough for lunch and Cheap! I ordered the lunch combo which came with a california roll and a few nigiri rolls and it came with soup or salad, so definitely a good amount of food for lunch and only 10 bucks! I ordered the egg drop soup which I though was too salty. The sushi was good, but nothing special. Granted I didn&#39;t get any Maki or signature rolls, so maybe I will go back and try something more elaborate but those rolls are also more expensive. It is a nice restaurant, good for a night out, good drinks and a big menu. But for me the best sushi comes from smaller places, so based on the sushi solely I give it a three."

The ambiance is like nothing else in St. Charles, and it&#39;s a great place to go with friends. The servers and hostesses were really friendly while I was there. 

Although we had to wait for a table regardless of our reservation, I felt we were a priority for the hostess and they made the wait enjoyable. We decided to order off the sushi menu and our waitress was very friendly and accommodating since we were only ordering one-two plates at a time--and the food was fabulous! Definitely try the St. Charles role while you&#39;re there.

The restaurant is always clean, and my service has always been good. My one suggestion for the actual building is that someone needs to do something about the small step into most of the booths. I&#39;ve seen someone fall or nearly fall leaving almost every time I&#39;ve eaten here. 

The restaurant is always crowded for dinner, and I find the music is good - but always louder than I would like. We enjoy eating sushi here - but the price is definitely high unless you come during happy hour. I also enjoy the pad Thai and chicken lettuce wraps, and always save room for their mango cheesecake - my favorite dessert. Personally I feel the price is a bit higher than the quality on all fronts - but I&#39;ve never had anything bad. However, I definitely would not be willing to wait long to eat here as some people do. Will continue to go back when invited by others, but don&#39;t seek it out on my own."

We all basically had sushi and were elated at the quality and flavor. They do it right here. The stirfry, although we didn&#39;t have it, looked/sounded delicious as well.

The staff was very friendly and super accommodating to my friend who has food allergies and also spot-on with drinks and water refills.

Our waitress was very friendly and was quick to bring us drinks. It took us a while to order, and she did not rush us at all. Eventually, we decided to start with the Maki roll appetizer. While they were good, they weren&#39;t the best Maki rolls I&#39;ve ever had, and I felt it wasn&#39;t worth the price. However, it was a nice variety of 4 different types of rolls.


For dinner, I ordered the sesame chicken with brown rice. The presentation was very appealing. Although, if it weren&#39;t for the addition of mango to the sesame sauce, the meal would not have been anything special. The hint of sweetness from the mango provided a unique and pleasant twist to an otherwise traditional and underwhelming dish. My friend ordered the Kung Pao shrimp and said it was very good. For dessert, we ordered Mochi and mango cheesecake. Both were very tasty, especially the cheesecake.


Everything was tasty, but I felt it was overpriced. However, because the service was exceptional and the mango cheesecake was to die for, I would eat here again."

Aesthetically, this place gets 5/5. It&#39;s beautiful. Almost like if Beyoncé was an Asian interior designer. When you walk in you see a big Buddha. My dad would love that in his backyard. I love the dark furnishes with the ever changing LED lights around the place. Even the bathroom looks amazing. Best bathroom since Paris in Vegas. You&#39;re gonna wanna just eat and drink a lot just to continually use it. 

Food is good, not amazing. A little on the pricey side. Personally I&#39;m not a fan of going out for Asian food being Asian myself. I had the lad nar (I just call it ladna). I felt like there was way too much broccoli on it but the flavor was good. 

Now the most important part, alcohol. Which is pretty much the main reason why I come here. That sake on happy hour is gonna get you. $3 warm liquid killer. The mixed drinks are pretty good too. The bartenders are not only friendly and talkative but they make great suggestions. 

The interesting thing about this place is that it was more poppin on a Monday night than on a Sunday. I guess Monday is the new Sunday here. Just remember, WOK don&#39;t run! Hail hydra."

Seated in a large booth we reviewed the menu. It was our first visit to any of the Wok N Fire restaurants. We ordered some carryout once at my sister in law&#39;s house that was yummy. We quickly decided on lettuce wraps to start (minus the mushrooms). Then we learned that they can&#39;t make them without the mushrooms because the filling is premixed. This was a disappointment, but we had a backup plan. We went with the pan seared dumplings filled with chicken and veggies. These were very dense.  I was a nice surprise. And they didn&#39;t fall apart when you cut them. Again, this is a plus. 

The hubby order Szechwan Steak with veggie fried rice. I had two delicious bites off his plate. It was sweet and spicy. He really enjoyed it. I went with Bangkok Garlic Pepper Shrimp. This had a light, tasty sauce, peapods, carrots, onions and mushrooms. I went without the mushrooms and included a side of brown rice.  It was my first time eating brown rice and I thought it was great!  A little nutty almost. It was perfect mixed with the sauce. 

First impressions are not always what they seem. At the beginning of the meal, the server was not my favorite person at the table. She threw the appetizer plates on the table and didn&#39;t seem to be paying attention. But, then she got the orders right, kept our glasses full without prompting and wrapped and labeled our leftovers. These are the more important details to me and she got them right. The hubby even noticed and he doesn&#39;t notice much. ;-)

My wish list includes having the nutritional information available on their website. I&#39;m counting calories and I had to guess because they don&#39;t have that available. 

All in all, a delicious meal and we will be back soon."

This time my wife and I ordered sushi and it was all delicious and well prepared.

The prices were high which caused a bit of sticker shock, but when the rolls came, it was definitely worth it as the rolls here are usually 8-10 pieces where the same rolls at other sushi places are only 6-7 pieces, plus the quality was excellent.

We had so much sushi that we had a hard time eating it all, since we were expecting smaller rolls.  When we come back, we will make sure to order one less roll next time so we won&#39;t leave feeling like we&#39;re about to explode!  :)

This location is a hike for me, so when I heard that they are opening a location in South Barrington, I was very pleased and will eagerly look for news of its&#39; opening."

I would say it&#39;s a better quality PF Chang with sushi!  BTW, their nigri is fresh but no word on their sushi because I haven&#39;t tried any of their rolls. Oh, I also enjoy their drinks. I really like their homemade ginger ale (with your chose of hooch- I prefer Jameson) but their mixed drinks and martinis, aren&#39;t too shabby either. 

I like this place because it&#39;s a pretty hip spot for St. Charles, has a great location downtown, and has plenty of parking.  The prices are $11-14 for dishes and I usually can take home half for another meal later, which is sweet."

Prior to my visit on Friday, 13-Sept-13 I hadn&#39;t made a visit since the summer months (May-July) when she was our server on many occasions. Being that I&#39;m a regular there, she and a lot of the staff remember my order pretty well which is definitely proves great customer service in my book!

The staff pays great attention to details on drink orders (splash of mixer, no eggs in entrees ect...) and is usually very attentive to customers. Happy Hour is from 9-11p M-Sa and features half priced house rolls and appetizers when sitting in the bar. Great idea for a pre-game if you plan on checking out the Downtown St. Charles bar scene.

If you like a &#34;kick&#34; with your rolls, I highly recommend the Crazy and Mexican Rolls year round and the Tequila Roll when it&#39;s available during the summer months.

Let me just start by saying that the food was amazing. We had no problems there. Our waitress was sweet as can be and very attentive. The bus-boys were busting their butts cleaning and being awesome. 

However, the customer service by the hostess stand was TERRIBLE. Five people (high schoolers?) were standing at the hostess station when my family arrived. Out of all them, no one so much as looked up from their phones to greet me. It wasn&#39;t until I waited, and said &#34;HELLO!&#34; very loudly, that someone looked at me. Even then, the girl said that she couldn&#39;t help me. She said I&#39;d have to wait for the girl on the phone to put my name down for waiting. 

Once this other girl finally paid attention to me, we were told a half hour wait. I put our name down and waited. .and waited. . and waited. We watched as families without reservations came in AFTER us and were seated. We watched as people sat on the high bar stools for a drink, ordered appetizers and were then moved to tables. We checked back every 20 minutes thinking we missed our names, or that our buzzer was broken. It wasn&#39;t. After an hour and fifteen minutes of standing (there are no chairs or benches. You are screwed.) we were finally shown to a table by a hostess who didn&#39;t say a word to us. 

I mean, REALLY?! We were standing not even 10 feet from the hostess stand the entire time. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The childish behavior and lack of customer service was enough for me to call it quits."

It attracts 20-30 somethings (which is interesting, because I didn&#39;t realize there are single, professional 20-30 somethings in the far western suburbs of Chicago).

Anyway, it seems like a good date spot. But the food options for vegans and vegetarians stink.

For one thing, they don&#39;t have any vegan or vegetarian sushi rolls (though I think they could make some).

Secondly, of their stir-fry and noodle dishes, only a few are actually vegetarian (the Szechuan, Chinese brown and teriyaki); all the rest contain oyster sauce. So make sure to ask questions if you&#39;re a strict vegetarian.

My mom and I shared a Szechuan vegetable and a Chinese brown with tofu (both $12 a piece). The dishes tasted exactly alike: corn-starchy sauce without any flavor, covering a variety of vegetables. While I liked the vegetable mix, and the option for brown rice, the sauce was just terrible. Worse yet, they put in a ton of chili, which just ended up in a spicy sauce that had no inherent flavor on its own. All burn, no delight.

The service was not very good either. Our server wasn&#39;t particularly friendly and took a good 10 minutes to bring us water and a ginger soda we ordered.

The weird thing is that I&#39;ve been to two other Wok N Fire branches and didn&#39;t have nearly as bad an experience. Then again, I was less discerning in the past.

I would not come back here unless I were desperate. If you&#39;re vegan or vegetarian, go two doors down to Prasino, which has much better food in a much better environment."

My own imposed rules for any review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Must order something unique each visit.
3. If they have any &#34;signature&#34; items on the menu, you must order a &#34;signature&#34; item at least once.
4. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Wok N Fire

Location/Layout - 6.5/10:  Located essentially in the former Piano Factory section of downtown St. Charles.  The restaurant is in the Southeast corner of the shopping/condo development.  Parking is available adjacent to the restaurant of in the parking garage of the complex.  The interior is what sets this place apart from a lot of other restaurants.  The design is extremely modern and very campy Asian.  There is color changing LEDs everywhere along with Giant Buddha and Dragan statues.  This lighting effect is interesting in the bar and eating area and can add a nice mellow ambiance.  On the other hand it can be extremely disorientating in the small confined washrooms.  I would not be surprised if someone had a seizure based on how the strobe and color changing affect bounces off the dark tile walls.    

Menu - 6.5/10:  Wok N Fire&#39;s options are focused on Americanized Cantonese and Thai offerings with their own take on fresh Sushi offerings.  There are some Asian inspired appetizer options along with a limited desert menu.  

Service - 6/10: We are always quickly greeted by a Hostess, although the Hostess stand is hidden and your natural flow on entry makes you want to enter the bar area which is opposite of where the stand is located.  We have eaten in both the bar and restaurant area and have had good service in both areas, although the bar area has always had more patrons and seems to get more attentive service.

Food - 6/10: The food has always been very good and of above average quality, with the exception of the desserts.  We have sampled several desserts and they are all just average in quality, with the chocolate cake being the best of the options, but all taste like they are standard premade and thawed.  We have never sampled the Sushi options and can not speak to those offerings in either taste or quality.  The main dishes themselves are not overly large and come with either a rice or noodle option.  Both the chicken and steak options are very good and tender.  The heat level of dishes, such as the Kung Pao, seems to vary from visit to visit, and can lack heat one time and scorch you the next.  The vegetable eggrolls are the star of the appetizer offerings and are ordered every time we visit.  We have had two issues with the food; coincidently both occurred on a single visit.  The first was that our order of Kung Pao was missing peanuts, which was quickly rectified once it was pointed out to the server.  The other issue was that there was a sticker that said SAT in my cashew beef.  We later found out when the manager came over to apologize that this was caused by the dishes being pre-measured and bagged for future use.  While I do not have an issue with this in concept, it does make me question the freshness, but the manager was very apologetic and made the situation right in very short order.  Pricing is fair for the main dishes but the appetizers, desserts, and drinks are very expensive.  

Drinks - 6/10:  Wok N Fire has all the standard soft drink options.  Where they excel is that they offer a very trendy bar along with upscale, both in pricing and pairings, mix drinks.  They do offer several beer options, most in bottle and do offer a select number of Asian brews, which is a nice touch, given the restaurants format.

Overall Experience - 6.5/10:  This is a compromise restaurant for me and my girlfriend.  I love Asian cuisine and she does not at all.  Fortunately, Wok N Fire has enough Asian fusion with an American emphasis that we can both be happy.  Additionally, they offer a unique atmosphere that is intimate enough for us to have a nice dinner or lunch and enjoy each others company."

When we were seated at our table, the waitress immediately came over to the table for our drink order.  I asked for a drink menu and said that I would like some time to look it over.  She came back to the table 4 more times in less than 5 minutes asking for our drink order.  We felt very rushed and continued to experience that feeling the rest of our short dinner.  Once drinks arrived, we experienced the same behavior with our order.  The waitress came over every 2 minutes asking for our order.  We finally placed our order with the hope that we would be allowed some time to relax and enjoy our drinks.  Within 2 minutes the food was in front of us.  We ordered 2 meals with chicken and both had  chicken which contained a lot of gristle. Numerous times we were asked by several people if we were done or did we want a box.  We were both very uncomfortable with the pushiness and we were unable to enjoy our Anniversary dinner.  We were never asked if we wanted a second drink, and were given the bill quickly.  We were in and out in about 45 minutes.  It was extremely disappointing. We eat out at least once a week and enjoy many restaurants in the Fox Valley area.  We would not recommend this restaurant."

Food was OK.  We had went planning to order sashimi/sushi but found the menu a little limited for our tastes in that area.  We picked one roll (that didn&#39;t have mayo or Sriracha sauce on it) as an appetizer and it was good.  
We ended up ordering noodle dishes instead (seemed to be their strength) that were ok - little light on the meat.  
Maybe if we had come at night with the intention of drinking it would have been better."

I&#39;m not sure what has happened in the past year but this place has totally gone downhill. 

A couple of months ago I ordered two Chinese CHICKEN salads for my boss and I. When I got back to work and unwrapped the package I learned there was no CHICKEN. I called and spoke with the general manager. He insisted that I bring both salads back in order to prove there was no chicken. He claimed that people have said that before just to get free food. I absolutely refused to bring my salad back because I had already opened it. It&#39;s such a large salad that is spews over the sides. Also, my boss had almost finished her.

Instead the GM and I agreed a photo would be acceptable. When I returned to pick up my chicken he held the chicken hostage behind his back until I showed him the pictures. 

He offered no apology, no compensation, not even a welcome back. I told him that I would not be returning and that I would let my entire office know of my experience.

Well, a few months passed and I decided to give them another try. I ordered pad Thai a few times and the sushi sampler and it was fine. On black Friday I had a hankering for the Chinese Chicken Salad. So I ordered it. 

It was in terrible shape. The lettuce was old and wilted and BLACK. The grilled chicken was very very old and the crispy noodles on top were not the normal noodles they put on the salad. 

I decided once again to boycott. That is, until today. When I forgot to bring lunch and decided that I just have to have the Chinese Chicken Salad. I mean, the dressing is just so damn delicious I crave it. 

I picked up my salad as usual. The girl at the stand was very nice. I inspected my salad to ensure the chicken was there, and it was.

I got back to my desk and started to remove some noodles, because there are way too many, and noticed a booger like lettuce. As I picked more through the salad I noticed a lot of brown/black edges, soggy wilted lettuce, you get the idea. 

I walked back over and returned my salad. The AGM, Ben was very very friendly and apologized. He offered to make me something else but I declined and just requested my money back. 

Ben&#39;s response compared to the GM&#39;s response a few months ago was great. He apologized, he shook my hand he offered to fix it. Ben may be Wok N Fire&#39;s only saving grace. 

I can tell you right now that I am officially boycotting Wok N Fire and never ever going back. Not just this Wok N Fire, but all of them. 

There are many other experiences I can share with you, such as slow wait staff on a slow afternoon, incorrect food orders being given and non refill of sodas and water.  I am so disappointed but I suppose I live and I learn."

It is certainly not a place to come to for a romantic dinner.  The sushi was good, but it seemed like every roll came with shrimp tempura!!  We had to search high and low for rolls without the shrimp tempura.  The ones we got were very tasty.  However, I wish they would tell you how many pieces come with each roll.  We ordered three rolls and two had 8 pieces and one had like 12!  Luckily, we only ordered three rolls. We always tend to overorder on the sushi.  

We also had the lettuce cups, those are always good!  Fun place and good food, definitely be prepared for the noise level."

The Wok n Fire in South Barrington has surpassed this St. Charles location since they opened last year. Food and service are much better in SB overall. However, we had fantastic service tonight at the St. Charles location, our server was more than accommodating and super friendly. The one complaint we had was the women&#39;s restroom. It used to be super clean and tonight it was a mess with paper towels on the floor and one of the two stalls had water on the floor. It also could use a baby changing table."

Suburban cougars and wannabe MILFs scream from the top of their lungs every time one of their girlfriends walk through the door...quite a primitive greeting.  Quite annoying.

That&#39;s right, this is where the &#34;woo-hoo&#34; girls hang out, except they&#39;re not girls anymore.

My husband and I walked in on a Friday night at 7pm without reservations.  First mistake.  We were quoted with an hour and fifteen minute wait.  Pager in hand we loitered.  (You can leave your phone number instead if you want to walk around outside).  

We kept eyeing the bar area that consisted of your typical bar + just a handful of bar stools, a few high tables with chairs and a couple lounge-like benches with a small coffee tables.  

A table in the bar area opened up so we ran over to claim it.  Only two servers were working in this area, both of which must have decided that my husband and I were perfectly content with our empty drinks and no food.  My husband attempted numerous times to get the servers&#39; attention.  We truly felt as if we were being ignored.  I understood that it was a crazy busy Friday night, but when a couple of girlfriends walked in and were approached by the server almost immediately while my husband and I had been waiting for 30 minutes, I thought I was going to loose it. 

Who wants to wait 30 minutes at a table before you can hunt down a server to even say hello to you?

I finally waived down one of the servers who apologized for the oversight and was sincerely sweet throughout our dinner.  She definitely made her best attempt to show us extra attention.  

To make matters worse, our food was horrible.  My husband ordered the Orange Peel Chicken which was so sweet that he could not finish it.  I ordered the Bangkok Garlic Pepper Tofu which was bland but I did enjoy the fact that they offered brown rice at no extra charge.  Both our dishes could have also used more veggies. 

I&#39;ve had better Asian food at P.F. Chang&#39;s and Ben Pao&#39;s.

This is NOT a complete rant....

What would bring me back to Wok n Fire?  

*The drunken master ginger ale infused with mango (other choices included raspberry, vanilla, and pomegranate).  It was refreshing, sweet, and reasonably priced ($6.25).

*The Thai crepe.  Savory crepe stuffed with shrimp and chicken and sprinkled with crunchy bean sprouts.  Asian coleslaw was served on the side with crunchy noodles, peanuts with a light and sweet vinagrette.

*The sushi.  Still must give it a try."

The place is dark-ish inside but seems nicely decorated. Our server didn&#39;t offer any ordering information even after learning we were first-timers. We decided to order a round of vegetable spring rolls, which were nice and crispy outside. We also ordered a couple of PAMA Razz-tinis, which were really delicious! Once we had perused the menu, we chose the Kung Pao Chicken noodle dish and the Glass Noodles with Chicken. Both arrived after a bit and looked very good, but then we noticed that a lot of oil had been used during cooking. So much so that it was a little unappetizing to eat the food. Seriously, there was so much oil! I think other than that, the food would have been fine. My Kung Pao had a nice spice to it, and the veggies were cooked perfectly. So I guess we had a mixed bag experience. Hubby said he didn&#39;t like it enough to go back, so there you have it. :("

Now this is not a large resturant so if you are gonna go, make a reservation

Now the food, Im a sushi person so I went for the rolls. Now at first I loved them all but their specialty rolls are the size of a california! And they charge $17-18 each so  dinner for two is easily $80 and with no soup, salad or anything! Now after coming back the rolls were not good at all. Honestly I&#39;ve gone now 5 times and will NOT be going back. If you want some good sushi and your in the fox valley area skip Wok N Fire"

The decor was like a something you&#39;d see in a nice downtown Chicago restaurant... but we were in the suburbs!

The place was dimly lit, but had an ever-changing color display of lights throughout the restaurant. A large gold Buddha staged in red light is what you see in the entryway. The lounge area is to the left and restaurant to the right. We were seated at a booth (party of 8) by a golden dragon wall piece, again immersed in color-changing lights.

Food was excellent (by suburban standards). Two people in our party agreed that the coconut shrimp appetizer was the BEST they have ever tasted and said they could easily come back and order a few rounds of those as their meal. I ordered basil chicken with brown rice (from their wok tossed entrees), which was nicely presented and had great flavor. Their freshly made ginger ale with flavored vodka was great too. I had one with pomegranate and got to try one with vanilla. Both were tasty and refreshing, but not too heavy on the alcohol.

I laughed when each person who eventually made a trip to the restrooms came back exclaiming, &#34;You gotta go see the bathrooms. They&#39;re beautiful!&#34; I did check out the men&#39;s room and, indeed, it was quite nice with round glass sinks, excellent tile work, more colored lights (see a pattern here?). I opted not to take a picture inside the restroom, for obvious reasons.

Great place for a nice dinner with a group of friends. A little more on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. The restaurant is on the corner of a modern parking structure near the river, but don&#39;t let that fool you. St. Charles is the right town for this classy suburban restaurant and the parking structure just adds to the convenience of your visit."

My husband gets the pineapple fried rice from here, which he enjoys.  He doesn&#39;t like his dish spicy at all and they happily oblige.

The inside of the restaurant is not very big, and I get the feeling they probably do more take-out than sit-down orders.  However, it is clean and classy inside for however long you are in there.

The food was decent, but it was nothing that I would return or make a special trip for.  It&#39;s what I like to call &#34;good in a pinch&#34; food.

Nothing was awful, though the satay was super dry, but nothing really stood out either.  I guess out of everything the Crab Rangoon was the best, and the peanut sauce that came with the satay was pretty amazing, but the main dishes were just alright.

Since it was our first time, we got the usual dishes that we use to judge Thai food: Panang Curry and Pad Thai. We also tried the crab rangoon and chicken satay.

Both entrees were good, not great. I ordered the crab rangoon after seeing other reviews calling out how good it was, and it didn&#39;t disappoint. It came with a clear-ish dipping sauce that was similar to a sweet and sour with maybe a hint of heat.

The peanut sauce that came with the chicken satay was excellent, which was good because the chicken was dry. There were also some chunks of satay that looked a little rough. Probably should have been tossed out.

We might be back, but we&#39;ll try some others nearby first. If you are closer to Bloomingdale or Roselle, try V Thai on Lake St."

The noodles were an ok consistency (not as chewy, maybe?), and the broccoli and chicken seemed fresh. However the sauce was different, like soupy-er and not as brown in color as all of the other sauces I have had. I think I&#39;m used to this dish being more pan-fried a bit instead of gravy-ish, if that makes sense. The little cucumber salad was awesome! The soup though...not enough ginger or cilantro, and no rice in it at all. It was just bland, which I&#39;m sad about. The good things are that a lunch special is only $7.99, and the service was beyond fast! It look only 45 minutes from the time we sat down until we left. Not bad for a weekday lunch! Since there are not many Thai places around, I would probably go back if I&#39;m craving it."

Service is acceptable, the guy running tables seemed like a stoner who couldn&#39;t keep up with a fairly slow lunch period. Overall as a business lunch place I&#39;d call it an 8/10, the lunch combo is decent food for the price (soup + 2 spring rolls or salad + main for $7 as of writing) so it&#39;s hard to complain.

The restaurant is cute and clean and the staff is friendly.
I hate to say this but I typically order from here because it&#39;s a &#39;last resort&#39; for Thai food in the area. As an American-Thai person growing up in an entirely Thai cultured home, I&#39;m probably a bit more biased about Thai foods/entrees. 
All the times I&#39;ve had their food, I&#39;ve been disappointed. Perhaps the owners have super &#34;americanized&#34; their recipes, in which case, fine. Their restaurant, their choice. The most popular Thai dish, Pad Thai, has been less than good. They use the much thinner noodles than the traditional pad thai noodles and the sauce is so bland. I can&#39;t quite figure out what sauce they use, but the dish comes out very slightly &#34;wet&#34;, or soupy, which is way off for pad thai. The Pad See Ewe is also very bland and again, also wet. It&#39;s just a weird thing for these particular dishes. The egg is like a mixed fried egg instead of stirred into the mix of noodles. The lard nar is okay, but even the gravy is very thin and light in color. It should be a thicker consistency and like a brown color. Theirs is kind of ... grey. 
The chicken has been fine - cooked right, not over or undercooked. The shrimp however has been smaller in the past year and it usually seems hard. Shrimp should never be hard. Period. 
The garnish that comes with pad thai seems to overwhelm the dish itself which has me questioning if they use less noodles and meat. If so, that&#39;s not cool. I don&#39;t want to pay for a heap of carrots, cabbage, and bean sprouts. 
It&#39;s very sad because I really keep hoping that if I go back after a few months, it&#39;ll be so much better. Even a little better. But it hasn&#39;t been."

This was one of those places. A couple weeks ago, I finally made it out here for dinner with a friend.... after missing the entrance and parking in the lot of the abandoned diner next door, of course.

It is very small inside, but very cute with bursts of color and happy elephants! After we sat, we had two different people come up to ask and if we were ready to order. We asked them to give us a little time but I was confused why two ladies seemed to be our waitresses in this tiny place. My friend and I both decided to get Pad Thai -- his with chicken, mine with tofu. I also ordered a coconut bubble tea.

My bubble tea was terrible. The balls were mushy and misshapen. Tasted blah. My server looked sad when I asked her to take it back, but I couldn&#39;t stomach any more of it (and at least I said something instead of complaining online!). I hope the bubble tea isn&#39;t always like this (and I really hope I didn&#39;t hurt her feelings). My dish was good, but kind of lacked flavor. Both of us cleaned our plates, though. It was just the right portion. Then we stayed another two hours to chat while they kept filling up our waters (props for this). Our bill was reasonable -- about ten dollars each.

I have mixed feelings about this place. The decor is fun, service is awesome, the food is OK, and the bubble tea wasn&#39;t worth it. I really hope it was just a random lackluster day as I plan to come back a few times this summer since I&#39;ll be working around the corner."

The dish was also about room temp.

The people I was with had slightly better experiences with their meals, so that is why I&#39;m giving a 3 star review vs a two. Overall, service was good, prices were about average for the type of food, but the food itself was lacking."

Medical Center. I found it on Yelp, after leaving the appointment, hungry and with an itch for Thai food. It&#39;s a short hop and a skip from the medical center, extremely easy to find. The dining room is no more than a storefront, but very clean, bright and cheery, with comfy, glass top tables, covering a pretty pattern. I read in another review that it&#39;s chilly, and I found it to be so, too, particularly on this cold winter afternoon. It would be great if they could think of a way to improve their heating system output. I found a great way to bust the chill, however, in a large pot of hot Jasmine tea, which was quite tasty.

I started with spring rolls, and was pleased to find them very fresh-tasting, with delicate wrapping, yummy inner ingredients and a delicious, light plum sauce, to which I give high marks. I moved on to one of my favorite staples--chicken satay. On the up aside, I loved the fresh cucumber salad and the shredded lettuce and bean sprouts that adorn the chicken pieces. The best aspect of this entree is the peanut sauce, presented as a generous serving, heated, very creamy and most flavorful. I give it an A. The one disappointing feature, however, was the satay itself, served in a unique preparation. In fact, I&#39;ve never had a satay like this. The pleasing aspect of a chicken satay is the meat being thinly sliced, flavorfully grilled, served on wooden skewers and, normally, very tender. The Happy Elephant has a very different approach to chicken satay, however: chicken chunks are battered and deep-fried, served off-skewer, on the plate, next to the shredded lettuce and sprouts. Not only is the grilled flavor lost in a fattier, starchy cooking style, but I&#39;m sad to say the chicken chunks weren&#39;t the least bit tender; they were very chewy and actually tough in spots. If the chef asked my feedback, I would recommend they abandon this unusual twist to this popular dish for adoption of the traditional preparation. It&#39;s a shame, too, because the inferior style detracts considerably from the exceptional peanut sauce.

I moved on to another favorite of mine: pad Thai with tofu and the .99 extra peanut sauce. I give this one high marks; again, the ingredients were marvelously fresh, the thin noodles soft and delicate, and the tofu had a lovely taste and texture. My enjoyment of this dish went a long way for offsetting my disappointment with the overly tough chicken chunks. The added peanut sauce was an inspiration, given how really special it is at the Happy Elephant. I&#39;d like to mention, too, I had a glass of Thai iced coffee, which was excellent: a tall glass, sweet cream and good, chilled coffee over ample ice. 

As I was taking a lot of it home, I asked for an added to-go item: a coconut milk soup with lime juice and lemon grass, enhancing a chicken broth. It&#39;s among my husband&#39;s favorite at a Thai restaurant, so I wanted to treat him to this special plus, along with the other leftovers, when I returned him in the evening. He loved the spring rolls and pad Thai, and was delighted with the coconut soup.

I&#39;d like to say a word, too, about the service. A very lovely, friendly and extremely efficient, young woman waited on all the customers single-handedly and she was attentive, knowledgeable and very courteous. When I asked to take leftovers home, she brought containers to my table and packaged up everything herself, stacking all containers neatly in a tightly cinched bag to prevent spillage. Everything made it home in perfect condition. The one, unisex washroom at the back of the dining room was spacious and exceptionally clean and comfortable. Most impressive of all was the bill: with everything I ordered, the total tab was only $30, which I call an exceptional value, especially given the overall high quality of the service and food, minus the disappointing satay.

I&#39;m not an elephant, but I left a happy customer at least, and like an elephant, I won&#39;t forget this fun stop for good, reasonably priced Thai food next time I&#39;m in the Elk Grove Village vicinity."

We wanted to try a new Thai place in the burbs. It&#39;s located in a strip mall so there was plenty of parking. Place is cute, 24 seats include a long bench against the walk. Clean and bright fun looking paintings on the wall. We ordered beef pad Thai it was good. I like mine with hot sauce. panang chicken curry good but wanted sauce thicker though, Thai basil fried rice was good, more of a short grain rice so not as fluffy. They can leave out the raw jalapeno slices toppings out. serving size enough for two of all dishes. Not bad. Took home fried rice. service is friendly, music background is modern and mellow. Overall nice experience, will come back again to try out other dishes. Got a coupon for free egg rolls for our next visit see you then!"

I&#39;ve been eating here before ownership changed from the last Thai place and it became Happy Elephant, so I&#39;m not new to the game. For years it was a great suburban go-to place. 

But I took my dad here in June for Father&#39;s Day, and the waiter (a new face I had never seen) snapped at us. SNAPPED. I had asked if he could bring some condiments- super kindly, mind you- and he snapped back, &#34;Ummmm. I only have two hands. You&#39;ll have to wait.&#34; As a social worker and as someone who has worked years in restaurants, I was taken aback, but quickly responded, &#34;There&#39;s no need to snap. I myself worked in restaurants for a long time and know it is difficult work. We would appreciate a little more respect as patrons of your restaurant.&#34; to which he had no reply. I had hassled him in no way, and his response was rude and inappropriate. 

I came in about two weeks after that hoping he would not be there (he wasn&#39;t) but my to-go order was TINY- about 1/3 the amt you would get at any Thai place in the city. I also had requested extra veggies and there were no veggies to be found, only a few lonesome bean sprouts. Sorry to say I will not be coming back."

I meet my friend for weekday lunches sometimes as it&#39;s halfway between our two companies. They have good lunch time specials and are such a cute little thai shop. I loveeee the name and all the super cute branding they have to go along with it! They sell adorable shirts!

In my latest order just last week, I had a huge miss. I&#39;ve gotten their pad thai before but it&#39;s been awhile so maybe they&#39;ve changed their recipe. I ordered the tofu pad thai and it was probably the worst pad thai I&#39;ve ever had. It tasted powdery for some reason and the tofu wasn&#39;t good either...which was weird because when is tofu not good? I&#39;m wondering what happened to this batch. All the noodles were stuck together in huge chunks and that powdery dry taste...maybe they didn&#39;t add fish oil? I don&#39;t know what happened but it was the worst ever. I had about 1/4 of it before I just couldn&#39;t do it anymore. I was very sad and now I don&#39;t think  I can risk getting the pad thai from Happy Elephant again.

Now the Lime Chicken...I don&#39;t know why I never got this before last week! I&#39;m obsessed and in love! I could see myself getting the lime chicken quite a lot. It reminds me of honey chicken from chinese restaurants but with a limey thai twist. This dish was on point in every single way and I can&#39;t see myself ordering from Happy Elephant ever again without this as one of the items. I&#39;m in love~~~~~

Happy Elephant is one of the few places in the area on GrubHub which is a huge plus! :D I&#39;m going to keep on trying new things at Happy Elephant but at this point I wouldn&#39;t recommend the pad thai to anyone! However, I highly recommend the lime chicken."

Sadly, pretty disappointed. To be fair I grew up eating a lot of traditional southeast asian foods (Vietnamese, Lao, Thai). But plenty of other thai joints I&#39;ve enjoyed.

Anyway, the lady and I shared a few items. First we had the Yum Yum salad. Something my dad would make a lot when I was little. It was ok - good flavor, but that cut of beef was really tough (probably a stew beef or something). On their menu it says that the beef is grilled. Maybe it&#39;s english second language but that was not grilled. Not that I care though, just pointing it out. Also had some Green Curry. Decent flavor. No complaints.

The sticky rice was a joke though. Mushy, clumpy, way too sticky and even brick-like in a few spots. I think they skipped an important step and just took it right out of the steamer and threw it into some plastic wrap. 

Maybe it was an off day for them. But I won&#39;t be ordering any food from them in the future."

We received a Happy Elephant flyer yesterday and wanted to give it a try. Thai food is generally something the family likes.

We ordered egg rolls, happy rolls, spring rolls, garlic beef, spicy basil beef, ginger rush shrimp for and pepper steak for delivery and not one dish was more than acceptable. 
The best of tonight&#39;s meal was the happy rolls. The spring rolls were cold chicken wrapped in a raw tortilla with carrots and cucumbers; gross. The egg rolls were nasty, undercooked and terribly priced small veggie rolls. This place isn&#39;t fooling me, they certainly we&#39;re not home made and you could definitely find the same exact pseudo &#34;egg rolls&#34; in the Jewel freezer aisle. Definitely not an egg roll. We actually had to call the restaurant back to make sure we received all of our order (we could not determine what the spring rolls were and thought they made a mistake). 

All of the dishes lacked flavor and were soupy  take out containers stuffed with a garden of vegetables. My dad had to add 3 different sauces to his basil beef so he could eat it; it was THAT bland. 
The ginger rush did not have the slightest taste of ginger in it and only had 6 small shrimp. $12 for 6 small shrimp, no ginger and some watery sauce? No way.  How are are charging $9+ per entree?  It should at least have a decent amount of meat. In fact... All of our dishes lacked meat (which was low quality anyway) and were overloaded with vegetables and watery sauce. Such a rip off!!! 
The pepper steak flavor was good, but loaded with way too many undercooked green peppers. 
The garlic lover beef was bland. 

Everything was terrible. I am so disappointed. $60 of our hard earned moolah down the drain and the worst Asian meal of our lives."

Had lunch here on a Thursday with my son.  Happy Elephant is a very small place, almost unnoticeable.  And, even when you enter it, it does not look like very much.   But, the food is good and inexpensive, and the service is wonderful.

They have a great lunch menu, primarily Thai with a few Chinese dishes mixed in.  With lunch you get soup, an appetizer and the meal itself.  We both had Massaman Curry with brown rice.  It was hot with loads of fresh, crisp vegetables, plenty of chicken and a wonderful sauce.  They offer several kinds of teas - I had a pot of oolong and Jon had jasmine tea.

But, the nicest thing was the service.  Our server came by our table and chatted.  Told us about the paintings.  When we told her how much we enjoyed the food, she told us that the next time we came in we should ask for certain dishes that were not listed on the menu and she would make them for us.

All in all, a wonderful experience."

Therefore, i bookmarked it! So when I was leaving my summer job and checked the nearby restaurants, I was super excited to see Happy Elephant was right down the street. 

I called a friend to meet me for lunch. I was super excited to see that they had a lunch special menu. I think it was $8. It came with a Thai veggie soup which had great flavor and your choice of an egg roll or cucumber salad. I had the cucumber salad which was a sweet and tangy dressing. 

For my meal, I ordered the Drunken Noodles with beef. My meal was delicious. The only issue I had was I mistook a jalapeño for a green pepper and ate it. My mouth was on fire, but that was my own fault. 

I was also thrilled that they had bubble yea with fresh fruit. You can combine different fruits to create a custom smoothie. I had a strawberry pineapple smoothie and it was very refreshing on a hot summer afternoon. 

The service here was fantastic. Super attentive and friendly. The owner came out to make sure we enjoyed out food. Be forewarned that the dining area is tiny and fills up quickly at lunch. That just shows how good the food is!"

The place is small, but it is always so clean and bright, it doesn&#39;t as small as it is. You know some those Thai joints are so scummy inside, that even if the food is good, it&#39;s creepy.

Happy Elelphant sparkles. And so does the service. I have eaten here at least ten times since finding it by accident one day. Every single time the service has been so friendly -- like I&#39;m a family relative. Often the lady there will just drop in something for free with my order. For no reason! And this was when I had only been there once or twice. 

They also deliver -- and are always on time and the food&#39;s always hot. Speaking of the food... YUM.

The first time was last year and the food was just OK. Certainly not the worst &#34;Thai&#34; food I&#39;ve ever had but there wasn&#39;t really any standouts and the portion sizes were rather small for the price.

Yesterday, having a craving for &#34;Thai&#34; takeout, I returned - big mistake. I have to say it was the single most underwhelming and overpriced meal I&#39;ve ever eaten.

The spring rolls weren&#39;t rolled anywhere near tight enough, so when you picked them up, all the filling just spilled out. Strangely, the cook had also decided to placed 5 slices of dessicated jalapeno slices on top, that had obviously been sliced hours (if not the day) before. The pot stickers were OK but they were strangely similar to frozen ones I&#39;ve bought at the supermarket before....

The Cashew Chicken was basically vegetable stir fry, with a couple of slices of chicken and a few cashews thrown in as an afterthought. There was no &#34;sauce&#34; to speak of. Instead, I received an oily broth that caused the otherwise crispy veggies to get soggy. My wife had the Garlic Chicken and it was the same way. The rice portion was basically a single SMALL scoop of rice thrown in an oversize styrofoam box. If I&#39;m paying close to $10 for an entree, the least the owner could do is &#34;splurge&#34; on giving enough cheap rice.

And for all that, we payed over $30! Ridiculous. I won&#39;t be going back and would warn others to stay away."

I&#39;m an avowed Meatatarian, but there are a select few foods that I get vegetarian since they&#39;re just better that way. One of them is Tofu Pad Thai, and one of my favs is Happy Elephant&#39;s (medium spicy).

Their Mango smoothies are top-shelf, right up there with my standard-bearer Coffee Haus (in Schaumburg). That said, I don&#39;t like whatever kind of tapioca balls they use, so I go bubble-less here.

Also delicious: their Raspberry Iced Tea (which they mix themselves), their Mango Sticky Rice and their Fillet of Sole.

We usually get carry-out, but their delivery great as well. Often the very friendly and happy proprietor himself delivers our grub.

I&#39;ve even perused the menu multiple times. But I hadn&#39;t gotten around to having their food until tonight. I stopped by on my way home from work and got an order of spring rolls, drunken noodles with tofu, and an iced coffee because a) it was hot out and b) it was half-off. (Good move there, Happy Elephant.)

Let&#39;s break this down:
One star for the deeelicious iced coffee. it was perfectly sweetened and strong without being bitter. 
One star for friendly and fast service -- I only sat about five minutes eyeing my surroundings (smallish dining room done in reds and golds) and enjoying my iced coffee.
One star for asking how hot I wanted my noodles and nailing it -- they were spicy without being &#34;Thai spicy&#34;, which my white-girl tongue can&#39;t handle.
One star for veggie-packed, tasty food that was clearly made with fresh ingredients.
Minus a star for the spring rolls. They were frankly disappointing -- not wrapped tightly enough, I ended up eating them with a fork. The filling was all right, but overall they were overpriced and just so-so.

I&#39;m glad I checked HE out -- it&#39;s a cute place and they seem to care about their customers and their food. Given the chance, I would try something else, but I have had better Thai ... though not in EGV :)"

I have never seen this dish appear to be swimming in a watery fluid before.  It is a drier dish and the noodles are typically pan fried.  This place seems to be more like a fast food restaurant.  The porion for $10 was disappointing as well.

I did rather like the Sriracha Shrimp appetizer, tho.  I would order that again.  The Happy Wraps were mostly dried white noodles."

All in all, the food was well prepared and you could tell that they use fresh ingredients.  We ordered 2 spring rolls, green curry with tofu, chicken peanut raman, veggie stir fry, Thai fried rice, spicy basil fried rice and 2 Thai custards.  Cost=$59
Everyone enjoyed their meals and commented how good it was.  Except for the green curry I found the entrees lacking in any kind of spice &#34;kick&#34;.  Both fried rice dishes were fluffy and not greasy at all as is the case with typical Chinese fried rice.  The veggie stir fry was in a light, flavorful sauce.  The Thai custard desserts were far too small.
I think we received good value for our buck and will return.  3.5 stars."

I&#39;ve loved everything I have tried, and I especially like their curries, noodles and happy wraps. Thai coffee is good, too. We order in all the time, and the owner delivers himself. It is also a great lunch spot, especially if you are in a hurry. 

The owners are super cool, and I personally adore the quirky waiter they employ. He does a great job, and he makes me laugh when he gets all stressed out over the 8 or 9 tables in the place.

The first time I came here, the food was excellent. My order was right, everything was cooked properly, and my pad woon sen was delicious and flavorful. The second time I came here, they forgot the tofu in my pad si ew, the carrots were practically raw and the broccoli was burned, and they apparently felt that &#34;hold the egg&#34; also meant &#34;hold the sauce.&#34; So disappointing!

The first time I came here, they gave me a free elephant sticker with my order. The second time I came here, they almost forgot to give me my receipt and change. 

The first time I came here, the staff was super friendly and answered the phone right away. The second time I came here, it rang about seven or eight times before anybody answered. The guy who gave me my food on arrival was friendly but seemed totally freaked out by the full dining room (maybe he should switch to decaf).

This is the only restaurant besides Hard Rock Cafe/Rainforest Cafe I have seen that has its own line of t-shirts. The logo is pretty adorable, and I love the colors. Having swag is a nice plus. Having tables so close together that nobody can get through the small dining room during the lunch rush is not. I think most customers would rather have a little R&amp;D put into the dining room before (admittedly completely awesome) elephant logo stuff.

Parking can also be very iffy. Once I was here and got a spot right away. On another occasion, I had to decide if I wanted to wait for somebody else to leave or park in a bagel shop&#39;s parking lot and walk over here. I also saw a heron in the parking lot on the first visit, but no such luck on the second visit, when the only wildlife I spotted was the invasive Parkus illegalus.

Also note that there is a minimum charge for delivery.

Maybe the difference is the time of day. My dinner visit was the 4-star visit, and my lunch visit was my 1.5 star visit (extra half star for friendliness and at least getting the mango and sticky rice right). I intend to look into the matter some more and report back with my findings. In the meantime, I&#39;d say skip Happy Elephant for lunch and try it for dinner instead."

We went here today after my 9 yr old son said that he wants to eat at Happy Elephant, so off we go for lunch with my daughter. Place is still packed for lunch. Always ordered Yum-yum salad (beef salad) which never fails.
My daughter got the chicken wings, not your typical American fare but she loves it. My son got the pot stickers and he was able to finish it on his own. 
I think dinner is better in this place...they have more on the menu especially lime chicken. 
The food today was not the typical food that I have expected...the pad thai noodles were &#39;clumpy&#39; but I will always go here for Thai food not unless I find something better somewhere else."

This place won&#39;t disappoint.  I admit objectively, I&#39;d rate the food&#39;s at 3 stars - average but solid food.  What sets it apart is that the couple that own the restaurant are so friendly and welcoming to everyone coming through their doors.  They&#39;ll come out to chat with you if they have time, and it&#39;s just got the feel of a neighborhood joint with a lot of regulars.  Even though it&#39;s in a small strip mall next to a laundromat, it&#39;s very tastefully decorated inside in beautiful colors, feeling somewhat hip and urban.

Most dishes we&#39;ve had was very good - the Penang Chicken&#39;s my fav.  The only item I had issue with once was the shrimp in our takeout pineapple fried rice, which smelled really strong, but that&#39;s just a one-time thing since all the other times it&#39;s been fine.  They&#39;re very accommodating with substitutions or any other preferences you may have.  The owner chef is Thai, and brings her spin to some of the dishes.

Definitely recommended as a friendly neighborhood joint for solid food."

It&#39;s kind of our go-to place when we have people over.  Everyone loves it or they&#39;re being super courteous.  

I love their Pad Thai.  It&#39;s steamy and fresh.  You can tell it&#39;s home made b/c it does not have that orange or pink tint to it.  The Drunken Noodles are excellent as well.  They are the wide, rice noodles with hints of basil and jasmine.  The basil fried rice is cooked to perfection.  You can tell that they&#39;re not cooking out of large plastic containers.  Everything is pretty much made to order.  

Background:  The Happy Elephant moved into a noodle place that I drove by 100 times, but never walked into.  The outside used to look dirty (and mean).  Anyway, those days are over, so out with the old and in with the new.  The new place is super clean, colorful, with creative Zen-like art on the walls and did I say brand spankin&#39; new.    The ambiance is definitely not fancy, but it&#39;s fresh; which I prefer.   It reminds me of a place you would find in New York or Chicago b/c it&#39;s totally unpretentious, mom and pop, but with a much younger vibe.  

If you like Big Bowl, drive the 4 miles south and check this place out.  It&#39;s in the same strip mall as Teddy&#39;s diner.  

I didn&#39;t want to go here, but I&#39;m going to.  As far as Mary K&#39;s 1-star review of the Happy Elephant, I can say this:  I have 168 reviews under my belt and at this time you have 2, so .....#@$#$%%$^%$%$!!!!!!!.........and you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about anyway.

My brother and his girlfriend loves this place so my boyfriend &amp; I decided to give it a shot.

Food was great.  The moment we sat down, we were given soup - as I guessed was part of the lunch special.  I guess for lunch, they only give you the lunch special menu and not the thorough, complete menu.  Oh well.  It comes with your choice of eggroll or cucumber salad; I got the salad, which had this sweet, tangy zing to it that I liked a lot :) then for the entree I got their infamous lime chicken (probably the best decision I made! It was delicious!)

I knocked off a star because service wasn&#39;t up to par.  We ordered the Thai Sunrise (a drink) or something named like that, and the restaurant, being such a small place, we could hear our orders being yelled out... Now the drink may be too tedious to create, but we don&#39;t wanna hear: &#34;Two Thai Sunrises... No I&#39;m not kidding, I don&#39;t joke when it comes to that stuff.&#34;  Like is it really that bad to make the drink?? As a customer and a previous employee of the food and beverage industry, I didn&#39;t want to hear that.  Another thing, my boyfriend was offered water (to which he declined), but for some reason, I drank my drink almost down to its last ice and the server didn&#39;t even bother to ask ME if I wanted water. Other than that, I wouldn&#39;t really put this place under the guillotine - it&#39;s still pretty amazing food.  The employees would just have to watch what they say sometimes, since the tables are literally less than 3-5 feet away from the counter/server area/kitchen area."

The nice surprise was that the chef/owner came out with a free dessert for my birthday after our meal.  That was very sweet of her.

I would go back again during my lunch break when craving Thai.

I would have given them a 5 star review if it weren&#39;t for their not so enthusiactic waiter.  He let us know he was having a bad day, which clearly showed and he wasn&#39;t knowlegable on the dishes and had to ask the other owner a few times about how a few dishes were prepared."

The dining area is on the smaller side but the awesome service makes up for it.  

For the dishes:

The Thai Veggie soup was ok - my 5 yr old said it tasted just like chicken noodle without the noodles. 

Crab Rangoon - the little triangles were much smaller then I&#39;m used to but they do pack a punch of flavor. You can actually taste the different veggies / crab (not just cream cheese).

Red curry - Good mixture of veggies and beef. I thought the eggplant pieces should be a little bigger. The dish did have a good balance between sweet &amp; hot. 

Beef and Broccoli - This dish was just ok. The beef, broccoli and carrots were fresh and tasty but this dish lacked any special kick to it. The brown sauce has a soy base but not much flavor other then the soy. 

Coconut Ice cream - Who doesn&#39;t love it? Its not made fresh there but a delicious treat to finish off the lunch experience. 

Overall, a good cheap Thai restaurant in the nw burbs."

Like most people, I take my Thai food seriously. I have no qualms with this place being in a dinky strip mall, as many of the best Thai Food purveyors hide in them, but I do take issue with the food. I got my usual dish at any Thai Food haven, Spicy Basil with tofu... and make it extra spicy. Sadly, it was not spicy at all and wasn&#39;t all that great. It reminded me of the time I tried to make Thai food myself and it just tasted like a rice, water, and frozen veggie mix. No real flavor, absolutely no spice, and not up to par for me. The Tom Yum soup was also a disappointment. The portion size on the soup was good but again, lacking in flavor; I need more lemongrass.

My boyfriend got the green curry with tofu and totally lucked out with LOTS of spice... but not like it was hot, just like it may have been over spiced- still better than my bland food. I was so sad because the service was fantastic, the decor is uber cute, and I totally want a t-shirt with their logo on it but it just wasn&#39;t all that I thought it would be. 

The owner did come around partially through our meal to check on us and was very nice, but I didn&#39;t mention that my food was virtually tasteless. I know, I know- that&#39;s my fault, but we were in a hurry to make it to a Flaming Lips show and I didn&#39;t want to waste any more time fixing it to be better. 

If I have to be totally honest, I&#39;d give the food a 2 but the decor and service a 4.8. In defense of Happy Elephant, I think we just had an off meal because one guy eating there ordered 2 meals and then applied for a job... I&#39;d maybe give it another try if I were in the area."

While I am quite adventurous with my food choices my mother is not. No spice and as plain jane as it get for her so I was a little cautious coming here.

Needless to say I am so glad that we came here. The place is super small to eat in but they are super friendly and it is especially great to have the chef (owner?) come around and see how everything was.

The thai veg soup was very hot and perfect for a cold day. I cant put my finger on it but it might have been white pepper that gave it some heat. Im probably way off but for how clear it was it packed so much flavor. If anyone can find out how they make please let me know their secret!

The egg roll was fresh and perfectly seasoned. Im a sucker for fried food so this passes with flying colors. Nice sweet and sour dipping sauce on the table too.

I got the drunken noodles which were amazing. It seems all too often when the chow fun noodle (flat wide rice noodle) is used they get burnt in the wok or over cooked to much. This was the first time in a long time that they were cooked perfectly. I love spicy food and this could have used some more for my taste so next time I ask for spicy. Overall very flavorful and lots to eat too.

The second dish that we ordered was the golden noodles. We both ordered our dishes with bbq pork and it was good match for mine but i think that the golden noodles would have been better with chicken or maybe shrimp. It was a little more basic is flavor but still very good. The eggs made the dish and it was something that I wouldn&#39;t have thought to pair.

Basically if you like thai food get over here asap. The menu is large and I will be going back soon to try more things out. Lets see how spicy they can make it though...."

Crab Rangoon was absolutely delicious and the Sweet &amp; Sour sauce was simply amazing.  A must try!!!

The Spicy Basil Chicken did not disappoint.  The vegetables and the chicken tasted fresh.  I enjoyed it very much.

The Tofu Pad Thai was also made with fresh vegetables and was very tasty as well.

We had the spring rolls that were wrapped in what looked like a tortilla of some sort...not rice paper and they were cut into bite size pieces. The dipping sauce was good but you had to smother the &#34;rolls&#34; to eat. Then we had a chicken wrap which was all rice, some chicken and a 1/8 teaspoon of peanut sauce. I had to use the spring roll dipping sauce to make it edible. The beef and broccoli should have been called &#34;find the beef in this broccoli&#34; and it was bland.

It&#39;s a very small restaurant and the tables are tiny Between the dishes of food, drinks and bottle of hot sauce and sweet and sour sauce, things on the table got a little precarious. But the service and the food was wonderful so I can overlook that, or else order takeout next time. 

We had the lunch specials--for about $10 you get a small cup of vegetable soup, choice of an egg roll or cucumber salad, and choice of entree with white rice. The soup was good--a peppery flavor and a lot of little bits of celery, carrots, and cabbage. The egg roll was good--nice crunch and very fresh--not to greasy either. I chose the Spicy Basil with chicken. Very good mixture of chicken, basil leaves, mushrooms, baby corn, bell peppers and bamboo shoots. The menu noted that it was spicy. It had a good flavor, but I didn&#39;t find the dish spicy at all. The house sweet chili sauce I added gave the dish the heat I wanted and it was a pretty good tasting sauce as well. Hubsbie had the green curry with chicken--I got to sample a few bites and I liked his dish much better than mine. It had a good amount of heat to it and a peanuty/curry flavor. 

On the smoothie/bubble drink note note, I must say I cannot find ANY bubble smoothie places in this neck of the suburbs so I was very excited to see it on the menu and hoped it would be good. My mango smoothie was OK--I&#39;ve had better. My favorite is still that &#34;joyous&#34; place, but HE&#39;s bubble drinks will be good in a pinch when I&#39;m having a craving and not willing to drive very far."

Cute cozy and the owner was there to welcome us, he told us he was giving us his best server SAM and he was correct, she was great. My husband had me google the best place to get a steak, that&#39;s all he wanted was a steak. We ordered and when Sam brought them she asked us each to cut into them and make sure it was ok everyone&#39;s was perfect except my husbands and he asked for it to be cooked a little more. She took it to the cook  and he he made a very loud comment &#34;Are you kidding me &#34; awkward because we were at the table right in front. By the time we got it back my husband was so uncomfortable he did not eat.
Sam took the steak off our menu but the owner never approached our table. When we left the cook gave us a very uncomfortable watch out the door!
Really a shame but when I go out to eat I want to feet comfortable.
Sorry I cannot recommend this place"

The burger is a good quality generous half pound restaurant burger; however, it is not in the category of a gourmet burger such as what is available, at Kuma&#39;s, Burger Local, or the DMK Burger Bar. They do nickel and dime you for the toppings, but it is still a good deal and if you like a plain burger then it is even a better value. I was surprised someone was so impressed with the French Onion soup. It is good but certainly not class leading. Even though it is a little dark, the modern trendy décor is appreciated."

It delivers every time and is really well run. Every single time I have been there a manager or who i assume to be the owner will come up to our table and ask us how our evening was. It has a very cool vibe inside as well with exposed brick and a visible kitchen. Something you really don&#39;t see in other restaurants. Great wrap around bar too if you need to wait for a table.

Two favorite appetizers are the Asian Calamari and the baked goat cheese. The calamari has a really great sweet and sour sauce on it which really makes it different from calamari you would get at another restaurant. 

My three favorite entrees on there menu would have to be the Napa Valley Chicken which comes with a great white wine creme sauce.  The Scallops are some of the best ive had with a great roasted red pepper risotto. Also you can never go wrong with a steak either here which can have special toppings added. 

Cant go wrong with a burger or salad either. 

Overall great place to go for a casual dinner or for a bottle of wine and a great meal."

The owners have always been so professional and nice, the steaks have been great and, as someone with Celiac, there are few places to eat in the area. Unfortunately, we just literally can not go back until things change.

Foxfire has always been one of the most expensive restaurants in the area. Just recently, however, they changed their menu, adding options and making once included side items a la carte. The potato that used to come with a $49 steak order is now $6-$8 extra.

I opted to get a risotto I&#39;ve had many times before, but something is definitely different around there. This risotto came out lukewarm and completely lacking flavor with cold, plain cocktail shrimp on top of it. It was uneatable, just gross.

As a long-time and loyal customer, I wrote the owners trying to have an honest dialogue about the changes. I received no response. Just disappointing."

The big paw on the fox clock is pointing at &#34;NO&#34;.

OK - to be absolutely fair - ordering a half rack of ribs at an upscale eatery in an upscale area might seem incorrect.  But I LIKE ribs.  I was in the MOOD for ribs.  And...if they cook even halfway decently...they should be able able to serve an upscale plate at their decidedly upscale prices regardless of what the customer orders.  

The ribs were, in a word; awful.  

Not a hint of smoke, lukewarm, and - quite frankly - seemed like they had done a few laps around the block.  The sauce was sweet and thick, and did nothing to hide the awfulness of the meat underneath.  I have had FAR better at franchise restaurants for far less money.  Even the rolls served with the meal tasted suspiciously like the the ones your mom used to buy in a supermarket 12-pack and heat in the oven just before serving Sunday dinner.

At these prices, there are far better choices in the area.

What does the fox say?

Once we were sat someone came over and cleared the extra plates, silverware and glasses and another person came and filled our water glasses. Our server Miguel greeted us within 5 minutes of being sat down, took our drink orders and once he came back we were ready to order. I had a couple questions about the menu which he was able to answer no problem! Now for the order, I had the ribeye with parmesan crust and chose to add on their garden salad, my boyfriend got their napa chicken dish and added on their 1/2 mozzarella salad. We got a side of grilled asparagus and au gratin potatoes to share. The garden salad was OK exactly what youd expect and my boyfriend absolutely loved their mozzarella salad(caprese). Ribeye was cooked to perfection and the chicken dish was wonderful and had an out of this world white wine cream sauce! The au gratin potatoes were the best I have ever had...sorry grandma! During our meal three gentleman stopped by our booth to check on us and see how we were enjoying everything, one was our server and I believe one of the other gentleman was the owner and the other their head chef! It feels wonderful when you are approached and asked how your evening is going, if youre loving the food, and I particularly like that Miguel asked us what brought us out tonight and trying to get a hint if we were celebrating anything special. On our way out we were very warmly wished a good night by several staff and I almost forgot my to-go(how could I!?) and the man who I believe is their head chef noticed and saved me from leaving behind a wonderful piece of meat I planned to heat up and devour later on! This place has a great atmosphere with live music and is simply decorated as the restaurant is beautiful by itself with exposed brick walls a cathedral style ceiling with wooden beams. I would go back in a heartbeat, I truly have no complaints about this place!"

I&#39;ve been going here for about 8 years and have always had a tasty meal. I took my girlfriend there tonight and was shocked to see that they significantly changed their menu and more importantly, made it so that all sides and salads are ala carte. I&#39;ve always felt that Foxfire got penalized (on Yelp) for having slightly higher prices than similar places in the area. I gave them the 5 star review 4 months ago because I wanted to acknowledge that while their prices are a bit higher, they&#39;re food is always on point. Well, after seeing that they removed many of our favorite meals from their menu, they are now charging six dollars for a side and eight dollars for a dinner salad. I ordered a filet ($33) and my girlfriend ordered a new chicken dish (25ish dollars and the only chicken meal on the menu now). We both had one glass of wine and we split a side. That&#39;s it. The bill was about a hundred dollars before tip. Our waitress was fine (staff has always been good) but the cost to get a full meal there is just too much for the area. I will say that the steak was good, they upgraded the quality of their steaks without charging more (which is good considering you were already paying 33 dollars for a 6oz filet). Overall, I was bummed out the whole time I was there, knowing that would be my last time going there after many years of enjoying their food. I&#39;m not sure if they weren&#39;t doing well financially, but this was a very bad move. It was pretty empty for a Saturday night, so in guessing I&#39;m not the only one that feels this way."

Sat for about 10 minutes before a server came by and then it took a while for our drinks to come - martini and beer.   I ordered the french onion soup - it was good, but it could have been hotter, i have a feeling the waiter didn&#39;t pick it up right away.  It wasn&#39;t that busy, so I&#39;m not sure why service was so slow.  I ordered a beef tenderloin special - each 3 oz piece had a different crust, one blue cheese, one peppercorn, one horseradish - they were all very tasty, good piece of meat however my steaks were cooked to medium when I ordered them cooked to medium rare.  my husband had the steak salad - the salad was fine, but don&#39;t expect much steak, they were puny skewers that, because they were so small, were also over cooked.   

bread basket was delicious and hot.  overall, wasn&#39;t the perfect dining experience, but a good value / price for quality.  will definitely go back and try again!"

I love Foxfire but I was a little disappointed with this visit.  My entree was scallops with red pepper risotto. I have had this entree twice before, and I think my luck ran out with #3.  The scallops were inconsistent, half of them were tender and terrific, the others were chewy, almost like calamari.  They do serve a large portion, so I was fine with leaving a couple on the plate.   The risotto was, as usual, unbelievably good.  Could be the best side I have ever had, anywhere.  So what was the problem?   The portion size was about half what it should have been for this entree.  The scallops are arranged around the risotto and the presentation was pretty bad.  I&#39;m surprised they served it at all, perhaps they ran out?   Fortunately, my daughter have the same side with her entree and couldn&#39;t eat half of the portion served to her, so I ended up with a decent amount.  Must mention that my wife and kids enjoyed their meals, and my son and I each had a bowl of their marvelous French onion soup, just exceptional. 

I&#39;ll leave with my recommendation as very good, but I will probably pass on the scallops next time."

I went here for my boyfriend&#39;s 21st birthday with some friends. We went on a day when there was a burger deal so we could avoid their ridiculous prices. 

First off, it took about 20-30 minutes to get our drinks. The server had no empathy, thought was doing a great job. She was terrible. After we finally got our drinks, she left for another 20-30 minutes. This was the patten for the entire evening. The server never once apologized for her terrible service. 

The food was mediocre at best. Everyone got burgers. Nothing to write home about. 

We eventually gave up on ordering drinks because that was too complicated of a task for the server. We ate quickly so we could get out of there but of course when we wanted to pay, the server was no where to be found. When we finally got the checks, she charged us incorrectly so we had to wait for her to grace us with her presence once again.

Waitress was friendly, on the ball and kept us moving at whatever pace we wanted to dictate.  We dawdled through drinks and apps and then sipped some wine and then kicked into gear when it was time to wrap it up.  She had no problems shifting gears right along with us and I truly appreciate that.

I had a shrimp de jonghe app that might have been the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The shrimp were of good size, and the whole thing was done perfectly with not too much garlic and what I think was parmesan or pecorino cheese, which is a nice touch.  I&#39;ve been back since for drinks/happy hour just to hammer down one of these delectable treats.  If it was a larger portion on the dinner menu I&#39;d order it.  (consider that a submission to your suggestion box, Foxfire)

My other point of interest was the wine.  The wine list is decent for a semi-casual place.  You can find a decent bottle here.  Thing is, we&#39;re kind of winos, so when we blow the roof off for a birthday or something we like amazing 93+ point wines that are sitting in their prime drinking window.  In fact those special occasions are why we buy the really good stuff in the first place and stick it in the cellar for &#39;someday&#39;.  Not having that option takes something away from special occasion dinners for us to the point where we have at times decided to cook at home with a top tier bottle(s) rather than go out.  Foxfire does not go that far with their wine list, and I imagine there just isn&#39;t enough demand to justify stocking all of that expensive grape, BUT their corkage fee is nominal, like 15 bucks or something, so next time we&#39;ll cart our own in and have the best of both worlds.  This really is a nice amenity.  15 bucks to pop and pour a reallly nice bottle out at a restaurant while they do the rest of the cooking?  That&#39;s an attractant for us right there.

Why 4 instead of 5?  Well, it is maybe a bit overcasual for the price point, with the dining area directly adjacent to the bar, so I found myself kind of on the fence about that aspect, but the food was really good, as was the service, and we liked it well enough that we&#39;ll be going back."

From the dinner rolls upon arrival to the filet mignon to the ahi tuna (and I don&#39;t usually enjoy seafood of any kind) to the Fox Fire Ale on tap (some of the most refreshing local brew I&#39;ve had) to the star of the show -- the Angus Burger -- Fox Fire&#39;s entrees never disappoint. The dessert menu is rather small and I have been underwhelmed more than wowed; but, for your own sake, if you have ever thought you remotely enjoyed a cheeseburger, then you owe it to yourself to grab an Angus Burger. If you&#39;re on a budget, book a reservation on Monday night when the $10 burger goes to $5. There is ZERO dip in quality, I assure you. You can thank me later.

P.S. Their buss staff is one of the most efficient and friendly that I have ever witnessed. The owner/proprietor always makes a point of being on the floor and engages us before we pay or exit each and every time we dine here. More businesses could stand to take a lesson from this man, his gregariousness, and his overall business acumen.

1) Our meal was superb!  I had the FoxFire Filet Medallions; the unique berry sauce was delicious, filet was cooked nicely, flavor was spot on.  Husband ordered prime rib and it was one of the best I&#39;ve tasted.  So tender and deliciously seasoned.  
2) I appreciate that the meal comes with bread and soup or salad and a side.  The bread was warm and amazingly soft.  So yummy! And filling!  Finally, a nice restaurant where not everything is ala carte.
3) The building is unique and beautiful.
4) The gentleman, who I assume is the manager, walked around and checked on all the tables to be sure everything was going well.  He stopped by ours twice in the time we were there.  
5) The wait staff was on their game; we never had to ask for a refill.

The only semi-downside was that we were seated in an obvious less than desirable table.  By the kitchen and by a side &#34;filling&#34; station.  We did make reservations but it was our first visit.  Having worked in a nice restaurant before, I assume if you&#39;re frequent customers, the better your table.  
Our waitress, while she started off friendly, became much less engaged and chipper when we opted not to order drinks or appetizers.  After having the meal, I know FOR SURE we could not have finished our meals if we had an appetizer on top of it since the entrees are solid portions as mentioned above."

Server was nice but be prepared if he or she offers anything (specifically the sauce that goes on your steak) it&#39;s $4 extra. Didn&#39;t like getting &#34;nickeled and dimed&#34; on a $72 meal.  Don&#39;t mind paying $72 if the meal is good. However this one was subpar. 

So many better places to eat in Geneva."

Never had a prime 38.00 new York strip and would have to put a seasoned crust on it to give it flavor. We came in dinner for four. And ordered my steak medium .with risotto.  The steak came out below rare. The risotto was perfect.  Sent the steak back by the time they brought it back the whole table was done with dinner and was ordering desert.  At that point I just asked to wrap it to go. Definitely disappointed. Most highline restaurants would at least comp the desert we spent over 300.00 on dinner for four, and my 40.00 steak went home in a box.  Never going back."

I had requested a  &#34;nice&#34; table and despite its nearness to the fireplace, which provided no warmth to us, it also was near the back door which opened frequently and blasted us with cold air.

However, the rolls were some of the best I have ever had, and everyone proclaimed their entrée to be absolutely delicious.  That included salmon, prime rib, filet, and tilapia.  Dessert was tasty, too: white chocolate raspberry cheesecake.

It was on the loud side and very difficult to hear the person across the table from you.  They have a party room and that was in use and even with the doors closed we did hear  &#34;Happy Birthday&#34;  LOUD AND CLEAR.

The bar is in the front and on the left as you enter and the hostess stand is in the middle of the restaurant, just a little heads up.  The kitchen is next to the bar which means the tables are along one side of the wall.  That continues to the back, but there are a few tables on the other wall in the back and a couple of tables along the passageway to the back door.

Server was friendly and attentive but water refills needed to be requested."

AbSolutely no complaints about the appetizer (goat cheese - smooth and spicy) or the dinner (NY Strip for the Hubby and Filet for me).  Both were absolutely delicious.  Enough food for three and wonderfully spiced. 
My only two complAints were about the dessert of creme brulee wHich was very bland and cold and watching the manager (owner? ) rub the shoulders of a staff member.  It&#39;s completely open - no pRivate wait stations- and when i happened to look over and see the 60 something year old manager rubbing the shoulders of a 20 something server -- it&#39;s the definition of harassment.

This was our first visit and we happened on your restaurant by chance.  My husband and I were out for a beautiful convertible weather drive and he was looking for a new dinner location on &#34;Open Table&#34; and your location had great reviews so we thought we&#39;d try.  The restaurant impressed us as we walked in with the set up and decor, your host was so friendly and pleasant.....service was so welcoming and attentive....the gentleman bringing the water even asked if we were enjoying our meal....great staff!  I am assuming the gentleman that came around to the table to ask if we like our meal was the owner?  He was such a nice and friendly man we appreciated him checking in on us.  Oh wait, I didn&#39;t even talk about the food!  Spectacular!!!  I had Prime Rib and it was perfect.....my husband loved his Steak Salad....we had &#34;Lunatic&#34;  wine and it&#39;s a new favorite now!  Thank you for all of the hard work....it sure pays off.

Good-sized portions.  But WAY overpriced given the quality of the food.  Crab cake appetizer was good, but very salty.  Ordered the &#34;house specialty&#34; pork chop meal - my first bite of pork chop nearly burnt my tongue.  It was so hot and overcooked, and only continued to get worse as it cooked itself even more on my plate. Asparagus was overcooked and mushy, too.  I rarely complain, but when a manager came over to check on us, i had to mention the rock-hard pork chop.  He apologized and said the grill was probably &#34;too hot.&#34;  What?  10 minutes or more later, another full meal arrived.  This one was now rare to medium-rare (the original request was medium).  Asparagus was done properly on the second attempt.

Meanwhile, my daughter&#39;s child meal of potatoes and mac/cheese was okay.  Maybe it&#39;s best to order from the kid&#39;s menu here."

Our server brought everyone&#39;s soup but mine and when I reminded her about it she brought the wrong soup...ugh! I then asked our table of eight if I had failed to mention it when ordering or she forgot. They confirmed, she forgot. Maybe she should try writing down the orders the next time she has a large table.

Then i received my entree (Salmon) and it was the smallest piece of fish I&#39;d ever seen. Way overcooked and downright awful tasting. Luckily I had some snacks back at my hotel room.

I went here on a date with my wife recently. The decor, ambience and atmosphere were wonderful! Really a spectacular interior and very cool, exposed, trendy kitchen. We were dressed up, ready to fork over $100+ for two, so my expectations were high. The waiter was decent but definitely could have checked on us more often. I still tipped him well. He was friendly and helpful when he did show up. We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer. They were not that great. Not bad, but NOTHING to write home about. I&#39;ve had better crab cakes at very casual seafood joints. My wife got shrimp scampi and she said it was good and I got the FoxFire medallions w/ Garlic Mashed Potatoes. The mashed potatoes = same story as the crab cakes. Not that great. Not bad. Not good. Was expecting much, much better though. The steak... was AMAZING. Cooked perfectly medium-rare. Absolutely spectacular steak. The demi-glaze, bleu cheese and cranberry style was unique, original and perfectly executed. Besides the lackluster sides and apps, this place is DEFINITELY the go-to steak spot in the Geneva area, no question about that. I will be back! GET THE MEDALLIONS!"

The steaks we ordered were supposed to be medium (pinkish in the middle) The order came in and the meat was practically raw.
The prime rib apparently was boiled, it looked like it too. When asked to cook it a little  more as I was expecting and raw was out of the question, it came in the same maybe warmer.
Waste of $100."

We have come before and really enjoyed the food, however tonight was really quite bad. Our waitress, I believe her name was Sam, was erratic, inconsistent and seemed completely unfocused on her job. She also whined and complained loudly about everyone and everything right in front of the whole restaurant. While eating all we could hear was her complaining about how she has been scheduled and that people there still view her as a rookie. In her own words she said she would rather they just fire her if they will always treat her like a rookie. Now her complaints might be totally valid-I don&#39;t know. But I certainly didn&#39;t need to hear her talking about them to her coworkers for my whole meal. 

My soup was amazing, as always. There is no better French onion soup around! My boyfriend also enjoyed his soup of the day. His steak was excellent. 

However, my dish, the frutti di mare was really just awful. It&#39;s a fairly basic dish and this place is steak and seafood so I don&#39;t understand how it could be so badly done. The sauce was flavorless and acidic. Like a can of plain tomato sauce. The mussels were atrocious - they actually felt and tasted like powder. The scallops could&#39;ve been chicken they were so tough and dry. In my opinion, it&#39;s a sin against the entirety of seafood to overcook scallops like that. In addition, the temperature of my dish was all over the place. Some pieces of calamari were ice cold. Some pieces of shrimp were so hot they burned my mouth. After mixing the insanely hot with the very cold my whole dish was basically lukewarm. Extremely disappointing for a birthday dinner. 

Didn&#39;t even get a chance to finish my wine and pick at the noodles before our waitress came and boxes up my pasta even though my boyfriend was only halfway through his steak and I had plenty of mediocre food left. Big party at the back got all the staffs attention and we left displeased. Not sure what to do with all this leftover pasta in my fridge now..."

The service was okay, a very nice server, but way too slow bringing out the drinks. The salad was so cold you had to let it warm up to be able to eat it. The shrimp salad was good, but nothing special. The chicken marsala was one of the worst I&#39;ve ever had, considering it was a house specialty I was even more disappointed. Other members of the party ate less than a quarter of their dishes stating they were inedible. I didn&#39;t taste them myself but trust their word. And then the bill came........yowza! I don&#39;t mind paying a lot for a good meal, but I do mind paying a huge bill for a very mediocre meal.

The bottom line for me is that the food is way overrated, there are much better offerings in Geneva."

Atmosphere: it was actually really nice. It wasn&#39;t congested or overly loud. The place was clean and had space so you didn&#39;t feel crowded. It has a nice warm cozy feel about it. 

Service: the host was really nice a mid aged young gentleman with glasses on was friendly and seated us immediately we came in for a late lunch/early dinner. 

Our waitress was on the verge of being really bored of working and slightly annoyed with us.  When I state annoyed with us I mean when we asked questions related to the menu she seemed annoyed that we were even asking.  When we also asked to see the dessert menu she literally tossed/threw it on the table. Overall I think she was rude and she does not need to be in a job where she deals with people. She also rarely came back to the point we were always grabbing another waitress or yelling across the restaurant to get her attention which I am sure annoyed other diners (which was slightly embarrassing). 

Food: Ok I think I may have just ordered the wrong things but one thing I would recommend you do NOT order is the salmon salad. The lettuce was disgusting and close to mushy and the salmon has the wrong taste it wasn&#39;t rancid but overcooked and it did not taste fresh. 

I had the cauliflower soup and it was supposed to be a cream of soup it was runny and watered down with little flavour. Dessert was just kind of frozen tasting-like frozen chocolate cake. 

What my friend ordered was really delicious looking and she stated it was really good. And the other food from other tables I saw flying by looked very delicious I think I just ordered all the wrong things :(. 

I gave it three stars because the service by our excuse for a server was piss poor at best and because all 3 items that I personally ordered were ok to fair.To be fair I think I will come back on a different day and try again and see if maybe they were just having an off day. I really hope they were as I kind of really liked the atmosphere of this place. 

We went on a Saturday and like many other posters the restaurant does get busy around the 530-600 hour as we were leaving...maybe their service gets better as well."

Our experience started of well with a very tasty appetizer, the Beef Brochette, and I had their house beer which reminded me of a Killians Irish Red. Their soup of the day, chicken tortilla, was good too but really the thing that fell short, unfortunately, was the main course. While my steak was pretty good (the blue cheese crust was a little overpowering but I can&#39;t really complain about a blue cheese crust being to blue cheesy) but my fiance&#39;s chicken Alfredo was very under seasoned (reheating it at home with a good dose of salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese produced a better outcome even thought it was reheated pasta). The white chocolate cheesecake for dessert helped soften the disappointment of the main course. 

While the meal began and ended well, falling short on the most important (and most expensive) part of the meal is cause for a couple lost stars."

Our server was actually bad, because she did not follow through with promises. If you say you will get more bread, do not make us ask for more 10 minutes later. If every one has empty water glasses at the start of the meal; do not ask if any one needs water refills. Service rated 1 star on this visit.

Most of the food we had was mediocre, or downright awful.

Appetizers - shrimp cocktail was ok
                    mussels were awful. Overcooked, too small, and a waste of money.
                    the sauce the mussels came in was outstanding, and we ate it on
                     the bread as a makeshift appetizer. This was when we were brought
                     bread refills

Entrees - Signature rib dinners were not so special. Dry, overcooked ribs, with a 
                peculiar bbq sauce poured on top. Presentation was poor.
                Cajun ribeye sandwich had no flavor and the meat was tough. Cajun
                to me means spicy. Not here.
                French onion soup had the perfect mix of bread and cheese. It is
                unfortunate, however, because the soup was so salty it was inedible.
                The au gratin potatoes, which I loved before, tasted like fish. Something
                was definitely off this evening. 

When a restaurant charges high end prices, say 30 to 40 dollars for entrees, one expects attentive service as well as a high level of quality of the food.

Sadly, we received poor food, with even worse service. There are better alternatives in the tri cities that we will exhaust before we return here. This restaurant seems to be resting on its past reputation. No effort seemed to be made to create a superior dish, properly cooked, seasoned, and presented. The sandwich was actually served on a plate, with zero garnishments. It takes effort to keep a good restaurant running well, and we did not see much effort being exerted."

We walked in, excited for a good dinner, and were greeted by one of the least personable and service-oriented hostesses I have encountered in my entire life. 

That left me with a sour taste in my mouth to start the day, but I left feeling fantastic, so that tells you something about how awesome this place is. Our waitress was kind, courteous, and helpful (pressing us to order just moments before the party of 30 was perhaps the most helpful thing a waitress has ever done in my experience). 

The atmosphere is what you might expect at a relatively pricy steak house. You get the feeling of being high class, but not without being accessible. It&#39;s a surprisingly urban spot in the far outskirts of the suburbs. 

As far as the food goes, I&#39;ve usually only had burgers and steaks here, which are -- understandably -- delicious. Last night I decided to branch out and try a a Cajun tuna which was almost certainly the best tuna I&#39;ve had in my life. Add to that a delicious French Onion soup and a baked goat cheese appetizer, and we had a meal that left me as satisfied as I was after hitting some of the finer establishments in Charleston, SC (a place a bit more renowned for great food than my birthplace in the west suburbs)."

Our reservation was for 730, and although the restaurant was quite busy, we were seated immediately. We went with two other couples, neither of whom had dined here before either. 

Other than my fiancé ordering prime rib, only to find out that they were out, the entire experience was very good. We ordered calamari and stuffed mushrooms which were excellent in taste but a little skimpy on portion size. Our meals, however, were all around excellent. I had the tilapia, which was seasoned very well and was moist. The meal came with soup or salad as well. I ordered the French onion soup and it was very tasty. Most of us ended up bringing home leftovers because the meals were large in size. The service was good as well.

We will certainly make another trip back!"

We had five in our dinner party all ordering from the dinner menu and everyone was pleased with their entrées which included the prime rib, filet, and the special of the day which was salmon. The appetizer to go for is the goat cheese. 

The wine list really needs some work, the selections are extremely limited. Scotch and other liquors, there is a better selection.

Our server Audra was amazing, my brother and I both know what we like in food and despite our boisterous nature she was right there with us.  Recommended for a special occasion."

Our reservation was for 8:30, so we showed up at 7:00, put our name in, and waited the 40 minutes until our seating across the street at a bar.  Perfect.

The steak was perfection.  Really.  I asked for medium/medium well, and with a confused look, my waitor made it happen.  Thanks waitor!  This is excellence on a plate!  My sweet potato even came with the special whipped butter and brown sugar on the side-- that&#39;s the way to do it.

The bf&#39;s porkchop was also excellent, but not gonna lie, he was a little jealous of my filet mignon.

The bus boys were very attentive, our waitor was a little busy, and I would ask for the crab cakes to be a little more crispy on the outside.  But, our experience was great.  And, they let us sit there as long as we wanted, with no pressure.  

I appreciate it, Foxfire.  Thanks.  And thanks to groupon, for letting us know about this place in the first place!"

We arrived around 5pm on a Saturday.  Walked right up and were seated immediately.  It looks like the sweet spot is before 6:30 because as we were leaving there was the beginnings of a wait.

We started with the Fox Fire Red Ale.  Who knew they had they own brew?  Ours was excellent!  A nice compliment to our crab cake appetizer which also was good.

My wife had the Salmon Alfredo which she thoroughly enjoyed although it had a few too many noodles compared to the other ingredients.

I usually try a filet mignon when ever I&#39;m at a steak place.  This time I tried the Filet Oscar.  I loved it.  the asparagus bed was crisp the filet was juicy and cooked to a pefect medium.  It was all topped with a creamy sauce and a crab cake.

The service too was attentive.  Even though they were getting busy near the end of our stay, our waitress was still attentive and yet not too pushy for us to clear the table.

The only reason this is 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the price.  $23 for the Salmon Alredo and $36 for the Filet Oscar.  Not bad but just a tad higher than our normal fare."

There were only a few people in the place. I have to say everything was great from start to finish. I had the mixed green salad with peppercorn ranch dressing (a suggestion from our enthusiastic waitress) which was delicious. The filet was scrumptious and perfectly cooked. The au gratin potatoes were wonderful as well - sliced very thinly and not overcooked. The white chocolate raspberry cheescake I had for desert was my least favorite part of the meal, though it was very tasty. I felt it paled in comparison to my friend&#39;s flourless chocolate cake. 

So thanks to Yelp for the suggestion. We really enjoyed our visit. If I could give 4.5 stars, I would."

They were not prepared for this crowd. No we had not made reservations, big mistake. They were sitting everyone and overloading the servers and the kitchen. We were sat outside where two servers were trying to meet the needs of nearly 18 tables, needless to say everything went extremely slow.

We have eaten here before and have had good service and good food. My wife ordered the ribs and they were a little tough, but very tasty. I tried the peppers. They claimed it to be two peppers, actually two halves. Though the ingredients sounded good, they did not meld together well, I would not recommend them, try something else.

Our waitress was very nice and one of the owners, Casey, even came over to see that we were having a nice dinner.

Most of our table ordered the burger which was the Monday special for 6 dollars. It wasn&#39;t terrible but the waitress forgot to add certain condiments that were specified to her.

The last two times we have gone, we have gone on Thurs - it lasts til 7 and we sat at the bar, had 4 or 5 appetizers and a bottle of wine for a great dinner at a really good price.  The shrimp skewers are a favorite - with these unique spicy little red peppers and pineapple, very tasty.  Mussels are also good - the only complaint there is they need to include more toast points.  Also has a Cajun beef slider that was really nice.  Mushroom caps and beef skewers were OK, but instead I would try the ahi tuna next time"

The server didn&#39;t come to our table at first, but when he finally did, he was attentive.  I ordered a glass of wine and it was a nice pour - not skimpy.  We ordered the Asian Calamari appetizer and it was very tasty.  He did not rush us for our dinner orders.  Dinners are on average $24 (unless you order a pasta).  We were there for steaks.  The menu has a good explanation of how to order your steak in terms of rare to well done.  You can also upgrade and buy a sauce for your steak.  We both ordered ribeyes, which come with a starch and small salad.  They could do better on the wimpy salad - but they want you to buy an &#34;upgrade&#34; for $5.  Some sides and veges are also extra $.  I am starting to feel nickled and dimed about now.  Steaks were about half-inch thick, tasty and cooked to order.  They were busy that night and maybe trying to save a minute or two off the cooking time - but that didn&#39;t effect our steaks which were very tasty and juicy.  We ordered dessert, but it would have been nice to see a dessert tray.  Skip the 7-layer chocolate cake - a little dry and just so so.      

The tables are set along the one wall.  Several tables are in front (along the bar area, but elevated and separated by a railing) then 4 booths are across from the open-kitchen/serving station (where we sat) and more tables in back.  There is a back door into the restaurant and thank goodness we weren&#39;t seated at those tables - the people walking in and out would be very distracting!  Especially if you are dropping $100 to $150 for dinner for 2.

Wish they would include more with their entrees (simple sauces, veges, etc) instead of making you pay extra and they could easily make a better salad without charging extra - such an easy thing to do.  I think they are trying to be high-end and the entrees don&#39;t reflect that kind of restaurant."

Had french onion soup and salad with vodka vinagrette which were very good.  We both ordered ribeyes and shared a side of mushrooms which were excellent. The steaks had great flavor but were cooked a little uneven-medium rare on one end and medium at the other. May have been because they were a little on the thin side compared to other prime steaks we&#39;ve had. Overall it was a good experience but somewhat pricey. I have other favs I would go to first if spending that much$."

UPDATE: 5/3/2016

In my previous review I stated our disappointment that our order contained mostly sauce.  We have been in contact with the owners and they truly care and are honest people that run this restaurant. 

They corrected the mistake and we are satisfied.

Truth be known Mast Masala&#39;s Butter Chicken and Matar Paneer are the very best we have ever had of all the Indian Restaurants we have ever gone to.   Whoever does the cooking for this restaurant is not simply a cook but a master chef.  We are not adventurous so we basically stick with Buttered Chicken and Matar Paneer but have sampled enough different Indian restaurants with these two dishes to get a feel for good and great.

Mast Masala&#39;s Butter Chicken and Matar Paneer is not simply good but great.  Easily great.  

If you want really great Indian Food this is the place to go.

And it&#39;s so good, the leftovers are even good cold when you sneak to the fridge at 3 am to experience a bit."

Then out came this Naan bread. If you don&#39;t know what naan bread is, when done right, like they do here, it is the most delicate and delicious bread I have ever had. I also got a chicken tikka masala I think it was and it had this creamy delicious gravy that was amazing with the bread.

This was my first experience with this regional fare and I was stunned at the complexity of flavors as well as the depth the flavors enhanced each other.

It was literally an explosion of flavor with every bite.

I would gleefully come back anytime!

Ambiance: Cozy
Food: OUT-STANDING!!!
Value: no clue, it was my birthday!"

There was a salad dish, veggie samosas, 6 veggie sides (masala, yogurt, curry, saag based), and 2 meat dishes. They also serve fresh roasted red chicken, on a hot plate with onions (which I believe is typical for lunch buffets) and hot naan, both that they bring to the table. The manager (?) there checked in every once in a while to make sure everything was good or if we needed more water. Everything was very tasty and flavorful- the buffet looks small but I typically like smaller buffets because then you know they make it fresh everyday and it gives it a homey feel. Not that I have anything against large buffets, but I feel like making food in smaller batches gives it good quality control. For dessert there was a sweet carrot item (that my friends really enjoyed) and gulab jamun. 

I absolutely love indian food and my friend that I was with, who happens to also be indian, says that Mast Masala is one of her favorite place to go to and get indian food!

***Quick tid-bit (because I&#39;m all up for transparency) : Someone messaged me saying that they had been to Mast Masala in Hanover a few times and wasn&#39;t aware of the lunch buffet.

I&#39;ve only been there once on a Wedn. afternoon, so I am not sure if they have the buffet every lunch weekday or not. I could have been lucky when I went, since my friend was the one who suggested the place. I would suggest calling ahead and asking if they have it that day! There is definitely a (small) buffet at this location!"

I had NEVER tried Indian food before I came here and I am glad I started here because I was totally wowed! First time here, I ordered Butter Chicken and my girlfriend and I shared a plate of Naan. Food came out hot and quickly and it was delicious! I think what I like about Indian food is the layers of flavor in each dish. Everything is amazing! I recently went to the lunch buffet and first of all, WOW, only $8.99 during the week? Crazy! The buffet isn&#39;t huge, but it has so many options! I tried many new things including the Paneer Tikka Masala, which I liked more than the Chicken Tikka Masala! I also tried some lentils and several other entrees (Sorry, I don&#39;t remember what everything is called!). With the buffet, you also get an order of Naan and an order of Tandoori chicken. I loved the Tandoori chicken! Kind of like a dry-rubbed BBQ chicken and it came out sizzling! I wish it was closer to my house so I could eat there more often. 

Mast Masala, you brought Indian cuisine into my life. THANK YOU!"

3 adults and a baby paid a visit to Mast Masala on a Sunday evening because the wife had a hankering for butter chicken.  Although there is no shortage of Indian restaurants in Schaumburg proper, we wanted to try something new...Yelp to the rescue!  For the appetizer, we ordered the green chicken tikka, which we all agreed was moist and full of flavor.  The main course brought us to Vegetable Korma, Butter Chicken, Chicken Vindaloo, garlic naan, onion kulcha, raita, and plain rice.  EVERY single dish was sinfully delicious!

The food took a little longer than your usual Indian restaurant, but holy crap it was worth every second.  Keep it up, MM... you have some new raving fans!"

I LIKE Mast Masala but there&#39;s something about the food that makes me not LOVE it. My Indian food palate isn&#39;t refined enough to tell you what exactly it is about the food here that makes it less delicious than some other Indian places I frequent, but I can tell you that it has a certain sweetness to it. And maybe even an anise/licorice flavor. Maybe it&#39;s a different region than I usually eat but it just seemed off. All of it. 

We got a Butter Chicken, a Chicken Tikka Masala, some garlic naan, and an order of the Aloo Ghobi...our usual try out foods for any new Indian place. I will say this...the standout of our entire meal was the garlic naan. It was HUGE. We ordered 4 orders (one naan an order) thinking they&#39;d be smaller. Big mistake. Each naan is the size of two regular pancakes stuck together. No wonder they were $2.50 each. Sheesh. Needless to say, there&#39;s a couple of leftover naan in the fridge as we speak. Other than the carbs though? Everything else was just okay. The food comes with a ton of sauce (which is great to dip your naan in!) but not a lot of meat. And the meat you do get is somehow really dry. Even the vegetables were just alright and had a different flavor to them than usual. At least it came nice and spicy (white girl spicy, that is) even when ordering it mild. I could even go medium here but surely the hot would burn my mouth off. Be warned. 

Overall, this is a good Indian place, but it&#39;s not great. Guess I have to keep searching for &#34;the one&#34;. Oh well."

They should probably expand their space and get some seating for the guys who are waiting - we had like 3 different groups waiting before us and two after us. Everyone went to walgreens nearby :p

Once seated, I thought the service and staff both were really good. We got some papad w/chutney as complementary. We got the cilantro chciken tikka sizzler as appetizer. Even though, it was SIZZLING it tasted good. We got the butter naan ( 4 pc) with Butter chicken masala - which by far tasted the best among probably about 10 other indian restaurants I have visited in the NW suburbs of chicago. We got the chicken briyani - which had a lot of chicken - which was super cooked and tasted good. It was more like Dum briyani kinda style (not sure if they mixed rice and chicken tikka masala), but I really cant complain about the taste. Good job guys :)..

Since we cook our own Indian food at home, and love it, I was hesitant but willing. Since he is from London and use to the curry shops there, I trusted his judgement on this one and we were not let down. We tried the Lamb Korma and the Chicken Tikka Masala. Since I did not have control of the spices, I had my korma served medium, and his tikka was served hot. Both complimented each other favorably. The lamb was so tender, it was easily cut with a fork. There was a generous amount of gravy in our pots for dipping as well. The meal came with quite enough rice, which by the way was cooked perfectly. We ordered the butter naan and the garlic naan- again - plenty for both of is and delicious. 

The decor was lovely, not at all like a typical London curry shop- which was a pleasant surprise to my husband. After all, it&#39;s not about the decor, it&#39;s about the taste. And this one past his stringent test.. 
Since this is the only Indian Restaurant I have visited in the Chicago area - I am 5 starring it and setting the bar high. 

The price for our meal was a ridiculous $31.00 for 2 people. VERY reasonable, since we left completely full. 

Our server was a young man, a cricket player and was very kind and attentive. He also believe cricket is the greatest game on earth, but I won&#39;t remove a star just for that!"

I ordered lamb vindaloo tonight &amp; it was greasy with a LOT of inedible pieces of unidentifiable &#34;stuff&#34; in it. Our buttered chicken had no curry in it.  I had to go back &amp; ask for rice again.  I&#39;d already paid for our food, and before leaving, I asked the woman who&#39;d taken my money if there was rice in the order.  That stopped the transaction dead in its tracks.  She had to go to the kitchen and get approval to add rice to the order.  I got a small container of white rice - not Basmati rice as the previous owners would give us with our order.  While I was waiting, the owner was standing there staring at me.  No smile, not acknowledgement that I&#39;d just paid $50 for a meal for 3 people.  While I was waiting there, I noticed my shoes were sticking to the floor.

We used to be loyal customers - we came in 10 times over the past year and the food was outstanding.  The new owners clearly don&#39;t get it and they don&#39;t care - we&#39;ve given them 3 chances.   We won&#39;t be back."

So I decided to give this place a try.   First time I did carryout and ordered their Chicken Vinadaloo along with veggie samosas (though I want to find a place that does Keema samosas) and some naan.   I thought the food was fine...was disappointed with the naan portion but then realized they only charged $2 for it and I could take a second order and be satisfied and that price would be around what other places typically charge.

My second visit was a weekday evening.   First good sign was that there were a lot of Indian families at the restaurant.    I was my usual party of one so they sat me in an area away from the families which was nice.

This time I had two orders of the butter naan which more than satisfied the bread order.   I this time ordered the Shrimp Korma along with an appetizer of veggie samosas (still looking for a good keema...sigh) and basmati rice.   I also had an order of mango lassi which I thought was a little more room temperature than I would&#39;ve liked.   Also thought I could&#39;ve used more rice (though maybe I have to do two orders of that as well).   Barely had enough rice for the leftovers the next day.

You just know that these food are of the best quality and are always made fresh. 

Great food and better service! Had the server been a bit upbeat, we&#39;d give a bigger tip. Nonetheless, we&#39;ll def come back for their awesome food:)"

I was rather apprehensive when I first got here on a Monday night; the whole place was empty with just a woman behind the cash register.
Anyways, given it was Monday night, I had to try to be fair--- Paneer tikka masala was very different from what I have had at other Indian restaurants, daal makhani was not-so good, lacked taste and flavor. It was a regular kaali daal with taste not close to typical dal makhani. We will be back for sure to for a in-house service. I shall update my review then."

I never asked!!!.  I know when you start making other restaurants look bad, yours isn&#39;t any better.    He explained they provide more meat and there plates are larger.  I said okay and I don&#39;t care.  When I got home, my chicken dish had  5 or 6 pieces of hard chicken and the rest was just gravy.  I called later and explained and he had no answer.   I told him that I can tell him what happened.  He microwaved my chicken dish.  Chewy and hard! !!    This place is awefull.  Overpriced and takes the easy way out."

However, last night we picked up dinner from there for the first time in a few months, and it was obviously quite different (in a disappointing way).  New chef, perhaps? The shrimp dish (shrimp korma) contained only about 7-8 really overcooked, quarter-sized shrimp.  The onion kulcha was very greasy, and the onions used were quite sharp/bitter, not the usual sweet, mild onions usually found in onion kulcha.  Actually, this was the first time that we didn&#39;t want to save our leftovers in the fridge.  With the overall change in quality and flavor, we&#39;re disappointed.  We&#39;re hoping it was just a fluke, but I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re not likely to venture back."

I was very happy with the service and food they cooked for me.  I ordered the Butter Chicken - Chicken cooked in heavenly tomato and creamy sauce and came with rice; Butter Naan  - Traditional Indian break baked in clay oven with butter, Kadai Chicken - Chicken cooked with fresh onion, tomato, green pepper and traditional Indian spices; and Vegetable Samosa - Vegetable Patties turnovers stuffed potatoes, peas, and spices.

Everything I ordered tasted perfect.  The Butter Chicken had enough spice to it since most Butter Chicken is cooked without any kick to it, the Butter Naan was heavenly.  When biting in to the bread, it was just like walking on clouds.  I haven&#39;t had Naan as awesome as theirs in a long time.  The Kadai Chicken was also cooked to perfection.  The chicken was moist with the perfect amount of spices added to it.  As for the Samosa, it couldn&#39;t have been any better than any other Samosas I&#39;ve eaten.  The flaky bread married with the potato and peas filling made me want to eat it all day.  

I gave this 5 stars because of the customer service I received and how delicious the food was cooked for me."

My boyfriend and I planned to order take out from Mast Masala. We tried calling about 10 times to place our order and then phone just kept ringing and ringing. Finally we decided just to drive over and place an order - about a 15 minute drive. We get there and asked to place a carry out order and they immediately questioned us why we didn&#39;t call ahead with the order - as it will take an hour. At this point I was livid - and told them that we called 10 times without anyone bothering to answer the phone. The least they could have done was accomodate us and take our order. But after discussing with the employees - you could tell that they didn&#39;t care whether or not we were serviced. NEVER WILL COME BACK HERE. Instead we drove over to a competitor of theirs who happily took our order and will take all of our orders in the future. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

First of all, the older man in the restaurant--I think he may be the manager--was extremely inattentive and rude. I&#39;ve never had to order white rice separately (it&#39;s usually included in the meal in any Indian restaurant I go to) but I was told since I didn&#39;t order it, I wouldn&#39;t get it. The appetizers--veggie samosas, seekh kabob and chicken pakoda--were pretty good and they all had distinct flavored from one another. I can&#39;t say the same thing for the main dishes. Butter chicken, shrimp vindaloo and chili paneer all tasted very similar. Even worse, the Vindaloo seems to use the standard american method of drenching everything in tomato sauce. The  only other things we had was okra masala and onion kulcha and those was very good. I have to admit the young server/waiter we had was very friendly and did his job very well. I wouldn&#39;t come here again based on the food quality and long wait for food.

Side note: the food did not sit well with me and I ended up with a nasty case of upset stomach during the night and early the next day."

I came here a couple weeks ago and got the lunch special everyone was talking about.  I went with the butter chicken.  It was damn good.  So was everything else.  Only complaint is they placed me by the window and I bet it was in the 50&#39;s where I was sitting.  Then I went there today for the same.  There was a sign on the window that said no lunch specials today.  Dang.  I went in to ask when they would have them again and they said never.  Double dang.  Well I didn&#39;t feel like paying more money for less variety so I took off.  I then went to go a couple miles down the road to Himalayan.  That place is gone!  Triple dang!  It&#39;s just not my day.

Edit:  So they brought back the lunch specials they told me they weren&#39;t going to have anymore.  It&#39;s like it was before, but doesn&#39;t come with the chicken tandoori anymore, which is a shame since it was really good.  You get filled up for 7 bucks though so it&#39;s still a good deal."

I don&#39;t know how long Mast has been around, but it appears fairly new.
Mast Masala was recommended by a friend (oops, I didn&#39;t yelp search first), and Mast didn&#39;t disappoint.  
Upon first experience, I was impressed.  Mast appears to be a nice, small, clean place.  Everything we ordered seemed very freshly prepared.  Compared to the typical diners of indian cuisine, we eat early enough to qualify for the early bird special.  Place was dead when we arrived.  Some would see this as a bad sign, but the typical diner usually eats later in the evening.  Plus, with the kids, we feel its easier on us, the kids, and the wait staff if we get in and out early before a place gets hectic. 
When we try a new place, we like to first try the old standbys to compare.  However, we deviated a little this time.  We usually get a vegetable pakora to start, but got the pakora platter this time, which had both paneer (cheese) &amp; vegetable pakora.  The vegetables we more of a hash brown, or blended veggie patty, instead of individual fried veggies- very tasty.  The paneer had a green, spicy sauce inside; also very tasty, and 2 of the 3 kids approved.
For main courses, we tried the chicken tikka &#34;sizzler&#34;.  A little different than We are used to, closer to a regular tandoori chicken, but still good, none the less.  Our usual saucy dish was hijacked by our daughter.  She usually just lets us order, as we all share, and we know what everyone likes.  But she decided to open a menu and pick something out, so we went with it.  She chose the chicken curry.  It was very good.  Different, as we typically get a tomato sauce based dish.  As the description says, this has a traditional sauce.  I would order it again, though would probably want to make the rounds on the menu first just to try different things.  We also ordered the mutter paneer, which is a vegetarian dish of peas &amp; paneer in a creamy sauce.  We ordered everything mild, as we didn&#39;t know what we were getting nito, and didn&#39;t want to turn off the kids.  The mutter paneer was so mild, it was almost sweet.  We would probably order this spicier next time.  We had to order 3 full entrees since everything is a la carte, which raised the price we are used to for the cuisine.  We do like the places that offer a &#39;thali&#39; as it provides enough side dishes that we don&#39;t have to order more entrees.  But I suppose the kids are getting older, and they get more expensive to feed.
As we were finishing our meal, every table was full and there were several groups waiting for tables.
We will probably be back.  As we try more of their menu, I can foresee I will likely raise their rating."

Sweet and sour chicken for the kids. Chicken was battered perfectly, and sauce was awesome. They give you way more than you need. Kung Pao chicken was good. Chicken was perfectly cooked, but it had to many large pieces of green pepper for my taste. The portion was huge.

Really liked the Mongolian beef. Huge portion again.
Saved the best for last. This place has the best crab rangoon. Huge pieces that are very crunchy and filled with a ton of cream cheese.

Our new go to place."

I now live across the country, in a place with many more Chinese immigrants, yet I still prefer this restaurant to any I&#39;ve tried in my new home, apart from the very upscale sit-down places.

First, this particular location has consistently screwed up our orders, and this is the last time we will go to any Arby&#39;s anywhere. We had a coupon for a free Beef &amp; Cheddar sandwich with the purchase of another B&amp;C sandwich plus a small drink. We did not receive the drink. The last time we were there, a young man argumentatively insisted he did not short us 2 out of 5 cheese sticks, but he lied, trying to get away with not making a new batch, since it was late. That time, we drove back, but this time, we were not going to return all the way from home. We should have made the trip, however. We should have returned the entire meal for a full refund of the hefty $17.82 we are now out. Other than the putrid tasting &#34;cheddar&#34; cheese on 2 of our four sandwiches, the &#34;Angus Philly&#34; sandwiches were pretty much inedible. Aside from the mega salt content, the &#34;Angus&#34; beef did not resemble any Angus beef that we are familiar with. The cheese and green peppers on these sandwiches were also a joke. The actual size and appearance of all of Arby&#39;s sandwiches look NOTHING like the menu photos either. Also, how does one manage to make lousy onion rings? The onions in the bitter tasting batter were almost flavorless. Garbage dinner for almost $18, which was so unpleasant, we couldn&#39;t even finish it."

The place is clean, and the staff was nice enough. But the steak tacos I ordered were NOT good: no seasoning, poor texture *(like they had been reheated) and one of the taco&#39;s &#34;tomato&#34;. was literally just the top of the tomato (where the stem is) Also, I requested cilantro, and it was not put on. (not sure if I was charged for that, as I never got a bill, just a total) 
The beans &amp; rice tasted as though they had been microwaved, also no seasoning or flavor. 
The only decent part was the french fries I ordered for my child. Very disappointed, not sure if this was just a one off, but I wouldn&#39;t waste my money again (bill came to $17)

The torta is another of my favorite foods from this establishment ($3.90). It comes in a soft, fluffy, warm sub-style bread. A hefty size. Doesn&#39;t taste like cardboard. You can pick the meat, and the other fillings are beans, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and avocado slices.

Tostadas are good too, toppings piled high with avocado pieces on top (~$2.90). Their small burrito is $2.90, but it&#39;s a lot of food. Gorditas are good as well. Tamale was okay. It was my first time trying an horchata and since I have a sweet tooth, the taste was such a pleasant surprise. A milky sweetness with some cinnamon. Definitely a dessert and treat for me, especially great on a hot summer day.

UPDATE June &#39;14 - I&#39;m not sure if they have the $1 taco specials anymore because the menu board doesn&#39;t list it. Tacos are $1.55, on the small side, still tasty. Nice neighborhood taco joint."

It would appear that the new owners bought the rights to the name and the physical location, but did not acquire any of the secrets to the &#34;old&#34; Jalisco flavors and friendliness. I&#39;m sure that it is not a coincidence that the unfavorable reviews begin after the first few months of 2014 - the new owners appear to have taken over at that time.

I got a 3 taco meal, and I got a chicken taco, a beef taco, and a pork taco.  I swear, I at the chicken one first and thought it was the best thing I&#39;ve ever tasted.  Then I ate the beef, and then the shredded pork - and each one was better than the one before!  Just fantastic!

The side dishes have actual FLAVOR, not just salty and hot.  Just fantastic place."

I really loved Jalisco at first but we&#39;ve fizzled out somewhat. Their food is still good but not the best I&#39;ve had. The prices are a-ok with me though, I ordered a side of rice, guacamole, and a large horchata for like $6. Sweet. Their guac is prob the highlight of their existence (at least to me), traditional, fresh and delicious with nice size chunks of avocado in it. Located next to my bf&#39;s salon so it&#39;s great to stop in for a bite when I&#39;m waiting around for him to finish up. It is always very clean and the service is courteous and quick. Also, they have a nice flat screen for watching telenovelas which I don&#39;t understand.  I don&#39;t worship Jalisco like I used to, but I dig it for a quick bite."

Both times I&#39;ve been to francesca&#39;s I&#39;ve experienced this. I ordered the Alaskan halibut the first time. This was the best fish I&#39;ve ever had. It was prepared with creamy polenta and a sauce that made it&#39;s $30 price tag worth every dollar. I went back specifically for this dish and to my disappointment it wasn&#39;t on the menu. I ordered the seabass with mushrooms and leak sauce. Holy Christ. This chef is amazing!!!!!!!!  Again the flavors worked together so well. The fish didn&#39;t have any hint of that ugly fishiness. It was perfect. 

The first time the staff was a little creepy. They were all lines up on the back wall staring at everyone eating and talking amongst themselves. It gave a very awkward feeling like we were being talked about. The food was so incredible that I went back regardless of the servers. The second time I had an amazing server. Very friendly and filled my cup the moment it was empty.  A much better environment than the first time.

Move over Bob Chinns. You have nothing, NOTHING on francescas!!! I can&#39;t wait for my next visit!!"

The big thing was that the service was super fast....like courses arriving before you are done with the next. It&#39;s a Tuesday night, 1/2 dozen empty tables....why are you hustling me out the door? 
Overall more curb appeal than actual diner appeal."

I&#39;d heard great things about this restaurant and was always curious when driving by, so last night I finally made a reservation and ate there. We started with drinks from the bar, which tasted fine but had too much ice and not enough of the actual cocktail. 

For dinner, we started with the risotto appetizer. I LOVE risotto, but hated this one. It had very little taste aside from the goat cheese, which I wasn&#39;t a fan of. I ordered the Penne Alle Verdure, which was again lacking in taste and very underwhelming. I thought to myself &#34;I could totally make this myself at home for way less money&#34;.  My boyfriend had the roasted chicken and my friend had a gluten free pasta. My boyfriend did like his dish and my friend said hers was okay, but nothing special.

Our service was good. He was timely and pretty friendly. The food came fast and he accommodated my friend&#39;s gluten allergy. No complaints there! 

Overall, maybe my expectations were too high coming into this experience, but for the money ($125 with tip for 2 drinks, an appetizer, 3 meals and a gelato), I really believe could have gotten a much better meal somewhere else. I will continue searching for a good suburban Italian restaurant."

We both said at the same time how it was the closest thing to being in Italy or parts of Croatia.  The bread alone was like being back in Italy.  The waitress was wonderful and recommended the spinach ravioli with vodka sauce!  It was exquisite.  The warm apple caramel tart was made in-house and was a little piece of heaven!

We attended a family event here and took up two of their adjoining semi-private separate dining areas (you can still see out into the rest of the restaurant, I&#39;m not sure if there are curtains that could be closed or not).  Upon arrival our water glasses were filled right away but it took quite a while or the servers to come by and take drink orders (10 minutes after we sat down). After that initial slowness all the service was quick and very gracious.  The water glasses were promptly filled each time and each food course came out quickly.

Each table dined family style from the pre-selected catering menu and we had: minestrone soup, dinner salad, rigatoni in a creamy tomato sauce w/parmesan, Pollo arrosto alla Romana (rosemary/lemon chicken w/potatoes - delicious!), Italian sausage w/bell peppers &amp; onions, and for dessert cream puffs filled with vanilla ice cream &amp; topped with chocolate sauce (children had cups of ice cream rather than risk them dealing with the slippery cream puffs that would certainly have ended up on the floor otherwise).  Everything was good and there was plenty of food for each table but the chicken dish was the stand out with that delicious sauce.  The warm Italian bread on the table was very good, as well.

All in all it was a nice place to host an event and from what I heard they made it very easy with the planning, options, etc."

The pastas are fantastic (I recommend the rigatoni if you&#39;ve never been). The pizzas are very unique. My favorite thing I have to get every time though is the carpaccio.

This is my second time visiting Francesca&#39;s. First was for a bridal shower. At the shower (held in the private back room) the service was great and the food was pretty good. We had appetizer of pizza that was passed, which was my favorite of the courses. We also had a mixed salad and a rigatoni pasta (good but salty). 

Visited again for our anniversary dinner and food was pretty good. We had the carpaccio to start; I thought it was good and I enjoyed the addition of endive and radicchio however I thought the steak was almost cut too thing where it didn&#39;t hold up amongst the mushrooms/lemon/caper mix. It was still very good. For dinner my husband got the farfalle with ham and peas which was really good. That was the best thing we got that night. I got the lobster fettuccini special. It was good but my husband&#39;s was better. The fettuccini could have used another minute in the sauce to soak it in. Next time I would like to try the risotto and white fish dishes. 

They also brought us some free moscato di asti with cherries to celebrate our anniversary which was a nice touch. 

Again, found the dinner enjoyable and reasonably priced. Looking forward to visiting again and trying other items."

As soon as I walked in I was greeted pleasantly and had nothing but outstanding customer service during my entire visit.

We began with a drink at the bar and our bartender Rene (who also ended up being our server) was extremely personable.

I ordered the Rigatoni alla Norcina, a pasta with sausage, pancetta, and three cheese sauce.  The pancetta made the dish!  It was much better than the Gnocci A&#39;Emilliana that I had eaten previously at their other location.  Someone in our party ordered the gnocchi and the portion was quite small just as it was at the St. Charles location.  He was finished eating significantly sooner than the rest of us and seemed disappointed in his portion.

The service was almost rushed. I know they close at 10, and we got there at 8, but still it felt a little rushed.

The service was absolutely great - I loved our waiter. He was polite, patient, attentive, and very accommodating. The food was also delicious. My favorite was the Rigatoni alla Siciliana and the Pizza alla Schiacciata alla Toscana. The rigatoni was the perfect amount of spice and flavor; the lemon on the pizza added the perfect touch to the truffle oil and parmesan cheese flavors. It was a bit too much mozzarella cheese for my personal taste but I enjoyed it nonetheless. We also got the bruschetta and the asparagus salad, which I thought was alright. The bruschetta was a bit more goat cheese than actual tomatoes. Overall really enjoyed my experience and will definitely be back! :)"

This was my first time here as I&#39;ve been to Francesca&#39;s N. only both on Taylor street and in Northbrook. This is under the same restaurant umbrella. Same menu layout and concept and a small selection of fresh, quality food. All are equally delicious. 

They write their menu, so you know the items sometimes change. The menu is small and not overwhelming. Service was excellent and the food was unreal, shut-the-front-door, out of this world. You get unlimited hot table side bread. You can order custom scratch made pizza-what my friend ordered. 

Probably some of the best ravioli I&#39;ve had in quite a while. It was Ravioli Alla Sorella. That sauce, made with wine, and light scratch made ravioli elevated the dish. A touch of spinach, red peppers, and pieces of chicken, is a dish worth the while. Rich yet light and flavorful. I&#39;ll visit again."

They serve great food, even rotating their menu every so often which helps change things up. I absolutely love their gnocchi, so get it while you can because it often sells out when they do have it. They serve bread with oil and cheese when you first arrive, and their menu is filled with great pastas, pizzas, and salads. I also recommend following up with some tiramisu or other yummy Italian dessert they serve, because they are good :). The only thing is they have paper on top of their tables, mostly because they give crayons to kids to let them color on it, but it takes away from the fancy, intimate feel of the restaurant. But, my family loves either ordering take out or going in to Francesca&#39;s when we crave really good pasta."

In the are, searched Yelp for a nice spot. Lacks a little bit of everything from service to food. Not impressed at all with the atmosphere, decor is nice but no ambiance if you arrive before the dinner rush. It felt like we were just a practice run at 5 pm. Staff was either lingering or walking around in the dining as if they had not opened yet. Our server was friendly but smelled like he just finished a cigarette and was awkward and not very well trained, no polish. Caprese salad in an Italian restaurant deserves way more than the presentation and flavor offered. Pasta side with a basic garlic oil, spinach, tomato toss was so al dente it was more like not done and salty beyond edible. We eat out a lot and enjoy fine casual dining, almost always have dessert with a cup of coffee, even when we are stuffed. Skipped dessert and chalked it up to a loss."

I would have appreciated if they could have let me know given the menu wasn&#39;t even an option and there was nothing on the website re: the change. While the food ended up being decent, it was a hot mess by the buffet. I get that there were kids there but the wait staff need to do a better job of refilling and cleaning up the buffet station faster - it just wasn&#39;t very appetizing. 

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll bother going back again.  I don&#39;t know why Francesca&#39;s has a high reputation. I equated it to an above average Olive Garden."

We ordered drinks and they arrived about 5 minutes later which was pretty fast for a Saturday night. We immediately placed our order for our food thinking it be a wait since it was ind of busy but again we only waited maybe like 30minutes for it to get there.
My girlfriends and I ordered pasta and their portions are quite big we asked for a box! Another thing I really like is that they have Free Valet parking as well.

Today I joined a group of coworkers at the bar (around 4 pm, not one other customer inside there except our group of 9 ladies) to celebrate a birthday. The waiter we had at first was the douchebaggiest snarky punk A-HOLE I have ever encountered.  We decided to order some appetizers about 15 minutes after we sat down and asked if we could have a menu. He said- (I shit you not) &#34;you said when you got here you didn&#39;t need any menus! I&#39;ll be over in a bi.t&#34; and continued to roll silverware for the next 3 minutes. He got our group of 9 people ONE menu. We asked for more and he brought us only one more.  Honestly? It&#39;s like he was trying to be jerky.

Then, to place our appetizer orders we had to basically drag him away again from what he was working on and he started walking away and I had to shout my order as he was rushing from the table. If I was a manager at this restaurant and witnessed how rude he was to us, I would have fired him on the spot. We are all reasonable, kind people and are teachers and definitely understand if it is super busy or something but being downright rude for the sake of being a snarky jerk? Absolutely not. Most of us were pretty upset by him and said we didn&#39;t want to come back here because of his behavior. 

However, I did give this place 2 stars because it must have been the end of his shift and the guy that took over was super sweet and wonderful and the pizza tasted really good. Due to our awful treatment, I won&#39;t be back."

We sat at a booth in the bar area and aside from the over-bright lighting there, it was relatively comfortable.  (But those pin lights shouldn&#39;t be in the faces of people when they&#39;re eating...).
The menu is small but there&#39;s items available that aren&#39;t listed, and that&#39;s what I had: Chicken Parmigian, a Caesar salad and a tequila gimlet.
The salad was good and the chicken parm was excellent!  My associate had the pasta special with seafood and he was very happy.  Overall, a very good place that&#39;s worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area."

She could not be more easy to work with!  The first reason I picked this place was because there was no room charge, you could bring in a cake with out being charged, and everything was included in the cost of the menu plan.  Many places add on tons of extra charges, Francesca&#39;s doesn&#39;t!  

They allowed me to make changes easily to the menu, and made it clear they could handle last minute changes like a gluten issue easily as well. Julie gave lots of impute and helped us with decoration ideas as well.  My emails were responded to quickly, and put up with my 50 questions! 

On the day of everyone helped us bring in our decorations, introduced themselves, and doubled checked the menu and timing of service. They were OUTSTANDING!  Two guys helped us bring our gifts out to our cars as well. I have never seen better service before.  The food was wonderful as well, it always is. 
Thank you to everyone at Francesca&#39;s!"

If you&#39;ve been to other Francesca&#39;s restaurants, the food is consistant, traditional, and oh so yummy. There were a few things, however, that really stood out to me and why I&#39;ll always consider going to a Francesca&#39;s for a small event like a baby shower:

* they don&#39;t charge for the room reservation!!! Literally every other place that we looked at either had a minimum number of people (20 or more) or charged at least $150 for the 3 hour event. When Julie, the coordinator, told me that they only charged us for the food we ate (and of course tax and gratuity), I was sold!

* the variety of menu options for our event was great! We could do a family style, sit down plated, or (what we chose) a buffet appetizer course. They had a variety of menu options as well as a variety of price points, based on the quantity of food and how long the service lasted. Their special events options made it so easy to find an option for us! 

* the appetizer buffet was perfect for our baby shower of 13 people! We started with passed appetizers of chicken skewers while we stood around and chatted. When we sat down, we had a buffet of white pizza (delicious!!), bruschetta, and a risotto. I loved that they charged us per person, but refilled the buffet as many times as we needed during the hour of food that we paid for. AND we got to take home anything that was left! When our food time was finished, they just left it out for us to nibble on while we chatted and opened presents. Not only was the food delicious, but no one left hungry.

* I left Julie know that we had one of the guests who was allergic to gluten. They were AMAZING with providing us with gluten-free options for every piece of the meal! They provided gluten free bread, a small plate of gluten free bruschetta (which they kept refilling!) and one of the pizzas was made gluten free as well! All this, with no extra charge to the event!

* one word...doughnuts! Francesca&#39;s is affiliated with Glazed and Infused and we were able to order a tray of 50 mini doughnuts for $35! They have a variety of doughnuts including maple bacon (yum!!!), pumpkin chocolate chip (a seasonal but very yummy), and even did a gluten free for our guest that is allergic to gluten! Although you have to ask for the option, it&#39;s a great way to get something different!

I was so pleased with the service, the food, and the overall experience! This is definitely going to be one of my go-tos for events AND a nice dinner :)"

The menu is relatively small compared to some restaurants however most of what they do on that menu is done right. The offerings are generally made with few fresh ingredients. Very Italian in this approach. Pasta portions are large as you would expect but not Maggiano&#39;s size. However, most pasta dishes are done with a few fresh ingredients and I really appreciate the chefs deft hand. They have an eggplant and mozzarella cheese pasta dish that is quite outstanding. It&#39;s vegetarian friendly but there are of course several meat dishes that are quite good. Appetizers and salads are a bit pricey however the salad themselves usually have some high-end ingredients and my experience is that they are fresh and served quite cold which I appreciate so despite the higher cost it&#39;s well done and worth it. Entrees can range in price so if you are looking to either split a pasta or eat on the cheap you can order some of the lower priced pasta entrees. Wine menu is excellent and the wine has always been good. Atmosphere is casual but elegant.  I&#39;ve seen couples out for a romantic dinner, larger groups and families with children. Overall the wait staff in my experience has been excellent."

I was here for a luncheon meeting recently and was unimpressed with the food.  The food was served family style and included salad, chicken with capers served on spinach, pasta in a marinara sauce, and tiramisu.  The ice tea was incredibly weak and the bread served with the meal was not very good. With the exception of the tiramisu the food was very bland and would not encourage me to return and spend my own money on a meal here.  My recommendation is to spend your money elsewhere."

Francesca&#39;s also offers a really pretty party room for wedding and baby showers and a decent sized bar for when you need a cocktail or four. 

Will you find uber creative dishes akin to Chicago&#39;s Italian scene? No. But you&#39;ll find items that supersede the traditional chicken parm and fettuccine alfredo. I was especially satisfied with the mammoth tortellini portion - not only was the spinach and chicken tortellini flavorful and filling, but there was enough pasta for two additional lunches after I made a sizeable dinner dent. Talk about value, folks. 

As mentioned, the service is exceptional here. Servers are just as friendly and accommodating to couples and families and are often going far out of there way to ensure a pleasant dining experience. So, at the end of the day, if you&#39;re seeking fresh, fairly straight forward Italian eats in Arlington Heights that won&#39;t break the bank, Francesca&#39;s Tavola is a great choice."

The risotto was so heavy and so al dente. The shrimp pasta we ordered was again so al dente it was inedible. Disgusting, the pasta was all stuck together. The shrimp was tough.

We were greeted and seated immediately.  I personally do not prefer the style of seating where you are seated at separate tables, but on a big long booth on one side with chairs on the other, but that was my only complaint.  We were served bread with seasoned olive oil and grated cheese without asking.  

The menu has a select number of meal choices, but it is a good variety and we have never been disappointed.  I am a vegetarian, and I have not had trouble finding something on the menu to eat.  Our waitress was attentive, but also embraced the Italian spirit of &#34;relaxing with wine&#34; for a while before ordering, and I did not get the sense that I was either rushed or forgotten.  

My meal was absolutely delicious.  I got some pasta dish with mushrooms, artichokes and goat cheese, and it was so tasty.  Their sauce is mouth-wateringly flavorful.  We also had wine, which was wonderful.  Very smooth and flavorful.  It was the Avalon Cabernet.  The tiramisu was perhaps the best part, although everything was so delicious it is hard to say what was the best part.  Anyways, the tiramisu was not too sweet, but sweet enough so that the subtle hints of the cocoa came through.  The ladyfingers were soaked in the rum and espresso, but not saturated.  It was absolutely perfect.  I was full, but could not stop eating.  

I will definitely be returning to this place because they know how to combine music, food, ambiance, wine, and service to make an exceptional dining experience."

+ DELIOUS FOOD!  DELICIOUS FOOD!  DELICIOUS FOOD!
+ Free valet parking (Please tip the valets. They are super nice.)
+ On site parking lot if you prefer to park your own car.
+ Nice ambiance. Perfect for dinner date nights or family dinners.  
+ They also have a bar area if you&#39;re interested.
+ Great service!  Waitress was friendly/attentive.  She had perfect timing checking us.  Neither intrusive nor &#34;missing in action&#34;.  Just perfect.  
+ More top notch service: Bus boys were super friendly and attentive. Plates cleared right away, water and drinks refilled, etc.
+ Food was served after appropriate wait time at perfect temperature.
+ Clean restaurant and clean bathrooms.

- Rather expensive:
Husband had RAVIOLI TRADIZIONALI (ravioli) , I had GIAMBERI e CAPESANTE al VINO BLANCO (shrimp and scallops in white wine and sauteed spinach).  Ordered soup (extra charge) and pasta in red sauce (extra charge).  For drinks we had Perrier water and Diet Coke.  Total bill was $65 + tip.  

Did not mind the cost because we had great service and delicious food!

Tip:  By 7PM, the restaurant got crowded.  Patrons were groups of friends, families having a nice dinner, or couples.  Make early reservations if you want a little more peace and quiet. 

We will be back!"

Their menu always sounds great (I don&#39;t really like that they hand-write the menu...it&#39;s hard to read), but the food is disappointing. It lacks flavor. I got something that the Cheesecake Factory sells (it was almost exactly the same), but it tasted bland. For that reason alone I probably won&#39;t come back. It&#39;s not worth the money.

ANY app/salad + ANY entree + ANY dessert for $25.  an amazing deal when a lot of the entrees themselves are $25.  i only give 4 stars because the pasta entree i&#39;ve had both times (pasta primavera) was very bland and could use more vegetables.  the other vegi choices have always been something too heavy for my taste - gnocchi or risotto so i&#39;ve opted for something &#34;off the menu&#34;.  huge plates of carpaccio and prosciutto were passed around the table because of course all portions are too large for one person.  i recommend the snow pea salad or the green bean salad - nice to have salad &#34;options&#34; other than the usual mixed greens or caesar.  the desserts are the best part of the meal (apple crostada!) and if you come with a large party, every dessert on the menu can be ordered and shared!  a very affordable family/big group dining experience with enough change to spare to splurge on some bottles of wine."

The bruschetta appetizer is a bit small for the price but is done relatively well, especially the choice of cheese. I wish the mussels they offered used the Prince Edward Island variety but that doesn&#39;t seem to be too common around Chicagoland. The broth was pretty good but not great.

I found their &#34;prime rib&#34; (steak) to be prepared in a very oily manner with an herb mixture that I didn&#39;t really like too much, similar to the one at Wildfire. The meatball sandwich had pretty good meatballs and crispy bread but the salad was a little heavy handed on the balsamic vinegar. Their creamy pasta was kind of excessively creamy and oily while their broth and vegetables one had an alright taste but was a bit too oily as well.

Fortunately their profiteroles were delicious and both crunchy and creamy at the same time.

Oddly, like some other restaurants I&#39;ve gone to recently I found the appetizers and desserts to be better than the main entrees. This restaurant is a decent alternative to Biaggis although it gets busy pretty early so make sure you put in a reservation. I would give it a higher rating if they could preserve the taste without making the food so unhealthy with oil and salt."

The wait staff was excellent - quickly seated, specials explained, drinks and warm bread served, and orders neatly delivered.  As an added bonus, there was free valet parking in their parking lot at this location.

While were there for dinner on a Saturday night, and the place was hopping busy - so be sure to make a reservation ahead of time.  

Patrons were attired in an interesting mixture of casual to dressy.  Really you could wear whatever you want, and you would feel perfectly at ease.  

This is a fantatic place for date night - celebrate a special occasion in their private rooms - or just to get a fantastic Italian meal.  No matter the reason, you&#39;re sure to enjoy!

The room has a slight Old World, rustic Italian feel with modern touches.  Tables are covered in butcher paper that lend to the relaxed feel, yet the surrounding room decor keeps the place classy.

And the food...ooohhh, the food.  Excellent!  Wonderful!  Authentic!  Delicioso!  The spinach ravioli my friend ordered was handmade and melt in your mouth tender.  The rigatoni her husband ordered was equally fine and perfectly matched with light sausage ragu.  The pan seared tilapia I ordered was perfection and mouthwatering good.  Drinks were enjoyed by all, and they were tasty and well made, including uniquely Italian options.  And yes, we were tempted by desserts!  The Creme Brule was excellent...but the Tiramasu was out of this world!

I&#39;ll definitley be back to sample more dishes.

Mangia bene, vivi felice!  In other words, you&#39;ll &#34;eat well, live happy&#34; when you come here!"

I liked the place and the food that evening.  I ordered one of the specials (of which I can not recall the name and they do not post the specials online).  It was some sort of hand rolled ravioli like pasta with a meat filling and a non-red sauce.  It was very tasty.  The service was good but seemed to taper off after our food arrived.  That could be due to getting close to closing though.  At that point I was 3 of 5 stars and would return again.

Until 2:30 am came along and I was purging what was left of that food.  So while it was tasty, no amount of tasty would be worth the very uncomfortable morning and following day I experienced.  Since I tend to have a cast-iron stomach this had to be REALLY bad to cause this reaction.  I can only imagine that ill food prep or components are the cause of this ordeal.  I cannot recommend nor would I walk into any Francesca&#39;s ever again."

I cannot say enough positive words about my experience at Francesca&#39;s Tavola. I urge everyone to ignore any negative reviews because my experience with this restaurant was like a dream.

I reserved a party room for a family member&#39;s surprise party, months in advance. Not only was the Events Coordinator, Julie, immensely helpful... she went above and beyond to answer all of my many questions, and she allowed us to tour the space beforehand. The staff allowed us to store our cake in the cooler on the day of the event, and they did not charge a plating or cutting free. Julie&#39;s kindness, attention to detail, and professionalism will always be remembered. I highly recommend Francesca&#39;s for any birthday, party, or event in which a private party room is required.

Julie&#39;s incredible service was absolutely reflected in the service and atmosphere of the restaurant as whole. The space is beautiful and pristinely clean. Servers were friendly, and the bussers here were, no exaggeration, the kindest, most thoughtful, and talented busboys I have ever encountered. One amazing busboy (whose name escapes me! Possibly Renee?) asked if we would like something to drink as we were setting up, he helped us put up a banner, he brought out a lighter for the cake and cut perfect pieces, and he wrapped all of desserts up for us to take home.

The food was amazing. I highly recommend the risottos and Pollo al Limone (that sauce was incredible). All of the courses were spaced out nicely and never overlapped, which I appreciated since it enabled us to use the full time in the room. The tiramisu and profiteroles for dessert were delectable. Our party had 32 people, and this room was the perfect size. 

I cannot thank Julie and the staff of Francesca&#39;s enough for their assistance and genuine kindness. Props to the chef for his amazing creations. And the bus boys here deserve a promotion or at least major special notice-- we were all blown away. Francesca&#39;s is highly recommended, and I will definitely return when I am in town. (I prefer Francesca&#39;s to most Italian restaurants downtown!) Thank you for making our event so special and memorable!!"

My mom and I worked with Julie in their event department while planning the dinner. Every question we had Julie responded with urgency and was very helpful in assisting us with our menu for the special evening. We were able to do a tasting about a month prior which also helped. By the time the big day rolled around, both my mom and I were able to relax and enjoy our family and celebrate the Bride and Groom. All of the wait staff were extremely attentive, but not over-bearing. Not to mention, the food was EXCELLENT! Better than our tasting. We will definitely be back soon!"

The ambiance is classic Chicago Italian, not too brightly lit, beautiful bar area, lots of white linen tablecloths and napkins.  Whether you eat at the spacious bar or in the dining room, the service is excellent.  Prices are average for the area, and they have a nice beer and wine offering.  The bartenders and wait staff are friendly and really know the menu.  Every meal has been great!  The prosciutto Modo Mio, risotto with leeks, corn and prosciutto was creamy and very good.  Carpaccio, and Prosciutto with Figs are two more favorite appetizers.  We love the Spaghetti Con Frutti Del Mare, and Roasted Grouper and Tilapia, all favorite entrees.  I highly recommend this establishment."

It was one of her favorite places and I had never been there before and always up for trying new places for me. Made reservations and had no issues getting seated. The staff  was very friendly. The food was delicious as well. The atmosphere was also very warm and appealing. My one issue was when it came to dessert. I had called the restaurant a couple days ahead and asked if they had any traditions or did anything special for someone&#39;s birthday. I was told they did and they even verified my reservations and asked what my girlfriend&#39;s name was. So I was pretty set in thinking they were going to surprise her with the birthday dessert. Alas, that never happened. At the completion of dinner our server came by with the dessert menu and asked if we saved room. I was waiting for the birthday dessert. Nothing. So we went about our way. I wanted it to be a surprise so I didn&#39;t even bother to pursue it. To me, it would just simply ruin the surprise element for her to see me ask when it was set up in advance. Fortunately, my girlfriend did appreciate the gesture when I explained to her afterwards how disappointed I was with that happening (or not happening). I should have excused myself to go to the bathroom and followed up before dinner was over, but was convinced it was already a done deal. It&#39;s a minor mistake in the big scheme of things, but a bummer in celebrating her birthday at dinner. Outside of that, it&#39;s a nice place to frequent. The other bummer was that they were out of my first two beer choices. I guess it jsut wasn&#39;t my day to really enjoy my first time there."

The menu is handwritten and difficult to read, and they have no idea how busy -- or not -- they really are. They told us the wait was 1 hour 20 minutes - 30 minutes. We glanced around, and the restaurant was half-empty. The hostess told me, &#34;There&#39;s a ton of people coming in five minutes with reservations,&#34; so we went to sit by the bar. 10 minutes went by and not a person came in. All of a sudden, the hostess grabbed us and seated us at one of the many empty booths. Hoorah... one success.

I ordered a chicken dish which had some garlic sauce with it. I asked for it without, as I get very sick from garlic, and sure enough it arrived floating in the garlic sauce. It almost seemed like they went out of their way to put extra. Even my family, who usually pick on me for being so picky, thought it was ridiculous. I couldn&#39;t eat my dinner, and the waitress didn&#39;t even ask why when she came to pick it up.

We hadn&#39;t been to Francesca&#39;s since 2006 when one of their waiters spilled wine all over my expensive handbag that was a gift from my grandparents. They never offered any compensation, not even a free coffee or dessert, but my mom was craving their chicken after all this time.

Strike two, and I won&#39;t be giving them more money so they can earn a third."

The place was about half full - I sat at a tall table in the bar - no bartender was present, but they were using the bar to serve food if desired. Service was a little off - it seemed like their bus staff was serving that day. Nice people, but I didn&#39;t get the sense that they knew service. This was magnified when I asked for some grated cheese not in my rigatoni entree, but into the olive oil plate for my bread. Well, the server stacked it at least two inches high!

The decor was a little different - a copper top ceiling in the bar that I&#39;d not seem anything like it before. They were playing 80&#39;s music - really?

I guess I&#39;d go there again - maybe for dinner to see if they have an A-Team that works at night. Not really like any other Francesca&#39;s I&#39;ve been to before."

I usually meet friends here because I lnow the GF menu is extensive, and no mater my mood there is something for me!   However gluten-free should still be tasty. Not bland and uneatable; covering the whole thing with garlic didn&#39;t make it better. 

This is the first time I have ever been disappointed at Francesca&#39;s.  I usually love it!! Something was way off the evening we were there.   It was not crowded as it was the start of spring break in Arlington Heights.  There were empty tables. As well as chairs available at the bar.  

***Take the Penne with Spinach and tomato off the menu. It needs more tweaking. It needs  flavor.  

$5 martini night on Friday nights is a good deal.  This is usually what lured us in and then we realize we are hungry."

The first time the service was awesome and the food was quite good.  I had the gnocchi with tomato basil sauce and it was awesome.  My hubby had pasta with pot roast which was ok and we had the apple crostata for dessert which was amazing.  This visit was on a Sunday and I guess it was busier than they expected because less than 2 hours after they opened they were out of both of our first choice dishes and also my second choice dish.

The second visit wAs on a Monday and I got rigatoni with sausage and mushrooms.  It was ok, nothing special.  The many reason I ordered it was because nothing else on the menu sounded good to me or was food that I eat (I don&#39;t like mussels, scallops, or veal).  My husband ordered the lasagna which was what we both originally wanted to order when we first went.  When the lasagna was brought out it was totally burnt so we sent it back.  Then a new one came out and the center of it wasn&#39;t even hot.  We also ordered the apple crostata again because I had liked it so much the first time, but that wasn&#39;t nearly as good as it had been on the first visit.

Overall, will I be back?  Probably not, the food and service are extremely inconsistent and the menu varies so much that I don&#39;t even know if anything I like will even be on the menu."

Menu was handmade and printed off of a printer or copier.  Very impressed as what was available was what was bought that day or so.  Fresh came to mind.

Drinks were disappointing with short shots and lots of ice.  Come on guys!  Even a double was watery. Get smaller glasses, larger pours &amp; less ice or replace/retrain/remotivate the bartenders.  Next time will order wine.

Dinner specials do not have salad included, so ordered one.  It was very nice sized with O&amp;V dressing, tomato, cucumber and good mound of lettuce.

Appetizer was special beef carpaccio and it was wonderful with capers and freshly shaved parm cheese.  Very yum.

Dinnermate had fish which looked good and it was not shared.  A good sign.  My pasta with muscles and clams was abundant in pasta and shells.  Very good, made fresh tomato sauce.

Once we waved off dessert the waitress abandoned us.  Could not even get her near to order another watered drink, but that was all for the good.

This has good food, marginal service, crappy drinks and a nice atmosphere.  And you could talk at your table, so noise was minimal.  Give it a shot...it will probably be a lot larger that what you will get from the bar in return."

We came to Francesca&#39;s for a birthday dinner and left pretty unhappy.  Sure, the service was good (it was empty on a weeknight) and the bread was okay.  And the a fore mentioned half price bottle of wine.  But aren&#39;t we really here for the food?

Their martinis are great. They have a wide selection. I asked them to put a graham cracker crust on the key lime pie martini and they were happy to do so. 

Love the olive oil and pepper for the bread. The bread is gooood!

Both parties I&#39;ve had the vesuvio chicken. It&#39;s small, though. For $16- $18 I kind of expected a full grown size chicken. With this one, I could eat all the meat on the thigh in one bite.

Potatos were great. The bruschetta is also good. 

All in all, consistently good service. Good food. LIke the atmosphere alot, though on the weekend nights it is LOUD.

Give it a try."

My husband and I have been dining here for years. This month I filled out the comment card and to my surprise won a raffle and get $10 off once a month for 12 months. We are expecting our first child any day now and I appreciate that for the next year I am guaranteed at least one &#34;date night&#34; a month (thankfully my parents live close enough to babysit!)

We went for our first &#34;date night&#34; last night. I had the special linguini with scallops and a creamy tomato sauce--fantastic plus leftovers, yay! My husband had the salmon which came with avocado and asparagus and some other tasty looking bits. No appetizer or dessert this time around but only because there is not enough room (38 weeks pregnant will do that to a lady&#39;s stomach).

The manager, Rian, who informed me of my raffle prize, also sought us out to congratulate us on our growing family and thank us for dining with them. The wait staff is always very friendly and the busboys do a fabulous job refilling water, iced tea and boxing up leftovers!

In the past I have also gone here for some business lunches and the tilapia with capers and white wine sauce is always a winner. 

Wednesday nights are great since $25 will get you an appetizer, entree and dessert.

And when we went earlier this month we split a caprese salad made with grilled peaches instead of tomatoes (it was a special that night) and it was super tasty!

My absolute favorite menu item is the shell pasta with ham, peas, mushrooms and creamy tomato sauce--it is so good on a chilly night!"

The service was fabulous.  Our waiter was a mid-20&#39;s young man about 6&#39; or so tall with short hair and an athletic build - sorry, I forgot your name and feel badly about it.  The waiter who tag-teamed was not quite as tall and had curly hair.

All questions were answered and we decided on the price fixe option for $25.00.  My husband and I chose to split an appetizer and salad instead of choosing one or the other.  We ordered the bruschetta with mozzarella and were so happy, the bread was perfectly toasted and the topping was out of this world, tangy and basilly with creamy mozzarella - everything was so fresh.  It tasted like it was made to order. 

The salad was amazing too, We ordered the Insalata alla Francesca - romaine, endive, radicchio, blue cheese, fresh veggies - extremely fresh food.  I didn&#39;t need salad dressing for this creation.  My husband ordered the house Italian and was delighted.  

When the main courses came out, we were still amazed at how good the food was.  Mark&#39;s was a sausage and onion pizza bursting with flavor on a cracker thin crust.  I had the pork chops with a mushroom and artichoke heart sauce - YUM! WOW!  TASTEBUDGASMIC!  

We shared food, enjoyed our conversation without being hovered over.  Our servers came to the table exactly when we needed them - no more, no less.  If it hadn&#39;t been for the noisy family bouncing around in the booth behind me we would have lingered.  After being jammed in the back by a dad and a kid who couldn&#39;t manage to sit still, we decided to ask for the bill and get the included dessert to go.  (Note to hosts, hostesses, and others who seat restaurant customers - when a couple is having a romantic dinner, try to steer noisy people away from them and definitely do not seat them in the booth behind!)

We ordered the creme brulee and drove home, so completely happy with the meal and the service that it made up for the birthday/anniversary debacle.  When we got home and got into the creme brulee - MORE TASTEBUDGASMIC!!  

What a meal, and great experience!  :)  

When you go, one of the cool things you will notice is the menu - the standbys are in print but most of it was hand-written as the menu offerings change constantly at Francescas.  Ya gotta go!!!!  You cannot beat the customer service or the food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

We started with a modern take on a bruschetta that had grilled peach, mozerrella cheese, fresh basil, and a basalmic vinegar reduction.  

We both had a salmon dish, hers was more of a Madiera, and mine was more of a picatta with capers and lemon butter (yum).  

The bartender was a great one, very friendly, and came over and served us each a small glass of champagne, because he had heard from the manager that we were celebrating a special occasion.  

When it was all said and done, we felt like we were treated like royalty, and it was a very nice treat, since we do not get out too often, especially not to places like this. 

We will certainly be back to Francesca&#39;s, and have already given rave reviews to friends and family about it!"

Last time everything was perfect and were seated upstairs where quiet.  This time after explaining in detail why we needed a quiet location as special people in town after 10 yrs.  We were first in the restaurant and put in main room that filled with noisy people and could not talk at all and that was only time we would see them.   

Some dishes came out late and cold like they forgot to heat.  Pasta on a couple was sticky and balled up in chunks.  They took back but didn&#39;t return until the rest were finished, plates removed &amp; standing saying goodbyes, so took home.  

Felt very rushed and yes they take your food and unfinished cocktails if you don&#39;t watch.   They always pick it up too before asking if finished which should never happen.   They need to wait til plate is pushed back or ask in general is anyone finished with plates.  

Food is beyond excellent with large portions, when they get it right and a great place to go for special occasions."

The chicken was good and tender, overall good flavor.  I took off one star due to the steak meat. The Steak taco meat was over salted and although it was warm you can smell the &#34;cow type&#34; freshness in the meat. Typically in Mexican cooking more lime and seasonings are used to add a better flavor and aroma in the meat. The place was very clean and cashier was very prompt and attentive.
I would re-visit again.

Important to note:
There are  7 Mexican restaurants that I have counted on Irving park road between Bartlett Rd and slightly east of Barrington. I kind of wonder if most if the reviews here are for the correct restaurant ?  Overall this appears to be a clean establishment. I haven&#39;t seen them use a microwave."

We order take-out from there regularly, have never eaten-in. We usually get the burritos which are amazing!! The service is very good, but sometimes they have a hard time juggling the restaurant and the take-out cause the waitresses do it all! But the place is  very cute and always pretty fast, but definitely always tasty.

However, half of the times we&#39;ve been at the restaurant, my orders got messed up. The first time I ordered a combination meal and when the order came it was the wrong combo meal and I ate it only because it I waited a long time to get it. The next time I came my wife and I only ordered an enchilada platter and a chicken flautas platter. When we got the bill it seemed a little high and when I checked the receipt, we were charged for three platters with a chili rellanos on the bill which we didn&#39;t have.

I do not go there to eat flautas, hard-shelled tacos, burritos or other American inventions.

And that is why I like it.  They have an extensive menu of authentic Mexican dishes, most of them no one (unless you are into Mexican cuisine) has heard of and would probably not try.  Most of it, pretty good.

What&#39;s worse it that when I brought it in to tell them, they didn&#39;t seem at all concerned and said &#39;that will happen&#39;. Fine. I won&#39;t be back.
Also, they frequently get the order wrong, the staff is unhappy, orders take too long and the prices for the same order will vary. The prices are also too high for quality of food.
When they first opened the food was pretty good, but last time I went there it tasted like a lot of stale/spoiled ingredients were used.

But one thing has always been consistent and improving, their food.

No discredit to any burrito fans out there, but don&#39;t go to La Fogata to order something so generic you can find literally anywhere else.  Instead, opt to try of their many MANY specialties and you will be happy that you decided to take your taste buds for a ride.

I recommend just about anything on the menu, but I&#39;ll try to narrow it down to my favorites.

!) Tacos with Al Pastor Pork: Simply amazing.  It&#39;s a marinated pork that is spit-grilled with grilled onions and hints of pineapple.  The pork is so tender and flavorful, with just enough sauce and a slight hint of spice.  --FOR THE ADVENTUROUS DINER, try the cabeza or tongue tacos.  Cabeza is basically beef cheek meat that is a little fatty but super beefy tasting.  And tongue, well do I really need to explain it, if you&#39;ve never had beef tongue you should give it a try, it&#39;s super soft beefy goodness.

2) Mole de Olla: A traditional Mexican soup with a flavorful and spicy broth base.  Has a good variety of perfectly cooked veggies.  

3) Pambazo : This is straight of the streets of Mexico City.  It&#39;s a sandwich with chorizo (Mexican spicy sausage) and potatoes, topped with lettuce, sour cream and cheese, all in a traditional soft telera bread that has been dunked in a slightly spicy tomato sauce, and then grilled.  It sounds messy, and believe me it is super messy, you will have to eat this sandwich with a fork, but it is delicious!

4) Gorditas: Try the steak or chorizo gordita on this one.  It&#39;s basically a thick tortilla pocket stuffed with beans, cheese, and a topping of your choice.  It is crispy fried on the outside, and hot and melty on the inside.

5) Quesadillas:  This is a large thick tortilla, it tastes home-made but I&#39;m not sure, folded in half and filled with melted cheese and the topping of your choice and then grilled.  I recommend again the chorizo quesadilla.  FOR THE ADVENTUROUS DINER, definitely try the Huitlacoche quesadilla.  I have yet to see another restaurant offer this.  Huitlacoche is a corn fungus, yup you read that right, it&#39;s basically a Mexican truffle that is tastes earthy and mushroomy.  It is finely diced with grilled onions.  It might sound and look a little strange, but definitely worth trying.

6) And finally I&#39;ll recommend the Milanesa Torta.  It is a sandwich with a pieces of thin cut breaded steak topped with lettuce, tomato, avocado, cheese, onions, and sour cream, all inside a soft telera bun.  Basic, but very tasty.

Oh and it goes without saying that their Horchata (sweet rice drink) is delicious as well.

So to sum it up, try any one of my recommendations and you will get to experience a true taste of Mexico and what La Fogata is all about! :)"

i ended up with the shrimp burrito. the massive amount of choices was too much for me to handle. buuut, it was bomb. so amazing. perfectly cooked shrimp, guac inside, all sorts of flavors with every bite. ugh so good. normal burritos run for $4.75 (steal), shrimp was a little more pricey (~$9). the guac was different, the bf wasn&#39;t a fan, but i loved it. instead of the usual 90/10 ratio of avacado to tomatoes, it was more like 70/30. neither bland nor too salty, just right. they make it tableside too if you dine in!

if they can make a shrimp burrito THAT delicious, i can&#39;t wait to try everything else!"

I am a gringo, but my wife of over 5 years hails from the heart of Mexico, and she and her family have taught me much about REAL Mexican cooking.  So much for my qualifications.....

When it first opened, La Fogata immediately separated itself from the myriad burrito stands in the area by offering a wide variety of menu selections from the basics (tacos, etc.) to food which I had never heard of (huitlacoche quesadillas, hauraches, etc).   

The multitude of menu selections ensures that whether you are looking for just a quick snack or want to sit down with the family and enjoy a full dinner, you will not be disappointed. While the prices may be a bit higher on some items as compared to some of the &#34;$4.00 burrito special!&#34; joints, the superior quality of food at La Fogata is well worth it.

The quality of the meals served on every visit is consistently delicious, and I can honestly say that there has never been a meal in my many, many visits that has disappointed me (though there have been some that made my eyes water!)

Standout selections include the huitlacoche (corn mushroom) quesadilla, the pechuga Fogata (seared chicken breast &amp; poblano peppers in cream sauce), and chilequiles (tortilla chips simmered in salsa).

While the restaurant is not very big, the space is well used so it is cozy by not cramped. The dining area and bathrooms are always clean. Waitstaff have always been pleasant and attentive.

If you are looking for authentic Mexican recipes which are well-prepared with quality ingredients, then La Fogata is definitely the place to go.  If your definition of &#34;Mexican food&#34; equals &#34;cheap burrito&#34;, then I encourage you to broaden your horizons and learn what real Mexican cooking is all about - and if you still only want a burrito, the Burrito Fogata will be the best you have ever eaten!!"

I&#39;ve been here a couple of times already and the quality of the food is great. I have most often order tortas, but this time, I ordered a flor de calabaza quesadilla, and let me tell you it did not disappoint. In fact, this was the best item I&#39;ve had at this restaurant, and that is because the tortillas are handmade and the flavor of it is very authentic. Also, the quesadilla was perfect not lacking cheese neither was loaded with cheese. Every bite of it satisfied my taste buds. The only down side to the restaurant was the little towel where they bring you the tortillas in which my mom had because she ordered menudo. The towels are dirty and don&#39;t seem to be washed daily. So if you&#39;re considering to eat here and order a plate that involves tortillas tell them to bring it to you in napkins or paper towels instead their nice knit towels."

We stopped in one night for the first time. We enjoy Mexican food and wanted to try this place. Our first Impression was that as we were the only none Latino customers in the place we were made to feel uncomfortable. We frequent a couple of Mexican restaurants where this is common place and we have fun with it as do the owners and patrons. I think it is a compliment to the restaurant to want to experience this. Not the case here. We just wanted a nice dinner. From the waitress to the guys behind the counter to several of the patrons it was clear to us that a message was being sent. I will give credit based on the food and not the way we were made to feel. The food for us was as bland as the way we were treated. No thanks!

The food is much better. I&#39;m hooked on their beef res (beef soup). It&#39;s a great deal. For only $9 you get a huge server of beef soup with large chunks of meat, vegetables with a side of rice and tortillas!

I had this misfortune of ordering from this particular Jimmys on 2 occasions. The first time we experienced Jimmys, our order was horribly incorrect.  Due to the fact that we ordered Carry-Out, we didnt realize the order was incorrect until we started ooening the containers.  We ordered a Family meal with 2 quartered chickens, fettucini alfredo and mash potatoes and gravy.   Upon opening we discovered our chickens weren&#39;t quartered, no big deal just an annoyance.  We then opened something i would call mostaccoli alfredo.  No fettucini? Lastly, we did not receive any gravy for our orders of mashed potatoes.  At this point, it wasn&#39;t feasible for us to go back, so instead we called and spoke with the manager Tom.  He was very empathetic and offered us very generous gift cards and he delivered them personally to us.  I felt extremely satisfied and vowed to give them another chance.  I was told they had only recently moved a bit further up Devon, so i chalked the experience up to &#34;the move.&#34;   Mistakes happen.

Well, we waited a while to allow them the opportunity to get situated and such before ordering again.  A few weeks went by and we decided to order from them again (yesterday.)  We placed our order with a lady named Helen.  We asked Helen to repeat our order to confirm everything was correct.  She repeated the order perfectly and, given our past experience, we figured all would be in order this time around. We picked up the order and proceeded back.  We were celebrating a co-workers retirement so we wanted everything to be nice and smooth.  You can&#39;t imagine how incredulous we were to find some of the same glaring errors as before!  No fettucini,  only &#34;mostaccoli alfredo.&#34; No gravy for the 4 or 5 orders of mashed potatoes.  The chickens were quartered this time, thankfully.  We made the best of a bad situation and improvised the best we could.  Of course we were chagrined when we heard repeated requests for gravy.  We also had to field a lot of questions regarding, &#34;whats that mostaccoli dish called?&#34;  Not a fine dining experience whatsoever.

We called amd spoke with the same lady that took our order originally.  Frankly, it seemed she couldn&#39;t care any less.  She stated, &#34;We dont have fettucini alfredo..., ...our mashed potatoes don&#39;t come with gravy (cereal no milk?).. you can come pick up some gravy.&#34;  Absolutely unacceptable. Highly incompetent and unempathetic staff. She seemed unconcerned and even bothered by our complaint.  Mind you, we maintained absolute professionalism and courtesy while interacting with her.  Her responses weren&#39;t a result of an unreasonable or beligerent customer. She seemed to want to say &#34;is that all u called for? i got work to do.&#34; We pointed out that we spoke to her originally and that she repeated our order to us twice.  Why didnt she say anything about gravy not being included with mash potatoes (what respectable restaurant does that?) Why didnt she advise they dont offer any fettucini alfredo?  The reason she didnt do this is because she simply didnt care and lacks professionalism. 

We did not bother escalating any further to Tom, although perhaps we should have, but no matter the conversation or offers, we will never visit this place again, nor will we allow our family and friends to support this place.  Had they delivered quality and accurate service, they would have earned increased business and promotion from our work group. 

For REAL Jimmys Charhouse i suggest visiting the one in Elgin.  The one in Elk Grove is the one to avoid."

I was more in it for the networking than the dining, but that soon changed. 
Our shuttle bus dropped us off and I was surprised to find that at 8 pm on a Saturday night they weren&#39;t too busy.  The staff there is very friendly as everyone who walked past greeted us.  Their menu has something for everyone and I chose the filet medallions trio, excellent pick.  The pieces were very tender and flavorful.  I don&#39;t drink but others on my table said the wine list was impressive and the waiter really seemed to know his pairings.  I would eat here again when I&#39;m back in the area."

I would avoid the desserts as they are very generic and don&#39;t taste homemade at all. The salad was great, I love their balsamic dressing. Mashed potatoes and steak fries both rock. Steak itself was just ok. At least I could cut through it easily! And their side veggies are always yummy! It makes for a decent work lunch, but I wouldn&#39;t go back for any other occasion."

Menu choices were very limited, service and food were bland. Menu could use a lot of work. Nothing stood out that would prompt our group of 16 to return. Charhouse should indicate a great choice of grilled meat cuts, but the menu is more like a typical Greek or Denny&#39;s dinner menu. More salads, sandwiches and chicken breast meals.
Lots of potential for this restaurant since location is par."

This is a nicely decorated place and definitely looks like a charhouse. We sat near the kitchen but it wasn&#39;t too loud and it was interesting to see the cooks work. The drink menu is ok, not great. The food menu is much better. They have the typical apps, salads, chicken, fish, beef, pastas. We started with the potato skins. The portion size is insane! they gave us like 3 whole potatoes! And they were well made. I ordered the chicken piccatta special and my table also ordered a steak and the pork chops. All the meats were cooked very well, and the potatoes and beans that came with each plate were nicely done as well. The bill was very reasonable considering alcohol, appetizer and the portion sizes of the entrees. It&#39;s a good place to hit if you are in the area."

Ordered Beef Barley Soup (excellent); Blackened Salmon (possibly frozen) was below average when it was always much better in the past--lacked flavor and seasoning (price increased by the way), Mashed Potatoes, Veggie was Green Beans.  Spouse ordered Chopped Steak which was excellent, Mashed Potatoes, Veggie was Green Beans and Beef Barley Soup.  The Mashed Potatoes were terrible and they were not whipped and fluffy and also tasted full of margarine instead of butter.  There was definitely a change with the potatoes.  Also, there was no live music this evening either so we don&#39;t know what happened.  Service was good tonight although they were not very busy.

I came from the far south side of Chicago  (50 miles), so when I pulled in and saw a different name, I was worried.  
The folks at the front desk said they would honor it. Cool.
The decor is classic upscale steakhouse,  not old looking or anything,  but just nice. A little darkly lit for lunch time,  though. 
My server was polite and had good timing (there when you need him, not obtrusive when you&#39;re eating).
I ordered a 22 oz. Rib eye bone-in, mashed potatoes,  a chowder soup and wedge salad. 
The soup was terrific, flavorful and had enough seafood taste without being overbearing. 
The wedge salad was BIG! Bacon bits, Bleu cheese crumbled on it, a hard boiled egg  and Bleu cheese dressing. 
Garlic croutons would have elevated either soup or salad, but the were both great tasting dishes.
The main course came and it looked and smelled wonderful. The classic char smell, beautiful look on the plate. The steak tasted every bit as fantastic as it looked. Potatoes and sauted green beans... just great.

The Food:
I&#39;ve been here on weekends and weeknights. I&#39;ve been here for Valentines day. I&#39;ve had private parties here.  The food is just....eh.  It&#39;s basically a classed up standard greek diner.  The steaks are not Prime and I would question even Choice.  They&#39;re not bad, but they can be dry (especially on the outside) and lacking flavor. Not nearly enough salt on them prior to cooking which makes for a dry crust.

Other food is a little better than your average Greek run family style restaurant.  It&#39;s not a bad place, but you&#39;re paying Wildfire prices for about two steps down in quality and maybe three or four down in flavor.  It seems like they&#39;re stuck on Greek inspired family recipes and don&#39;t really have any POW on the plate.

But it&#39;s not bad and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m getting ripped off.  For us, we go there when we can&#39;t get reservations elsewhere.

the Bar:

Love the bar.  Good drinks and a fun crowd, although on the older end of the spectrum.  Great people watching for middle agers like us, but I think a younger crowd would feel like they&#39;re seeing Grandma dancing at the bar.  Very fun time for us though, we always end up having fun conversations with random people and the live entertainment is a blast.

So, in short...

It&#39;s not a BAD place for a date night dinner, but I wouldn&#39;t take your girlfriend there to propose nor would I say it&#39;s your &#34;once in a life time&#34; date night. It&#39;s not bad for your kids first communion party or a nice meal out with the kids.  I don&#39;t think patrons would be offended by children and it&#39;s spacious enough where you can request a secluded area if you&#39;re planning for the worst with them."

It was almost 10 minutes before anyone came to ask us for drinks.  We ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer and there were no tenticles...very disappointing because that&#39;s the best part. I ordered the lamb chops and everything was less than room temperature. Nothing was hot. I think the mashed potatoes were from a box...very loose. A couple of pieces of broccoli and some carrot chunks. The salad looked old. My husband ordered the prime rib that came with a baked potato to go. The meat was raw and cold too. I asked for the Bernaise sauce on the side and that was fine. Took the carrot cake to go and ate that later. That was very moist! Great.
Awesome waitress personality wise but the food was very disappointing. Jimmys charhouse has been in business for many years so I thought it would be a perfect place to go. How can u go wrong with lamb chops at a Greek restaurant but I guess u can. Very disappointed. Can I get a refund please?!"

It&#39;s switched hands twice since then. Every time it does, the food gets a bit worse. Went on Saturday night for a good steak. Place was dead. Used to have to wait a good 45 minutes to get in, that should have told me something.  Waiter was attentive, soup and salad were fine. Bread was good. I had the prime rib. Worst prime rib I&#39;ve ever had. Tough and chewy, no flavor. My husband had the $26 New York Strip, also not very good. Honestly, a few weeks ago I went to LongHorn and the steak was to die for and it was half the price! Skip this place, you can get better steak elsewhere.

Food and service was always great then. Well I went last night with work people and friends to a retirement party.  The service was not good. You walk in the door and their is just a bunch of people standing at the hostess station.  No hi no anything.  Food horrible. Me and another co worker got the Ruben.... All fat no kraut regular 1000 island dressing out of a bottle.  My husband and a co worker of mine got the cheeseburger. I&#39;ve seen Portillos plated better on a cheeseburger.  The other people got steaks.  None of which were cooked to what they were asked to be cooked at. Then when server brought food out, he brought no condiments. So everytime someone needed something, that should have been brought out in the first place, they would have to ask. Lets see alcoholic beverages.............no consistency what so ever.  It is a shame that this place turned into this from Charlies.  Real disappointment.

*Ultimate Seafood Terriyaki entree is well executed &amp; a great value
*Rock star parking and no wait to be seated at 8PM Thursday 

MISSES - 
*Charging $1.85 for hot tea per person is a bit much (should be free)
*Spicy tuna roll had a weird tasting red spice (shoulda been a slam dunk)
*Server dude was aloof at first but warmed up to us later  
*Miso soup was just okay, my 11 year old says she&#39;s had better
*Fried rice upgrade should be $1, not $2"

I think that the soup and salad are smaller. Our tempura entree dish was decorated with an orchid. Our plate with our sushi was decorated with some orchid leaves. The interior decorations are more modern than before. I would come back to try the lunch buffet. It is $15 per person. There is a special menu that you order from. The catch is that you pay for whatever food you don&#39;t eat. This seems like a good way to try a lot of single pieces if sushi.

I&#39;ve driven past several times and thought, &#34; need to try this place&#34; and I am glad I did.  It is very welcoming.  The service was excellent and my favorite part---CLEAN.  Seriously, I have walked out of more restaurants lately because they look like they haven&#39;t seen a mop or dust cloth is weeks.

Lest I digress, on to the food.  We were super hungry so we ordered 4 rolls for the two of us.  Usually we don&#39;t have a problem, but these rolls were nicely filled and the portions were very generous.  the tempura veggie appetizer and miso soup before hand may have had something to do with it.  

One of the rolls was not to our liking and the owner/manager (?) noticed it right away and asked if she could please make us something else.  There was nothing wrong with the roll, it just was not something we enjoyed like we thought we would.  She was so apologetic and eager to replace or remove the item from our bill.  She made us a small sample platter and it was amazing.  Seriously she did not have to do this, as I said there was nothing wrong with the roll, it was US. 

The platter was equally amazing and the fact that they were concerned with a customer not being satisfied was even more amazing.

Wow customer service????  Great food! Good prices! They have my business, and I will be back!"

I noticed all the wonderful reviews for  Sake Sushi, we tried it. I&#39;m still relatively new to the whole sushi thing, so I was nervous - I shouldn&#39;t have been! 

I know, it&#39;s next to a Walmart in a tiny strip mall, but the sushi was amazing!!! It&#39;s BYOB (which we haven&#39;t taken advantage of yet), and the first time we easily managed to spend $120 on sushi and a bottle of sake. We ended up ordering 4 - 5 rolls a piece and a couple for takeout for his twin, because it was SO GOOD! We went back a week or so later with the brother, and spend $104. 

My favorite were there Jalapeno Popper Roll (it was a special - they&#39;re only on the board when you walk in, so make sure you look!), and the Caribbean roll. My boyfriend liked the Spider roll (which was good) and the Dragon roll. Really, there were so many that were good it&#39;s hard to remember and make distinctions. There was only one I didn&#39;t like, and it was one that Curtis loved, so go figure. I LOVED their Miso soup - one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. It was amazing. I also ordered the Cucumber Salad, and it was exquisite. Writing this review is make me hunger for it right now. 

Both the nights I went, it was relatively quiet - we were surprised. However, a number of people did come in for takeout during our stay each time. The decor is nice and modern, very pretty and lovely. I could spend probably $20, or $50 per person, it all depends on what you&#39;re hungry for and what you feel like ordering (some rolls are more expensive that others). 

I can&#39;t wait to come back again and again and again and again and again... I just need to make sure my boyfriend isn&#39;t SUPER hungry first so I can afford to, I could easily spend $75 hear for the two of us each time, haha."

Don&#39;t let the outside fool you- it&#39;s a great place!  The outside makes it look small and kind of bland, but don&#39;t judge a book by its cover!  The inside is very warm and inviting.

sake-sushi-and-grill-lake-zurich,Mal C.,lfndLWaP6FS_nSkAq8UAlA,"Boulder, CO",0,1,0,0,2,uobljPYUYxE8hFg2buvzIg,5.0,2016-01-05,"My family has been coming here since day 1 of Sake&#39;s opening and I have yet to be disappointed. 

Atmosphere: really great except for the music. Just doesn&#39;t match the vibes of a sushi place very well. I&#39;ve also heard from some people that they think the wait staff is cold. I disagree wholeheartedly. Their culture might not be exactly the same as ours, making them act differently as wait staff than we would. I find them to be delightful and appreciate the extra touch of culture the wait staff puts into this place. 

Food: AMAZING! Well worth everything. Even the sh** music (but you can carry out if it&#39;s that unbearable for you). I&#39;m almost embarrassed as to how much I come here, but I dream about their sushi. The fish is very fresh and it&#39;s a thick cut, which I like a lot. I always get the salmon and white tuna sushi (the meat with just rice) and it&#39;s to die for. I&#39;ve tried sushi in multiple places in the US and abroad and this is hands down my favorite place. The owner&#39;s husband owns a fishing company (or industry?) and obviously gives his wife the cream of the crop. As at any sushi place, taste and flavor can vary depending on the fish, which makes it so genuine! Sometimes I like the white tuna and other times it&#39;s lost some flavor. But the salmon is consistently AMAZING. They also have tons of rolls if you&#39;re into that. I love the jalapeño popper, which they recently just added to the menu. Just enough spicy (and I normally don&#39;t like spicy). While they did recently change the menu, they have not changed owners as another reviewer believed. Winnie is still the owner, but she isn&#39;t there as often. I actually rarely see her these days. The chefs are still the same, but there are more. The place has EXPLODED for good reason and they needed additional chefs and wait staff. Luckily I&#39;m very accepting of change, unlike the other reviewer, and I embraced this necessary change. I have not seen any drop in quality with their changes. Must have just been bad timing for the reviewer since the fish can vary slightly since all the sushi doesn&#39;t come from one fish. 

Also! Gluten free! I have an allergy and they&#39;ve been very accommodating. They have gluten free soy sauce (just ask!) and they have plenty of options on the menu. They might not be super knowledgable though about that so I&#39;d say avoid spicy tuna, crab, mystery sauces, any &#39;crunch&#39; and obviously tempura. But I&#39;ve never asked because I always get just sushi so they may know more than I think! I&#39;m only assuming because there&#39;s a slight language barrier. 

Cheers and enjoy this incredible sushi place! Did I mention it&#39;s BYOB?! Winning."

I also didn&#39;t recognize any of the sushi chefs. I used to be a regular when they first opened and there was one chef that used to greet me, we&#39;re both Chinese and spoke Cantonese, so it was nice talking to someone who spoke the same dialect. I never caught his name but I think he was the owner. He is probably gone now because the sushi was really good back then.

Now, omg, I took my boyfriend here a couple days ago and ordered from the lunch special........this was the worst sushi I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Everything was not fresh, fish, rice, seaweed, EVERYTHING. You can get better sushi at Jewel or at Marianos. It will cost more then $15 but their sushi tastes like gold compared to this place. I don&#39;t understand how they have more business now. If you guys want quality sushi in the area, go to Sushi Kushi in Lake Zurich, its near Sonic and Bellalukes, right next to All Ways Healthy and that vacuum place that no one ever goes into."

So when I saw a little strip mall sushi place along Rand Rd (just south of Walmart and Costco), I reluctantly recommended it for lunch today. Guess what? Everyone else on Yelp was right! Sake Sushi and Grill is definitely a gem.

The inside is nicely decorated with modern finishes. The servers and staff are friendly with smiles on their faces. We ordered the Roll Special lunch, Hot Bowl lunch special, and a shrimp tempura appetizer.  The lunch specials come with both house salad and miso soup.  The salad dressing is one of the best ginger citrus dressings I&#39;ve had. It had a good flavor and just the right balance of sweet and savory.  Miso soup is good. The fish is fresh. Portions are nicely sized. Lunch special prices are great. Rice is not overly seasoned or overpowering. Fabulous overall!"

We walked into this place just wanting to try somewhere new. Admittedly we were surprised at first by how modern it was inside - the decor was great and still offered the environment I&#39;m looking for when I go out for sushi. 

When we sat down to look at the menu, it was kind of small. We ordered a sushi combination and a roll to start. WOW! The sushi tasted so fresh and clean. We instantly fell in love. 

Then we tried the roll and oh my. We ordered the Caribbean Roll. The minute I put it in my mouth I think I died and went to heaven and then reincarnated just to put another piece in my mouth. Seriously, it was that good. It was the perfect combination of crunchy, spicy, and sweet. 

After telling our server how much we loved it, she gave us a recommendation for the Orange Flamingo Roll. That was equally as amazing. Again, perfectly crunchy and perfectly spicy. 

Needless to say, I left very happy. The only thing I wish this place did different was Maki combinations. But it was very affordable and very delicious. If you&#39;re looking for an awesome, low-key sushi place I highly recommend!"

Not in a highly visible spot, tucked off Rand road in a strip center, I was hesitant to try it but all the good reviews here lured me in...and happily so!

Nice, clean decor and friendly staff greeted me.  Ordered the calamari to start and it was fresh with a light tempura-like batter.  Tried a daily special roll, &#34;jalapeño popper&#34; and it was heavenly with super fresh tuna, salmon, avocado and little rings of jalapeño.

After we tried the food, we can&#39;t wait to go back.  The coconut shrimp was fantastic.  So good, it was almost hard to believe.  The list of rolls was endless.  Plus they had nightly specials in addition to the full menu.  Our favorite of the night was the jalapeno popper roll but it was a tough call.  They were extremely slow the night we were there so the service was extra attentive but they all seemed really nice and knowledgeable so I imagine they&#39;re always that good."

Agree with some of the other reviews, you have to get past the fact that it&#39;s in a strip mall by Walmart. Sushi is fantastic, great flavors, friendly and attentive service. I believe it&#39;s BYOB too, which is always a plus! We have been there twice now. Really good sushi, but the first time was quite a bit better than the first, but I think that&#39;s because of what rolls we ordered. Texture was just... Not what we were expecting.

The Teri chicken looked (and tasted) like it was boiled and then sauced and had a heavy onion flavor, the shrimp tempura was more like ebi-fry and definitley not tempura batter. If you want decent fried shrimp order their Tempura - if you want Tempura eat somewhere else.

The biggest issue I had was with the (Nigiri) sushi. The fish was OK and was a good portion size in relation to the rice. It was the low grade rice that was not prepared very well at all. It was undercooked, dry and flavorless. I&#39;m not a sushi snob and will happily eat at cheap sushi places but don&#39;t care for improperly prepared food.

Our party also had the Tuna Tataki which was good and a roll of some sort which also had rice issues. The salad included with the meals was standard Japanese restaurant fare and the miso was actually pretty good.

The staff was concerned because we didn&#39;t eat too much of our meals and we declined to comment since our dislike for the food is largely subjective and the other patrons seemed to be enjoying what they were eating."

This place is pretty new, I&#39;ve been there for lunch and dinner, and it&#39;s really good.  Very nice people as well.

My faves are the &#34;hot bowl,&#34; slices of salmon, tuna, scallop, octopus, tossed in a spicy sauce. As an appetizer for dinner it comes on a bed of finely sliced  cucumber. As a lunch special, they serve it on rice. it&#39;s sushilicious. There&#39;s a nice sushi and sashimi dish that hits the spot and a seared tuna that&#39;s really nice too. The teriyaki salmon comes a bit over-teriyaki&#39;d and a bit sweet, but nonetheless a good choice.

Good variety and generous portions in the lunch specials, rapidly becoming one of my favorite lunch spots. 

The place is a treat and I&#39;m very glad I found them. You will be too if you make it over there.

My sister got chicken with peapods and water chestnuts, her go to.  It had that strange smell to it and no flavor what so ever.  If it didn&#39;t have the peapods, it would have had no color to it, just white.  

I had the Gilbert special.  I couldn&#39;t tell which meat was pork and which was beef.  Just an unidentifiable mess.

Their egg rolls and fried wontons are wonderful, I&#39;ve searched high and low to find ones that compare but my search has been fruitless so far. My other loves are the pork fried rice and the egg food young. If you get the chance to try this place do yourself a favor and please do so!"

All oil and cabbage. If you stick with the rice dishes U will be ok but it&#39;s way over priced.

I, myself, have been getting Gilberts take out for over 20 years. When I moved away, it was the first thing I asked to eat for dinner when I visited home. Currently, I live several miles away from West Dundee and every time we drive to pick up our food from Gilberts Kitchen, we pass several &#39;average&#39; Chinese food restaurants on our way, knowing that the few extra miles are well worth the above average quality Chinese food. Even when the owners would close shop for a few weeks and raise prices upon their return every year, we would continue to order from Gilberts because knew that the food was worth the extra money. With that said, I was very saddened to hear that the management had changed (?) and I was in denial when I read the recent Yelp reviews claiming that Gilberts had taken a turn for the worst. Although I was leery, I still placed a large order with a wide variety of food to accommodate 9 family members (my uncle was visiting from California and had specifically requested  Gilberts).  It is my great displeasure to announce that the other yelp reviews with poor ratings are indeed correct. Gone are the days of quality ingredients. Fresh arrays of vegetables and different kinds of mushrooms are now lacking from their dishes, replaced with typical cheap vegetables. Their fantastic giant shrimp and pork egg rolls are smaller and are now filled with only shredded cabbage as far as I could see. Their jumbo chicken nuggets are more like chicken tenders from Chilis. Instead of being the Gilberts Kitchen with exceptional quality that brought people from near and far, new management has dumbed it down to &#39;just another Chinese take out place&#39;. It is officially the end of an era and this makes me very sad. From now on, I will save the gas money and time and get my Chinese take out from somewhere closer to home."

I have my staples that I order and have never been disappointed. Please understand though that if you order the egg rolls, they are meal. They are the size of a small burrito. Not joking.
It&#39;s standard Chinese take-out fare. There is no delivery option so be prepared to pick up your order. It&#39;s never terribly busy so the wait time to pick-up is usually no longer than 30 minutes. Obviously, it is busier on the weekends than during the week so keep that in mind."

The portions were ridiculously huge and the Mongolian Chicken was to die for. They used really good chicken and big pieces of green onions in it and their fried rice was excellent too.  It had been a while since we had been to Gilbert&#39;s kitchen and we got some take out tonight and it was the worse Chinese food I ever had.  The chicken was cheap and rubbery and the flavor was horrible tasting. It was almost like they took a bunch of leftover chicken and vegetables from other pots and added some Mongolian sauce on top and gave it to us.  Also the receipt I got has Ou&#39;s Pro-Wok on it even though the sign over the door says Gilbert&#39;s Kitchen.

The huge eggrolls that made this place famous are gone. They are now 1/3 the size that they used to be. Where they used to be full of pork and shrimp there was only cabbage.

Over the years, I have seen their overall quality go down a bit. Their prices have risen, they charge you for extra condiments, and there is more filler in mixed dishes. My beef and broccoli has become 30% onions. They really aren&#39;t bad and I have to agree the eggrolls are the best (probably worst for you), but they are definitely becoming more average.

The portions have shrunk, the quality of the food has declined and the prices have gone up.  

I ordered lunch there today and got a measly portion of Mongolian beef, a small scoop of fried rice and an egg roll that was no larger than my pinky finger.   Completely disappointing on all counts.  

I will definitely be exploring other Chinese carry-out locations in the area.  Hong Kong Chef just up the street has Gilbert&#39;s over the barrel."

When it comes to their food, they don&#39;t skimp. Their egg rolls are huge. The other portions are amazing. The flavor of their food is fantastic. This is one of the best take out Chinese places there is. Of course, they only have one table, so eating there isn&#39;t the best option. 

What really stands out is their Wonton Soup. Unlike most restaurants that give you dish water with noodles and some green onions, Gilberts actually puts a ton of stuff in theirs. What separates theirs is not just the taste, but the amount of pork they put in it. I swear, they take a rib and just slice it up. It is amazing. The Wonton Soup itself is a meal, and well worth it.

Gilberts is also affordable. I started going here as a kid in the mid-80s and the restaurant hasn&#39;t changed a bit."

Folks rating food and service based on one interaction taken in or out of context?  Are we dealing with someone who prefers road kill over filet mignon?  The concept sounded odd to me.  I get it now.  I signed up because a beloved restaurant has been thrown away.  It inspired me to become &#39;one of those people&#39; who has to pronounce their extreme distaste.  Been going to Gilberts since I was a kid.  I still try to find excuses to go there, though it is an hour away from my home now.  New ownership/management/cook, whatever.  This place is now serving hot garbage.  Good news is, at least it is hot.  I&#39;ve read a few reviews from years past, and I get it- everyone has a different idea of good Chinese food.  If you want the standard fare achieved by pouring soy sauce over a food product and calling it Asian cuisine- congratulations!  You have now found the place!  I can also recommend the BEST burger in the world at a place with golden arches.  Travel 3 miles and you are sure to bump into one!  Mmmm-mmm, good.  I&#39;m trying to understand the business plan for this new owner/manger.  You bought something that worked for DECADES.  Your investment was not the building (sure it is a lease), nor a customer list.  You bought equipment and recipes.  Why you would choose to only use the equipment (and use it for evil) dumbfounds me.  Sell me the recipe portion since you aren&#39;t using it.  Mongolian Beef at this place was unique- until recently.  Argue as you see fit- but the recipe was different.  Dark brown, spicy sauce that clung to the beef and green onions.  Now, it is the standard over-cooked, spongy, thick slice beef, smothered in onions and green onions (which, as you don&#39;t seem to realize, waters down the simple version of a sauce you attempt to use).  Thank you for saving me the gas money and time so I don&#39;t have to drive a long way for mediocrity.  My small town has better Asian food now- and that is nothing to shout about.  Heck, Panda Express is haute cuisine compared to the stuff I tried choking down from the &#39;new&#39; Gilbert&#39;s.  It is depressing to see this place go down like that.  Let me know when you sell off that equipment too- I need a seasoned wok at home."

The egg rolls are TO DIE FOR,  the Pork Fried Rice, General Tso&#39;s Chicken, POT STICKERS (!!!), Crab Rangoon, Mongolian Beef... all awesome!

The other things we&#39;ve tried from beef to chicken to seafood ranged from OK to poor. It ain&#39;t cheap either, so you don&#39;t want it to be hit and miss.

However, I&#39;d rather get less food that is more interesting. Quality from a perspective as it was clean, fresh etc. was fine, but there were far too many onions, sprouts and other &#34;cheap&#34; ingredients and most of the ingredients I am used to in Chinese food were missing. 

I got the veggie moo shu and the chow fun. Both were greasy and largely flavorless. The plum sauce was bland too and there were more sprouts in the chow fun than noodles.

Became very flavorful once the included ginger sauce is added - and ginger sauce helped cut the grease, making it more palatable to me.   (Husband loved the grease - so it&#39;s personal taste I guess.)  Egg roll alone is a meal.   I had (small) wonton soup (enough for 2)  and egg roll and that was all I could manage.  Wonton soup was enjoyable.
Tasted Beef Chow Mein - had an odd taste I didn&#39;t enjoy.  Also tasted Orange Chicken - it&#39;s spicier (hot) than other restaurants in the area - it was ok.  Husband, who loves orange chicken was unexcited by it.
Service was great.  Very friendly and kind.
Would we go back?  It&#39;s out of the way for us, so only if we happened to be driving by (unlikely) and were craving asian at that moment.

It was by far the best Chinese take out in the area. While it was not very close to our house for takeout, it was well worth it. We even bought catering trays of food for parties from them it was that good. We used to go to them all the time but over the past couple of years have been going less and less. The quality of the food has been declining as well as taste. The last time we went will be the last time-worst experience with them ever!. Take-out bill was over $50.00 which we never this high before. Wife ordered a chicken dish and asked it not to be spicy. It was so spicy, she could not eat it. I even had a hard time with it. I ordered Mongolian Beef. It is always served with those white rice noodles to go under it. I did not get the noodles, so the dish was incomplete as it needs this to soak up the sauce and flavor. I called them about this and was told they stopped including noodles with this over  a year ago and they don&#39;t have them anymore. Not true, it hasn&#39;t been a year since I got them last. I then was handed to someone else over the phone and the story changed to if you want them, you have specifically ask for them and pay $2.00 extra for a small bag of noodles which probably cost them 25 cents. If they are now serving a dish which is missing an important component to it, you would think they would let you know. Just another way to jack of the price. If that wasn&#39;t bad enough, the meat was like shoe leather. In the past it would be very tender, now it hurts you jaw you have to chew this leather so much. Obviously, they are using much cheaper cuts of meat. Our kid got cashew chicken which used to be very good. The stuff they gave us had almost no cashews, was very dark looking and not very good at all. My wife and kid ended up eating almost none of this $50.00 feast at all. I had to finish all of their food over the next week as lunch leftovers, and no it did not improve with age. Also, ordered bbq pork fried rice. Instead, they gave us beef fried rice which we do not like and was not very good. When I called to complain about this as well, they only said that someone else had the same thing happen to them, Tough luck was the attitude, not we will give you a credit or replace it. The only good thing was the egg rolls, they continue to be the some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. I know the ownership has not changed, it&#39;s the same guy at the front for the past 10 years. He has just decided to save money by cutting the quality of the food and jacking up the prices and charging for what should be free. Didn&#39;t even get the damn fortune cookies they used to include in all orders. Felt totally ripped off and got no apology&#39;s for screwing up the order. Never going back.

The portions here are huge, they have to staple to tops of their cartons together!  The wontons are yum, I have never found a wonton anywhere else that actually has meat in them.  The chicken for the sweet and sour is HUGE and juicy, the egg foo young is AWESOME, especially if you ask for it well done.

P.S.  I&#39;m not sure what the first reviewer means by &#34;There&#39;s not nearly enough room to sit down and eat if there are more then 2 people.&#34;   Gilberts is carryout only.  The table, chair and couch are for people waiting for pickup."

So, of course, I just had to try it!  It is carry-out only, as others have said, and since we didn&#39;t have a menu handy, we just went there and ordered and waited for our food.  We ordered a small order of Mongolian Beef (because a large was like $15.95), large Beef Chop Suey, Pot Stickers and Egg Rolls.  The only thing negative I would say about this place is the high prices for some of the entrees.  Everything else is very reasonably priced but I really don&#39;t understand charging $15.95 for a large anything at a Chinese take-out place.  But, of course, that is just my opinion.  Anyways, back to the food, and that...VERY GOOD!  The Mongolian Beef was definitely the best out here in the Elgin area and same with the Egg Rolls!  OMG...the egg rolls!

We had never had Chop Suey before so I have nothing to compare it to but it was tasty, the only bad thing about it was it used canned mushrooms, and that is a BIG no no in my book.  But it really didn&#39;t stop me from eating it so it must have been pretty good, right?! =]  Overall, I will definitely be making the extra 15 minute trip out here to get my Chinese food from now on...it was just that good!"

Simple menu, with dishes divided by sweet and savory.

My wife and I are vegetarian. We are from out of town and were here visiting family. They had heard of this restaurant and figured we&#39;d be great people to try it out with. All five of us really enjoyed our meals. (My uncle even commented how the restaurant could appeal to meat eaters, even though there&#39;s no meat.)

We&#39;ll definitely come back to this restaurant everytime we visit."

Well, today was finally that day. Before getting my groceries, my boyfriend and I decided to stop for a quick cup of coffee or small breakfast. 

Upon walking in, I was pleasantly surprised by the decor and how chic the place was. It&#39;s modern, yet very homey. I was excited to see we were not the only customers there either. Given the hidden location, I wondered whether enough people would notice it was even there. 

I&#39;m not vegetarian or vegan, but I loved how healthy everything on the menu seemed. I ordered a cup of coffee and we decided to split an order of the berry crepes... Not the healthiest item on the menu, but it sounded too good to pass up. We both loved them and would definitely order them again. It wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly sweet and you could tell they used fresh, real ingredients. 

This feels like the perfect place I could go eat out and order healthy without having to either 1) break the bank  or 2) settle for an underwhelming salad or grilled chicken breast. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because the menu was pretty small, but given the size of the cafe, I understand why. Though, I do think they should add a Bloody Mary to their cocktail list!

I&#39;ll definitely be back for lunch or dinner sometime soon!"

The food is wonderful, full of flavor, and the service is attentive and friendly. The menu is completely vegetarian but don&#39;t be scared off by that if you are a carnivore. My buckwheat cakes provided good substance that is sometimes missing without the dense protein of meat. 

The only notes when we visited ... They were out of numerous things on the menu. Maybe pays to ask when you sit down if there are things that aren&#39;t really available. That will keep you from making a disappointing choice."

It seems to be very Eastern European focused, which doesn&#39;t really go with the rest of the theme of the place at all. I don&#39;t really care, because the food is good.

What sucks is for kids - there are no highchairs. So good luck if your kid runs around. I didn&#39;t bother asking if there was a booster.

That said, the food is absolutely excellent - even if the menu is a bit limited in it&#39;s selection. I had a great appetizer that was basically julienned carrots and zucchini made into a rollup stuffed with ricotta. They also kept that same theme with the main course - which also included a julienned cucumber made into a little circular &#34;pot&#34; to hold a small salad to go with the lentils we ordered. 

All in all the food is pretty good, but this place is genuinely pricey. I&#39;m actually a bit surprised/saddened that for all the fanciness that goes into good visual presentation for relatively simple recipes, it doesn&#39;t make up for that their entire tea selection was from whole foods/world market. Granted this may not be the same as Billy Corgan&#39;s Madame Zuzu&#39;s tea house, but c&#39;mon guys. Don&#39;t try to sell us your tea like it&#39;s something special/worth extra when we basically have your entire tea selection in our pantry already. I say this as someone who&#39;s not even vaguely a tea snob - and yet they missed common tea like earl grey. The teas were way overpriced for a world market selection.

If this is what $15-18 plates cost, I think either this restaurant is all over the place or simply overcharges for everything. I mean the lentil main course had probably 2 cups of dried lentils (so easily 3+ cups cooked). I love lentils way more than the average person, but is that worth $15-18 when the meal was $2 of lentils and maybe $1 of salad and likewise $12 for the appetizer? No. 

Highs: Tasty food and nice presentation
Lows: Unoriginal tea selection, overpriced, no highchair
Verdict: good to go to without kids for a nice romantic veggie meal?"

We had a carrot soup with a touch of ginger and cardamom, vegetable pannini with pesto, berry crepes with preserves and fresh fruit, side salad with delicate citrus dressing and buckwheat stuffed zucchini.

Tucked out of the way in the Village Square shopping center in the horseshoe area.  A nice little gem that&#39;s different from the normal.  Vegetarian, freshly prepared.  Loved the décor - the husband of the team has made the bar countertop and some of the tabletops and mosaics on the wall - what a talent!!  The wife handles the food part.  And of course, that&#39;s what we&#39;re there for - 
Hubs ordered the polenta with mushrooms.  Started with a bowl of the carrot/ginger soup - very delicious, with almonds on top that added a nice crush and flavor.  It came with a salad wrapped in a cucumber bowl.  Very creamy polenta with very tasty, thickly sliced mushrooms.

I ordered the lentil plate (K) - it also came with a bowl of the soup.  The lentil plate was cold, which wasn&#39;t expected, but delicious.  Grapes, peppers, kale, and asparagus along with naan accompanied the dish.  Enough that I couldn&#39;t finish, but hubs helped me out!  

Would have loved to come a few weeks ago to enjoy eating outside, but this was nice as well.  Just nice music, and lovely décor - perfect date night, and eating so healthy.  

Condolences to the family on the loss of their Grandfather tonight - you&#39;re in our thoughts and prayers.

But We saw the prices and quickly decided we would only order the cheapest item, an appetizer to share, and a couple coffees. The $14+ appetizer took, 45 min to get to our table and it was only 6 stalks of asparagus, garnished. The waitress attentively acknowledged our long wait without us even saying anything and offered us a few small pieces of a pita type bread  to tide us over .. 2 x..  To sum it up.. The wait and the pricing was awful and it&#39;s not a fancy place that warranted such pricing.. We will never go back. The whole experience left us starving as we were just trying to be nice and just get a quick bite. Go somewhere else more affordable for dinner."

I never expected it to taste so good. When it comes to the main course I don&#39;t know where to begin. I had the portobello mushroom. It had so many levels of taste from the smell, to the first moment it hits your tounge, to the moment it enters your stomach. I found my self cutting it into smaller and smaller pieces because I didn&#39;t want the meal to end.  My stomach felt very relaxed and not full because of the ginger.

Renata the co owner was super awesome and said they are always more then happy to Veganise pretty much anything on the menu and it was so amazingly good, fresh, and ontop of that healthy. Not to mention that the atmosphere is lovely. It&#39;s really warm, cozy, and beautifully decorated by Rentata, who co owns it with her husband that&#39;s the cook. He cooks everything from scratch and they really work hard at finding the best of the best produce to use for thier food and it truly shows because the food is flavorful without them having to use lots of salt, or oils or anything like that. It&#39;s really pure healthy simple food packed with great flavor and it&#39;s very satisfying too. They have a really nice bar there too which is great as well. I&#39;ll be comming back frequently for sure! So incredibly thankful that there&#39;s a place like this let alone out by me in the northern burbs. I don&#39;t have to drive into the city anymore if I don&#39;t want to, to enjoy an awesome vegan meal at a vegitarian/vegan restaurant.

This was not one of those night. 

Back story is this place is in a Chicago suburb and the Cubs are playing in the playoffs. They have recliner seats in front of big screens that you can eat off of dinner trays. We just sat at a booth

We waited 30 minutes for our table which wasn&#39;t terrible. We had drinks at the bar so once we got seated we didn&#39;t need anything except for a little time looking at the menu. Our waiter came back to our table 25 minutes after we sat down. Once we order a couple of my coworkers ordered a refill which didn&#39;t come out until our meals did. About 25 minutes later for a couple orders of meatloaf and a burger. One of the guys reminded our server he needed a refill of Diet Coke at that time and that is when we got our refills. 

The next time we saw our server was at least another 30 minutes when he just brought us our check. 

The Meatloaf was below par and not in the golf way and the service was not great. That is why this trip got two stars."

The look of the tavern is very nice, with a laid back type of feel. Nice ambiance and the choice of eating indoors or outdoors.

I had the Westwood Chicken Sandwich which itself was delicious. The balance between the various parts of the sandwich was great. My sandwich came with fries which seemed a bit over fried. The seasoning on them masked this a bit. They were edible but not the most enjoyable.

In general our waitress was very nice and attentive to our needs. Unfortunately the service was pretty slow, with food taking close to 40 minutes to come out. For a lunch break that was just too long. I&#39;d probably come back again but only if I knew I had time to kill."

We were going to go somewhere else but the wait was over an hour so we decided to come here. They had a wait too, about 30-45 minutes, but compared to an hour and given the fact that we were starving we figured it was still worth the wait.

My guess was there was a wait at both of these restaurants because they were the only off-chain restaurant within miles and after travelling so far we really wanted to avoid places we can dine at anytime. 

We got our table notification text a little before the 30 minute mark and were escorted upstairs. That when we noticed a bar on the second floor that may have been open seating, next time we know! We wanted to sit at the bar since they offer the full menu service but there was no place to sit.

The table, or should I say, couches we were seated at was a nice touch, plus they were super comfortable! At first there was another couple at our table, guess they had the same idea as us to try sitting at the bar and figured that table was part of the bar. But it wasn&#39;t, also good to know. It was a great spot, overlooking the first floor and bar with a giant TV screen.

The food was great. I was hesitant to order the salmon because I always order the salmon and it&#39;s just to be healthy. Never do it because it is the best tasting dish on the menu. As soon as I told the waitress I was even considering the salmon she lit up and told me it was one of their top 3 dishes! So I ordered that and my husband ordered their house burger, which also looked pretty good. We also ordered some chips and guac to start.

I must emphasize how spot on my waitress was about the salmon!! One of the best, if not the best, I ever had! I think I only enjoyed one salmon fillet more and that was only because it was at an uber expensive restaurant. This was sweet yet tangy and the price was totally affordable. Under $20. The guac and homemade tortilla chips were also delish. My husband was very happy with his burger. 

The food came out fast and fresh so we made it to our evening concert with time to spare. Great way to spend our last night of our Chicago trip!"

I ordered the flatbread and was disappointed to discover it was dry, overcooked, and lacking flavor, which is what I always fear when ordering flatbreads. 

The environment is nice with tv&#39;s, an outdoor patio, a spacious bar, and plenty of seating. Service was good during the afternoon for lunch. I&#39;d probably go back again for drinks and appetizers, but not too interested in eating another meal there."

The atmosphere and setup of the restaurant is very cool and welcoming. There is a bar area inside along with a dining area with several tvs. Then there is a very nice outside section also with a bar and tvs above the bar.

There were 4 of us. We ordered the chips and guacamole as an appetizer. Entrees ordered at the table were: a burger with the patty, bacon, and an egg with the side of fries. The French dip rib sandwich with the meat juice and horseradish (on the side) for dipping served with a side of fries. The special artic char meal. I ordered the cranberry chicken salad and the crunchy pig and lobster roll. 

The salad is large, definitely dinner sized portion. Chicken, dried cranberries, pecans, and Bleu cheese. The crunchy pig and lobster roll (6 pcs): avocado, a little white rice, lobster, Jalapeño and bacon. Both very good! 

We also ordered drinks. I had a couple martinis including the mangoberry and Hollywood nights. Both good, but Hollywood Nights is a must order. It&#39;s green with a cherry at the bottom. It says it&#39;s sour but if anything it&#39;s a bit sweet and tastes mostly like pineapple juice. It&#39;s amazing.

This place is a good place to enjoy dinner with friends or family, as well as grab a few drinks with a group."

Went with a friend of mine tonight and food order took longer than  two other tables that came after us.    Then when friend complained about his order after they finally gave the wings,  she said it was because I ordered the appetizer which was besides the point because that appetizer took forever.    

She tried to clean up act after I stared as she gave a third table their order.    She afterwards bought the soy sauce then later said the sushi makers must&#39;ve left early for the night.    Whatever. 

The Signature roll I ordered eventually arrived and I have to say it was far from it.    Granted its a bar and sushi probably isn&#39;t their specialty but since they advertised quite a few choices,  they should at least make it decent. 

As much as I don&#39;t want to play the so-called &#34;race card&#34;, my friend and I were the only black folks in the restaurant.    Even if I wasn&#39;t relocating soon,  I won&#39;t be back ever."

They do have a good selection of beer and cocktails (it&#39;s a bar). While entering, the place looks really spacious and open. We were seated upstairs and it was actually really neat because they have recliners (I believe) in front of big screen TVs where you may enjoy the game while being served food and drinks.

So, we started with the seared tuna with some asian slaw for an appetizer which was quite delicious. The waitress was attentive at this point, coming back with drink orders, taking the order quickly so no complaint so far. Then, she disappeared for a little bit. When our entree came, we had to move dishes around because the table hasn&#39;t been cleared for a while even though we&#39;ve finished the appetizers way before the entrees came.

Someone else brought the food order to the table. I tried my mango salad and it was actually good and then the spicy tuna rolls. The rolls were not at all spicy to my standard and they were fairly average-tasting. Sure, this isn&#39;t really a sushi bar but they do have a sizable sushi menu and I did notice several people ordering them. Dining partner thought the fish and chips were &#34;nothing to write home about&#34; and mentioned that Applebee&#39;s had better fish and chips.

Overall, I think if you are looking for a place to have drinks and maybe some appetizers, then this would be it. Otherwise, I really wasn&#39;t too impressed and perhaps the wait staff could dial down on the attitude a little. I noticed how almost everyone of their wait staff (the ones I&#39;ve seen upstairs anyway) were walking around like they were angry at the world. Smile, life isn&#39;t that bad."

At Westwood Tavern in Schaumburg, you get all of that but the food is much better than what you would expect from a sports bar. 

The great thing about Westwood Tavern is the variety in food options. They have taken bar food staples and kicked it up a notch. You can get your nachos, burgers, tacos, and flatbreads to accompany your beer but you can also get sushi rolls and sashimi if bar food isn&#39;t your thing. The foot long grilled cheese caught my eye - it&#39;s a twist on grilled cheese and tomato soup by adding braised short rib beef with smoked gouda grilled mushrooms. I decided on giving my cholesterol a break and chose the grilled salmon and green beans instead which was delicious and the healthier choice. 

The venue is great for groups whether you are with a rowdy crowd to watch the game or to enjoy a nice dinner with the family. There is enough space where you can be surrounded by screens to watch several games at a time or prefer a quieter setting away from the sports fanatics. Service was excellent and the prices are reasonable with food portions larger than expected."

This restaurant has a nice, clean modern looking interior with custom beer taps on the table, fireplaces, outdoor bar, and tons of TV&#39;s. The reason I&#39;m giving this restaurant 3 stars however is that the prices are a bit high, even for the suburbs --- and the food is really not special enough to justify these prices. Even the appetizers are priced high enough where a small bite and one of the drink specials will set you back around $20 easily. The entrees are not a lot better, where the portion size suggests that you&#39;re eating at a fine dining establishment (but this is really fancier looking bar food). 

Overall, stick to the drink specials and grab food elsewhere if you&#39;re hungry."

Went there with the family on a friday night and that was the vibe. I don&#39;t know how it is on other nights though.
The server could have been a little nicer, she didn&#39;t introduce herself and didn&#39;t even crack a smile the time we were there.  Our food came out as what we ordered, didn&#39;t wait for a table and will probably try it another day."

The set up of this bar/restaurant is pretty great, probably my favorite part. They have a downstairs and an upstairs with bars on each level. TVs are everywhere and they have large booths and tables so this place is great for groups. Some of the booths even have taps right at the table which is pretty sweet, not to mention leather lounge chairs placed right in front of TVs! Plus, outdoor seating! How great is that? Seems to be a pretty popular after work spot.

Their menu is interesting because they have quite the variety; typical bar food such as burgers and wraps, but then they also have things like tacos and fish and a pretty extensive sushi list. Both times I&#39;ve been here now I&#39;ve gotten the fish and chips. I&#39;m honestly not sure why, they have way more exciting menu options! Must have just been craving fish frye on those days... who knows.

At Westwood you&#39;ll find a huge beer list as well as signature cocktails and of course a full bar. They have a daily drink special list as well.

Now to break down the good stuff...

Tavern Fish &amp; Chips - three pieces of fresh cod in a beer batter paired with malted vinegar &amp; seasoned hand cut fries ($15). This is very good! Fish had the perfect texture and the seasoned fries are bomb dot com.

Pulled Chicken Nachos - cheddar &amp; jack cheese, sour cream, jalapeños, tomatoes, lettuce, green onion, guacamole, and roasted salsa ($9.50). Great for sharing with a group! Nothing mind blowing, but definitely pretty damn delicious.

Cucumber Strawberry Press (signature cocktail) - Effen cucumber vodka, strawberry puree, and sprite ($8). Refreshing and delicious! I&#39;m a sucker for anything cucumber lately and this cocktail combo hit the spot just right.

Service - friendly but honestly pretty slow. Both times I&#39;m been here (on a Thursday and Friday night) they&#39;ve been really busy, but still, good service is still expected. This is really the only reason I couldn&#39;t give the last star!

I will definitely be back to Westwood. I&#39;m really intrigued to give their sushi menu a whirl!"

Employees: our waitress was awesome. She was always on the ball of everything and never was too annoying when checking in. The people greeting had some attitude and I felt like they didn&#39;t really do the place justice but decided to let it go (girl with big glasses). Our waitress was awesome, let me add again (blonde). 

Atmosphere: very welcoming and had a home appearance. So much fun and warm (definitely hate being cold in a restaurant) I really enjoyed the surroundings. 

Food: everything, AND I MEAN everything I had was amazing. The cornbread was perfectly cooked (filling and more dessert bound for me) but had a sweet feel to it. The maple butter was the topping that was out of control experience. Loved it with the cornbread. The trio sampler is so worth the try, you will not be disappointed by the appearance and  juiciness of the food. It&#39;s worth it especially if you want to try a few things. I got the southwest salad; for me it had too much seasoning but it was good. I would go for anything but a salad after all the stuff I tried for the night, you really will not be disappointed here."

Westwood Tavern was nearby, and the casual atmosphere didn&#39;t frown upon our yoga pants and messy buns.  It isn&#39;t a divey restaurant though; I like spots that can be super casual or slightly upscale.  The dark wood tables and cozy booths scream &#34;upscale Schaumburg,&#34; while the beer taps at the tables and TVs bring you back down to earth.

I didn&#39;t partake in the table tap, but how cool and convenient is that?  Purchase a beer and refill it at your convenience, no waiting!  You do pay by the ounce though, so be careful!

I love the diverse menu at Westwood Tavern.  Burgers, salads, and even sushi!  I had the best turkey burger here, topped with apricot and cranberry, and STUFFED with brie!  The fries are sprinkled with parmesan.  I dipped them in the housemade ranch.  These are no ordinary fries.

The beer menu (if you&#39;ve decided to skip the table tap) offers many local brews on tap and in cans or bottles. I went with a Goose Island Green Line.

Westwood Tavern is a comfortable atmosphere that isn&#39;t too sporty or too snooty.  My friend and I loved our food and could&#39;ve taken a nap in the booth after an hour of sweaty yoga.  It&#39;s near Woodfield Mall and much more worthwhile than the chains within the mall."

This place is not far from my hotel and my office.  The bar is quite large.  Has a pretty decent sized horseshoe shaped bar with a bunch of big screen TV&#39;s over the bar.  All around the bar are tables and booths.  Scattered all around are move TV&#39;s.  They have an upstairs space that is quite big, lots of tables for dining in.  They also have a decent sized outdoor space with a bar and TVs.  Decent amount of bar stools around the bar and about two dozen tables.  Overall, it is a nice vibe...seems a little upscale, but it is quite casual.

Each night they have some sort of happy hour special...some sort of beer or martini special.  They menu is quite vast.  For good, they have some decent sushi. I enjoyed the jalapeño rolls, signature rolls, crunchy pig and lobster roll, ahi tuna sashimi and freshwater eel.  In addition, they have lots of standard bar fare.  They have burgers, wings, salads, flatbreads, tacos and some signature entrees. 

They have about 15 beers on tap.  Those taps consist of macro and micro brews.  They also have 50-60 beers in bottles.  They have your standard Miller Lite, Corona, Coors light...as well as some nice breweries like Victory, Allagash, Lagunitas, Great Lakes, Oscar Blues, Two Brothers, Deschutes...etc.  Plenty of beer styles, IPAs, Hefeweizen, American Wheat, Stouts, Porters, Pale Ales, Rye beers...A more than ample selection. 

The staff here is just fine.  They always have plenty of help.  Our waitress (different each night) was always around, but not nagging.  They were quick to answer questions and you never waited around for another drink (not that I had that many).  

Overall, this is a great place in Schaumburg.  If you are looking for a nice casual place, stop in.  There are always a ton of people here, but with all the space, you are not bumping into people.  It is a more professional crowd (if you want to consider me professional)."

It&#39;s was awesome 10/10. The interior is classy yet casual, the booths were large and comfortable but had little space for your feet (large box under table that I assumed had the table kegs in it)

I ordered the sushi Osaka style which was the best sushi I have ever had. I then got the prime rib dip which was good (not great) the Aus jus sauce was really salty but it was fine other than that. My girlfriend had the southwest chicken salad which was great and very comparable to cooper&#39;s hawks southwest chicken salad. Also had a couple martinis for 5$ martini wednesday. Can&#39;t beat it!"

I&#39;m glad it was because I really like this place. Their fish and chips is so fresh and crispy. And the nachos are good (beware of the hot peppers!) Seriously some of the best fish I&#39;ve had. It is a nice bar with several televisions. I was able to watch my Cubbies win while other White Sox fans watched their game and ate with disappointment.Perfect lol

We sat in round booth: and because they somehow thought it cool to put x2 beer taps in the table you sit at... this literally negates ANY leg room you would otherwise have... i.e. you have Zero Leg room because there is a large box/posts etc UNLESS you sit sideways.
Food: Appetizer: We got the &#34;Crunchy Pig&#34; Lobster rolls= Not terrible, not great
Entree: She got Fish Tacos: Said they were flavorless as well as the salsa was weak:
I got the 1foot long brisket grilled cheese. 
It was OK but nothing special for sure.
(Think Long piece of white bread w white &amp; american cheese with flavorless roast beef on it, along with a small cup of (likely canned) tomato soup for dipping. Fries: While I&#39;m admittedly picky with fries, these were obviously re-dips/had been sitting for a while... as far as catsup none was ever offered.
After comparing it to an Applebee&#39;s Cousin restaurant We both agreed we won&#39;t be back!"

She told me that the Westwood Tavern is the place to be for food, drinks, and fun.

And as such, I tended to believe her. We met up here at 11am and the restaurant / bar had a few people already sitting in there. It&#39;s Friday after all and people want to start the weekend already. Don&#39;t blame them one bit! The parking here can get crazy, as it shares spaces with a mall adjacent to it. Thankful that I quickly found parking nearby the restaurant, so time wasn&#39;t wasted. Westwood Tavern can be characterized as being like dining in Buffalo Wild Wings or maybe Chili&#39;s type of setting. I had already eaten breakfast an hour earlier, so all I did was order lunch, but in a take out box. While I wished I had some alcohol with my friend, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t - since I had to drive 3 hours to Green Bay from Schaumburg that day. Still it was a nice venue to hang out with my friend, whom I haven&#39;t seen since 2010. My friend had some alcohol though, pretty sure she can handle one while driving. Lol

Westwood Tavern is located at 1385 N Meacham Avenue in Schaumburg, IL. They accept credit cards, as usual and they serve definitely comfort food and burgers for the masses. For the most part, the ambiance here was decently louder than I had thought, but not so quiet to where it was a problem. The lights were kind of dim, but not so much to where it was mood lighting. After all, it was 11am! Kind of weird to have that, unless they were saving $$ on electricity. Prices here were normal, where it can range from $6 to $10 for burger combos and $10+ for other delicious entrees. The service here at the Westwood Tavern was pretty good and nice. It was quick bite for lunch and we had the waitress take a photo of us after the meal. It was good. I didn&#39;t think the restaurant was air conditioned when we were there, but I could be mistaken. Oh well.

For me, I got the Chicago burger, which ended up being eaten at a rest stop on the Illinois / Wisconsin state line. It came with French fries and it was satisfying. The burger itself was pretty good, juicy, and delicious. Had to find a place for liquids to wash it down, but all was good. My friend also had a burger and fries, which seemed good and delicious as well - at least she ate most of it before getting full up. Still, I wasn&#39;t too impressed with what Westwood Tavern had to offer. Although good service and good food was adamantly was there, I felt like there was something lacking. Maybe it was the air conditioning. Not sure though. 

Since my Schaumburg friend loves to go here with her friends, maybe it&#39;s a good ideal place to hang out after work or on the weekends.

Support local!

The summer is even better when they have the beautiful patio open. I definitely recommend the brunch menu on sundays that goes til 2:30.

I loved the layout of the restaurant and the ambiance was very warm and cozy. The waitstaff was great and very accommodating to our large party - there were about 15 of us. Definitely a cool place to visit with friends or just on date night. I ordered their Sweet Chili Salmon with a side of Lodge Cornbread and both were pretty freaking amazing! The salmon was seasoned and cooked perfectly, and cornbread came with a delicious maple butter that you couldn&#39;t help but lick off of the knife! The beer menu was fairly large, too.

I was able to take pictures of the room we booked and a month before the shower, Amanda met with me for final touches of of center pieces. Decorating prior to the event was 
Nice and the staff took care of all our guests. It was really so nice to have them keep the event moving so we didn&#39;t have to do much. The staff were professionals and courteous. The food was excellent we had the chicken and fish my guests said it was the best food they ever had and it was just a luncheon. They helped with taking all the things we brought to the event. Unloaded and reloaded with no extra effort. They were on my heels every step. Never once had to look for the staff.

I like the place. The decor is fine. Nothing amazing but I am not expecting Italian architectural design either. I absolutely love the chairs upstairs. Who doesnt tho? Their patio is phenomenal in the summer, minus the mosquitoes. They have specials everyday and a fun list of beers on tap and bottles. Great food choices are the natchos, the guac, pot roast, grilled cheese, I also like their salads as well. What I dont like is their sushi. But then again if I visit an american sports bar I am not bound to have some kick ass rolls. I am bound to overpay but not necessaily love them. 
Except for the fact that the older suburban crowd has pretty much infested the joint I think it may be one of the best places in Schaumburg."

No other signs of vegetables at all (minus the fried onion straws on top of my pot roast). I would highly recommend getting the corn bread here though.

The only thing I would like to suggest to them is this: please put wasabi into a separate ramican container when doing carry-out.  I got salmon nigiri today, which was great, the fish quality was on point.  The only thing that ruined it was that, due to being carry out, the nigiri rolled around all in the wasabi, so by the time I got it back to the office, it was covered in wasabi :(

Love the food, love the staff and the atmosphere, just don&#39;t love wasabi all over my sushi.  I usually only use a pinch, which is why i didn&#39;t ask for no wasabi.  Better luck next time I hope."

And thinking that would have been on the &#34;small side&#34; I also ordered the seared ahi tuna appetizer...which I could have ordered as a meal with how much asian slaw there was it was like a salad. 

I will DEFINITELY be back upon next visit."

Much to our surprise, at 7:30 p.m., there was no waiting! Very spacious inside with banks of TVs to watch sports. Although there were 2 parties of 20 to 30 people in the upper area where we were placed, we had service perfect for our occasion - not rushed but not too slow. We had nachos and cornbread for appetizers - both full of flavor. Us girls split a caesar salad and fish fry - perfect for us after the warm up. The guys got bacon wrapped meatloaf and the foot long  beef brisket grilled cheese. Amazing food. Drinks were just great with a full beer and wine menu - including gluten free beer. We had cocktails that were mixed well. Dessert was the perfect finishing touch. Jimmy, our server, was very warm and attentive. Overall the meal was affordable and we had leftovers to look forward to. (well, not the meatloaf, it was devoured as it was served over mashed potatoes with onion straws on top.) This is our new great place to go! It was loud, but it was a Friday night. We just wish they opened up earlier on the weekend to watch Premier Soccer League. Next time we get the sushi - the platters we saw for other tables were huge!"

While working in the suburbs, Westwood was our post-work spot for drinks and appetizers, especially during patio season. Loaded with a full bar and fireplace, their outdoor seating is convenient and well-staffed. The only thing that would improve it would be a view of something other than the parking lot. But hey, it is the suburbs. 

Mid-average pricing here, but ask for drink specials. I love their tacos and nachos. The serving sizes are quite large so be prepared to share. 

What I love most about this joint is the atmosphere. Even inside, you feel as if you&#39;re not in the suburbs. It&#39;s got that semi-dark atmosphere that makes it mysterious enough for evening outings, yet appropriate for an escape during the work day. Prefer for a professional lunch, too!"

I&#39;ve also been there on a Friday night and the cocktails sucked. Order three different drinks and they all were terrible. The fish and chips had absolutely no seasoning on it at all. Terrible. The atmosphere isn&#39;t that great. People aren&#39;t that personable. All in all I&#39;ll stick to just Wednesday nights.

Ample parking and easy to get to.  The food was delicious as were the drinks.  We (hubs and I) generally sit at the bar bc you usually get much better service.  That was not the case at Westwood-wasn&#39;t even greeted with a hello.  The bartenders (two of them) were distracted and kinda bitchy.  They spent most of the time talking to each other about their  love lives and ignoring the customers.   I was super annoyed as a patron when I ask for a glass of water to accompany my dinner and get an eye roll.  Maybe the eye roll wasn&#39;t intended for me but either way very unprofessional.  
I will def return and may actually say something to management should this happen again.  To the bartenders:  keep your heads up girls...there&#39;s more to life than lost love, and try not to lack basic friendly exchanges."

I ordered the foot long grilled cheese. The sauteed mushrooms and tender braised short rib meat really made a classic American comfort food taste a little more sophisticated and unique. The fries came out lightly seasoned and crispy; very enjoyable. And no visit to Westwood is complete without a little banana cream pie. The homemade graham cracker crumbs are moist and chewy, they almost remind me of a soft brown sugar cookie. Throw in the homemade custard, whipped cream, caramel, and plenty of bananas...for six bucks? It&#39;s tough to find a better dessert value than that! 

Service was solid, they brought me some jalapeno aioli for the fries. Although I would have liked a to go container for it when I asked for the fries to go. I know I could have asked for it, but I didn&#39;t want to be too difficult. All in all, I had a very good experience."

It&#39;s very spacious, and even when it looks like it&#39;s mobbed, it&#39;s really not. (Keep in mind I&#39;m a big guy, seating is most important for my comfort). You will get seated right away, you might have to walk a bit from the parking lot, but it is worth it. I am not one for waiting, EVER. The seating is too notch. I come here if I want a classy atmosphere, good bar, and great food. Upstairs they even have a lounge area with recliners and flat screens in front of the leather recliners. You can eat in the recliners to if you wish to. The food is spectacular. All your typical American food with some extras like bacon wrapped meatloaf which is terrific. They have very good quality sushi too! Try the Spicy Tuna Osaka Style. It&#39;s very good. I will admit, sometimes you can get a server that is slow or having a bad night, but that can happen everywhere. Sometimes a server can be rude too. When it does happen I have said something to management and they take care of me better than anywhere I&#39;ve experience a complaint at. This place to me, one ups any bar/restaurant in the area for quality, style, comfort, and affordability. Their prices are extremely fair for this type of ambiance and quality.

I ordered a roll of their sushi and their salad.  The sushi roll was pretty bad.  I didn&#39;t really wanted to finish it.  I wish I remembered what kind of sushi it was, but the fish wasn&#39;t very good and neither was the rice.  Their salad was amazing though.  It was large enough to be a meal (which I was scared I would still be hungry).  The salad had cranberries, pecans, and a cranberry vinaigrette. YUMMY!  My dad had their corn bread appetizer and their meatloaf.  The corn bread tasted too sweet and had a weird texture.  I didn&#39;t care for it.  The meatloaf was pretty salty since it was wrapped in bacon and had friend onions garnished on top.

Overall I really enjoyed the salad, but everything else wasn&#39;t that great.  I would definitely come back for the salad!"

Not much about the menu really interests me, but the skirt steak arrachera (?)  is really good.  Not offered on the weekends/Sunday though. 

Otherwise, my go-to choice is the southwestern salad, and they&#39;ve let me pick a different dressing for it.

The times that I have been here, there have always been some kind of game on, the last time being this weekend, it was Preakness/the end of a pathetic game 2 of the Western Conf. Stanley Cup semi-finals.  But I digress...

I&#39;ve always been able to find something to eat here. but I tend to linger towards the fish tacos(for what it is, it&#39;s actually pretty filling) the fish and chips(standard pub fare)and the sushi.  I know, sushi at this place?  How can it be that good?  It&#39;s actually not bad.  Fresh ingredients, pretty standard rolls, I&#39;m telling you, a tight wrap with good rice goes a long way.  

The menu is two-sided, with one side dedicated to the items with ABV% and the other half to food.  But there&#39;s something for every taste as far as food goes flatbreads, apps, burgers, there&#39;s even a fish option if you&#39;re so inclined.  My latest discovery at Westwood was the Tavern Chopped Salad.  Yum-O.  I wish it was chopped romaine, but I&#39;m fine with iceberg.  Topped with sliced avocado, hard boiled egg, chicken, BACON and bleu cheese and tossed with ranch dressing, I thought it was plenty big for one to tackle, and probably the right size for splitting.  I had to really dig deep to down this dish(omg, I didn&#39;t mean to alliterate that LOL) since I wasn&#39;t going to be able to store my leftovers soon enough and with the summer-like temps we had this weekend, I wasn&#39;t chancing it.  I killed it.  

My wife had the sweet chili salmon with the sautéed green beans, holy schnikes, the green beans were so good, I wish they were offered as their own side dish.  Sautéed with garlic and tomatoes and who knows what else, I ate the rest of her plate after I finished my salad.  

Like I said, I&#39;ve always liked the food here, and we&#39;ve always had good service, whether dining with just my wife or with a 20 person dinner party, service is always tip-top.

Haven&#39;t had a chance to eat on the patio, for some reason it&#39;s always freezing cold or burning hot when we come here.  

For a solid meal and a beer while you catch the game, Westwood delivers the goods!"

From the food to the atmosphere, this place is my favorite restaurant to go to.  My cousin brought me here my first weekend moving to the Chicago suburbs.  Now, I take all of my friends and family here when they visit! It&#39;s a great place to come and watch football, basketball and hockey or enjoy a lunch or dinner with some friends. 

They have booths for groups that have taps at your convenience!  This is great for bringing a group here to watch the big game.  The servers are always very friendly and are more than happy to get the tap started for you.  I&#39;ve never had a bad server at Westwood!  Calling ahead is no problem - and they are very accommodating. I&#39;ve tried almost everything at Westwood in my time of going here, however below is my Top Food List picks:

Sushi: Green Dragon
Salad: Southwestern Buffalo Ranch
Sandwich: Grilled Cheese
Desert: Red Velvet Cheesecake"

Every year, I plan the company party and this year I knew I wanted to hire a casino company to come in. I then had to find a venue that had a nice bar package (we&#39;re a company full of social drinkers), good food and would allow us bring the casino company in. Enter the hidden gem to hold parties: Westwood. I had no idea they had a basement that was huge where people hold company parties, weddings and other events. Not only that but it&#39;s an AWESOME space. 

Westwood was so great in the planning process helping me with the food &amp; drink options and ensuring all was secured for the night of the party. They let me come in 2 hours before the event started to get everything ready. Much to my surprise the place looked beyond fantastic! It was the holidays and they had a couple of beautifully decorated Christmas trees, red tablecloths and very nice place settings along with centerpieces. I had bought poinsettias for all the tables but really they were not at all necessary as they had such nice centerpieces. Our initial bartender I introduced myself to was meh and I was pretty happy when i saw him roll out and another, much more friendly guy come in. They were really good about taking care of us the whole night though they did put a tip jar out. I let all our employees know that we were covering the bartenders tips for the whole night when we signed at the end, so no need for the double dipping.

They had hookups for music and you can play either CDs or bring in an MP3 player to hookup. The sound was great plus their was a mic so I could do my thing. My thing being making annoucements &amp; such not singing. :D

We did a buffet for all of our employees for the night and everyone was really happy with the food selection &amp; how tasty it all was. 

We also had our own personal coat room &amp; bathrooms for the evening.

To boot, the pricing was incredibly reasonable. I believe that we had to meet a minimum of $1000 of food &amp; drinks, then the room rental was at no cost. We were way above that so it was perfect.

I know Westwood is good for meeting friends for drinks. I know it can be great for a casual bite to eat, too. But now I know what a great location it can be to hold events, as well. I highly recommend the Chicago Room in the basement to others and wouldn&#39;t hesitate holding another function there myself."

He has been here before and suggested to get the foot long grilled cheese but said its not directly on the menu but they can make it. So when our server Alex (Alexandria) came to take our order my friend said &#34;Can i get the foot long grilled cheese, with just the 3 cheeses on it and bacon&#34; okay and soup and fires okay with that. He said hes and i asked for the same thing. When our food came we looked at our sandwichs and there was mushrooms and some type of brisket. When we asked our server what did she give us. She said &#34;thats what you ordered&#34;. We said &#34;no we said a grilled cheese with the 3 cheeses and just bacon&#34;. Then she informed us that they don&#39;t make that. We were confused because for 1. He got it before. And for 2. We specifically said &#34;just the 3 cheeses and bacon&#34;. She failed to understand what we wanted and failed to wite it down properly for the cooks to make it as we ordered. So it was her fault. 

Not to mention she messed up our drink orders giving me a diet coke when i asked for a coke and giving my friend a coke when he asked for a sprite. And then we had empty drinks for over 10 minutes. Which ruined our meal even more than the messed up sandwiches. She barley came to our table and was never around. And after we were noticeably done with our meals, ya know with our napkins on our plates and plates stacked up. We had to wait an additional 10 minutes for her to notice and bring us our bill. 

Needless to say i was very disappointed"

The food was okay, again, not memorable.
I ordered the Fish Tacos.  They come as &#34;build yourself&#34;.  The Fish was seasoned well, but overcooked which made it dry and not flake-able. The toppings that came with were gauac, tomatoes, onion and cilantro.  There was also a large helping of black beans and rice.  
My friend ordered a special with was Buffalo Chicken with Tots.  The chicken and sauce came all mixed in with the tots - like a casserole.  He thought it was good, but the tots were soggy from too much sauce.
All in all, okay, would go back in an evening setting for drinks and to try another selection of food."

Clean bathrooms. Outdoor patio. Free wifi.  Password is westwood1. Menu is a bit scattered. Try the pot roast sliders!

Where to start? Everything was amazing! I got a cup of their cheddar ale soup with bacon, my goodness I was actually sad when I took the last bite {I&#39;m such a foodie}. The flavor was excellent and the bacon was the perfect complement. I also got the Jack cheese covered pretzel- yuuuuuum. It was huge, and smothered in cheese. I got the apricot habanero dipping sauce. It wasn&#39;t my favorite (disclaimer I&#39;m not normally a sweet/spicy combination), but if you like apricot and spice I&#39;m sure it was perfect. My hubby ordered the salted and cinnamon pretzels, he devoured them both. 

Overall, we will absolutely be back. The location itself is very small, don&#39;t plan on eating there (although there is a cute little bar top area with about 4 seats). But it&#39;s clean, organized, and super cute. I did read on the sign that they close early if they sell out, so plan to get there early. We went around 2pm and the pickings were running out. I can see why! To top off this perfect rating, everything we ordered was only $12. Such a reasonable price for all of the food we received."

Firstly, you want to get here as early in the day as possible, for two reasons:  one, they will sell out of the special of the day if you get there after 2pm, and two, the pretzles get dried out the longer they sit under those heat lamps, so by 2 or 3pm, they are hardly worth eating. Dunking them in the soup doesn&#39;t help even.  Honestly, I don&#39;t think I ever had a fresh pretzel that wasn&#39;t sitting around all day there.
Ok, next, the soups are very good. I would go there for those alone, but its a better value to purchase pretzel and soup combo.  Just now I won&#39;t go there unless its early in the day so the pretzel isn&#39;t dried out, I hope.  Think Aunt Annies pretzels, they are hardly worth eating after they have sat around too. 
So there you have it, a typical suburban cafe that&#39;s sort of good."

I just wish their selection was a teeny bit larger, but I get it. They are a super small joint that specialize in a few amazing things. 

Came here one afternoon with the family (my hubs and toddler) for a quick lunch. I&#39;d been wanting to try this place for a while so we decided to trek on over. They had garlic and cheese pretzel for the Daily Special. I wasn&#39;t too excited about it but my husband and I each got one plus a cup of soup. We split the pretzels and soup between us and our daughter. The soup was extremely hot. Like, this was going to give me 3rd degree burns if I even got a little splash on me. Give the soup a few minutes to cool down because it is worth it! It wasn&#39;t excessively salty like most restaurant soups. It tasted homemade - delicious!

On to our pretzels. They were scrumptious and every bite was a perfect ratio of pretzel to cheese. It came with a marinara dipping sauce that was unique and fit the pretzel perfectly.

It was a crisp &amp; sunny afternoon so we grabbed a spot on one of their picnic tables in the back. I think there are maybe 3-4 tables so not a lot of seating - and only outdoors FYI.

Overall this is a great little spot! I am going to be back in here whenever I&#39;m in the vicinity."

Good size large enough to share. Today I am waiting for the gyro stuffed and cheesecake stuffed.  They both sound delish.  Limit s quantities so need to get there early. And there is always a line.

Hahaha--Who were we kidding.  The aroma of fresh baked pretzels made us dig into the paper bag as we were driving away. And my four year old son proclaimed &#34;These are the best pretzels ever!&#34;  

The space is small--like a pop up store small. But on nice days you can have a seat outside on some of their deck chairs and enjoy them.  

The day we visited there was a small line--about 5 people but it moved quickly.  I got the stuffed pretzel fo the day--Monterrey Jack Cheese and a plain salted.  The dough has that nice pretty brown crust and very soft chew.  The stuffed pretzel was stuffed with really good mild cheese and an automatic fave.  They offer dipping sauces but since we were on the go we will have to try the sauces next time. The Apricot Habanero sauce and Creamy Mustard sounded really good. 

They also offer soft drinks in their cooler (and my favorite Pelligrino!), pretzel chips, soups, and you can pre-order mini pretzels and giant pretzels too.  So cool that so much goodness comes out of a small shop.  Super friendly service.  Reasonable prices."

We drove up from Naperville on a weekday near opening time to see what all the fuss was about. The location is great, the place is super clean and well organized, and they offer just enough on the menu. 

We had the salami and provolone stuffed pretzel, as well as the garlic/parm and Monterrey Jack pretzels. I ordered two dipping sauces (creamy mustard and apricot habanero), both of which were pretty meh, but didn&#39;t set me back much. To round out our meal, and potentially entice the little one to eat a bit, we ordered cups of the broccoli cheddar soup and tomato bisque.

The pretzels were really delicious. The stuffed one was awesome. The other two lacked a little flavor, but were tender and moist- obviously freshly made. Soups were too thick and not blended down quite enough, but I appreciated having it to round out the meal. We sat outside on the deck on a gorgeous day, and that made it all the nicer. Looking forward to coming back for one of those Nutella stuffed ones. Uh, yes please!"

I quickly changed my mind as I&#39;ve been wanting to check this place out.  I knew it was in Winfield, though never seen the place.  It&#39;s right in downtown Winfield near the train station, hospital, etc.  It&#39;s a cute little place for sure!  Simple menu here...pretzels &amp; soup.

They have a &#34;pretzel of the day&#34; and &#34;soup of the day&#34; ...the day I was there, it was Italian Beef.  I have to say this thing was AMAZING!  It&#39;s a large pretzel stuffed with Italian Beef and very filling! That&#39;s all I needed for lunch!  There are also regular &#34;daily&#34; pretzels for sale, my friend ordered the hot dog pretzel, also day old pretzels on clearance, pretzel bread, pretzel chips, etc.  There is even an interesting dessert menu...which I need to try one of these days when I&#39;m allowing myself a &#34;cheat day&#34;!!!  Oh wait...they sell cookies too, which looked very appealing and I was very tempted, but declined.

As others have mentioned, there are only two seats indoors, we ate in the car...which was totally fine, but this is definitely a &#34;to-go&#34; place."

What&#39;s not to love about this fabulous little shack o&#39; deliciousness? It&#39;s small, it&#39;s local, it&#39;s fresh, it&#39;s active on social media, it&#39;s owned by people who have the cuuuuutest French bulldog, and most importantly: they do one thing, and they do it really, really well. 

I had first heard of Gnarly Knots through Facebook, where they advise eagerly awaiting fans of their weekly specials and up and coming offers. Maybe I&#39;m a giant nerd but I LOVE this idea. It&#39;s what roped me in. Every week I watched the Facebook page for a flavor I couldn&#39;t live without, which was when I wanted to dive in and try one of these famed pretzels. Unfortunately, the hype is real, and so are the lines to wait for these special pretzels. So I went with a backup plan, and when I was on vacation in a weekday, scurried over to try the deliciousness with no wait!

It really is kind of a shack - a teensy tiny shack that would be pretty easy to miss if I hadn&#39;t been stalking it for weeks. I parked, climbed the stairs, and walked in to the smell of fresh made pretzel heaven. I ordered a Monterey Jack stuffed pretzel and a cinnamon sugar with cinnamon creme dipping sauce. My order was ready in .000034 seconds and I jumped in the car to head home and eat.

Typically, pretzels aren&#39;t my favorite foods, but I tell you these are pretzels done RIGHT. Soft, fresh, warm, chewy... They&#39;re perfect. The cheese stuffed pretzel was loaded with gooey melted cheese and was a salty, decadent delight. The cinnamon sugar pretzel was a perfect sweet ending to my meal, and I could have eaten about four of the cinnamon creme sauces. So good.

I came back this past weekend just to ensure I was appropriately in love with this place and tried their Italian sausage stuffed pretzel dog with provolone cheese and a side of marinara. AMAZING. But the most amazing?! Their PRETZEL bread pudding loaded with apples and creme anglaise! Brilliant, innovative, decadent, and addicting. Who knew pretzels could be so much fun?! 

If all you know of soft pretzels is movie theaters and baseball games, do yourself a favor and get over to Gnarly Knots. Let them elevate pretzels for you and change your mind for good. And also try to spy their adorable pooch while you&#39;re there, because the only thing in my world that can make a 5-star establishment better is a love of cute canines!"

There are tables and seats outside and u can eat inside to but there are only 2 seats. Never had a bad experience just think they need to work on making the special pretzels taste better  
All in all good nice cute spot to come with the family 

Buffalo chicken pretzel: the pretzel texturally is really good not soggy not to hard. The filling was really good there was alot of chicken but since they fried it it became really soggy like mush like u know when u eat can vegetables and u can squish them  in ur hand and they completely  disintegrate. So they should have grilled it or panfried it The dipping sauce was also really good i ate all of it its that cant believe its not butter with buffalo sauce. I just wish they would fill the whole pretzel up cUse when u finish ur left with alot of pretzel

Cookie doe pretzel :this was really could i was skeptical because alot of people use cheap chocolate thats not that good but it was really good. It was really like eating cookie doe from a bowl. Again they need to fill the whole thing up with the ingredient because u end up with alot of pretzel left over n a dipping sauce would have been perfect.

Italian pretzel provolone cheese with marinara sauce: picture a gormea pretzel dog. It was really good the spices on top were really delicious wish there was some on the bottom or more on top. The actual sausage was really tender. It was a plain sausage i wish it would have been a spicy one. They needed to grill it because i think it tastes better if they cant grill it then panfry it for some texture. Regarding the marinara sauce it was cold they should have warmed it up it was a really plain sauce nothing special alot of oregano 

Pretzel bread pudding: the texture of it was good not to dry could be a lil more moist though. when i was eating it i didnt see alot of apples in it. The sauce is like a cinnamon bun with cinnamon in it though i didnt really care for the sauce on it wasnt my favorite i was expecting something really amaizin and different wouldnt order again."

Fresh made pretzels daily, when the sell out, they close.  Each day they have a different &#34;stuffed pretzel&#34; among their normal rotation.  On Saturday they have one sweet special and one savory.

We missed out on the daily special (they go quick) so we ordered the garlic Parmesan.  That&#39;s a good pretzel!  We also tried the sweet option, which was a pretzel bread pudding.  I don&#39;t recall the exact flavor, but it was great!

1. The pretzels are absolutely fabulous and are very unique! They even offer sweet AND savory pretzels. My personal favorites include the Cookie Dough stuffed pretzel and the Bacon Mac and Cheese stuffed pretzel. 
2. The only problems with this place are that there are limited amounts of their &#34;specials&#34; for the day, so we have to wait in line for about forty minutes to insure that we receive those specific pretzels. In addition, it is very small with limited space to wait indoors, so if the weather is not cooperating that day, it might not be the best time to get a pretzel.

For the same price as a pretzel at the nationwide chains, you can get a hearty and delicious pretzel plain, or with several toppings.  They do daily specials of pretzels and soup.  All in a quaint location.  If you&#39;re craving a pretzel, this is the place to go."

I had the Pepperoni Pizza for lunch.  The regular pretzels are thick, maybe 2-3 times the size of those mall pretzels, so the stuffed pretzels are even more monstrous.  It came with a side of marinara sauce for dipping.

I also tried the Cinnamon Sugar pretzel, which wasn&#39;t anything special.  It needed more cinnamon and sugar!  The savory stuffed pretzels are the star of the show here.  

They also give out free mini pretzels on National Pretzel Day - who knew there was such a thing?

Bonus points for stocking Blood Orange Pellegrino in the cooler.

I feel like this place is sort of in the middle of nowhere, but it&#39;s not.  The business is located in an old, charming white house, near Central DuPage Hospital.  Their hours are really limited, so you have to go during the day or on the weekend.  So if you have your heart set on the day&#39;s special, get there early in case they sell out.

So it&#39;s a tiny joint in Winfield that has some out door seating and two bar stools inside.  But from what I have seen and experienced, it&#39;s hard to even make it back to your car once you have to goods in your hand.

They have your regular slated pretzel, which, if you know anything about pretzels...t requires yellow mustard!  These pretzels are tasty and just the right amount of salt and chew on the &#39;skin&#39; of the pretzel.  You can purchase cheese dip and other dips.  The cheese dip is good.

They have a few other pretzels that have some cheese on the outside of them, great as well.

Now the &#39;stuffed&#39; pretzels....they serve a fixed stuffed pretzel menu every day...one kind of stuffed pretzel each day of the week.  The bottom part of the pretzel is what is stuffed.  The Porker is lick your lips delicious, Jack cheese stuffed is amazing....

On Saturdays they have a &#39;wild card&#39; stuffed pretzel that you can get hints about what it will be on Facebook.  

It&#39;s not just a pretzel!!!!!"

The first day we went here, it was a &#34;pretzel dog&#34; with an italian sausage. He got an oreo cheesecake stuffed pretzel. We have been back a handful of times, but that visit remains our favorite. The italian dog was just the right amount of juicy and delicious.

Other pretzels we have enjoyed include: tuxedo white chocolate cake, bacon/tator tot, italian beef, gyro, meatball/mozzarella, and caramel apple stuffed. They were all delicious. 

Follow them on Facebook and you can find out what their special stuffed pretzel is on Friday, for Saturday."

I had the cinnamon sugar today.  I did not cared for it it was too tuff to chew or bite into it.  I love the Italian beef it is amazing. It comes with beef juice on the side and hot gardinera it is a meal on its on.  The pulled pork with grilled onions is delicious.  The French onion soup is ok a little too sour for me.

This might actually be my definition of heaven. As soon as I saw this place come across my Yelp feed, I bookmarked it for a visit. Yes, I actually drove about an hour round-trip to eat a pretzel, and it was totally worth it.

First let me say that I love the whole idea of this place. I checked out their website shortly after seeing it here, and their story is great. A true little community support success story. It is nice to see, and I feel even better to help support that too.

A little about the place - I see that it often gets quite crowded, though we didn&#39;t have that issue during our visit (around 12:30 on a Saturday). There were other people there, but we didn&#39;t have to wait in line and they had plenty of hot fresh pretzels ready. They have two parking lots available, so plenty of space, though the restaurant itself is very tiny. It is a walk-up establishment with a tiny indoor waiting area and a counter for eating that only seats about 2-3 people. It is a converted house, so most of the space is in the back for cooking the food. They do have a few tables outside though, if the weather is nice and you want to &#34;dine in.&#34; I think they probably get much of their business from CDH, which is right across the intersection.

They have a variety of tasty pretzels (obviously) but also soup, cookies, and pretzel buns to go. Check out their menu or their Facebook page for their daily specials, since the pretzels available rotate each day. They also have special stuffed pretzels on Saturday. My husband and I both tried the classic salted pretzel, with jalapeno cheese dip. It was great! The size is generous, and it is served warm. It isn&#39;t overly salted, and tastes delicious. I&#39;d definitely like to go back to try their other types, especially the stuffed, but wanted to stay traditional for our first visit. If you love pretzels, you&#39;ve got to try these guys out!"

Apparently the line started to form at 10:30 but our group didn&#39;t make it until 11:30 and weren&#39;t too far back in line. 

Once the doors opened, things seemed to move pretty fast. My only complaint is because the shop is so small, crowds had little room to move while waiting for their food.

These specialty pretzels are totally worth their $6 price tag. Considering these were my first stuffed pretzel, I was surprised to see only the bottom was stuffed. But I can&#39;t blame them, stuffing the entire thing would be a major pain in the ass. 

The beef brisket was phenomenal. I seriously want their brisket recipe. This thing was stuffed full too, no skimping on the meat. 

The Oreo cheesecake was really good, not sure if I&#39;d get it again. I love cheesecake and maybe it was because it was warm, the cheesecake had a different texture but the taste was definitely there. 

I also tried their original pretzel chips. They were average. Less salty than the ones you get in the grocery store but I&#39;m happy to support local businesses."

Large, delicious pretzels filled with ooey goodness like lemon cookie dough and Cajun chicken (two pretzel options-savory and sweet)! The lines moves fast, the menu is simple with 4-6 kinds of pretzels to choose from. It was perfect for a day you crave a hot soft pretzel and even better that the pretzels are excellent quality. They also have a soup menu so you can make a proper meal out of your stop. If they add homemade lemonade for the summer (hint) I&#39;d become a regular pretty quickly. Do check this out for yourself, it is worth the stop and will likely be a hit with the kids as well."

After seeing Heidi K&#39;s review on the 3rd, I knew that I&#39;d need to make a visit stat. I talked to one of my friends whom, much like me, is always down for a good road trip. We decided to head here this past Tuesday. 

I was already aware of the mnimal seating from prior reviews but it was a nice day out, so at the very least- I knew we could just bask in the sun and hang out on the curb.  We were fortunate enough to grab the one and only patio table right as someone else was heading out. Woohoo!

I ordered the french onion soup and the POTD (pretzel of the day.. I just made that up) which was salami and provolone. I asked the girl working what her recommendation was on sauce and she said the mustard. My friend ordered the cheese topped with nacho cheese, as well as a soup. Our total was around $18 which I thought was a good price. Also, the girl working was really friendly. 

My pretzel was heaven on earth. The dough itself was perfect and the salami inside was sooo good. The mustard really complemented the pretzel well and I ended up using all of it. I honestly could have ordered two mustards that&#39;s how good they were. 

They list their daily pretzels and soups on the website, so make sure to check it out. I also found out from perusing their site that they will be on Chicago&#39;s Best soon. 

The only docked star is they REALLY need a bigger place soon. We came in around 1 PM and there wasn&#39;t much room to stand to wait for our pretzel. Hopefully they&#39;re so successful that they expand to a 2nd location soon!"

Due to their hours, I was only able to check them out on Saturday (and that goes for repeat visits in the future as well), which was a bit of a headache.

You see, unlike the size of their pretzels, GN and its lot are small. It took me a few attempts to park. I first pulled in to find no parking. So I left and came back about an hour later and managed to snag the last open spot. 
Then there&#39;s the shop itself. Folks, there&#39;s no dining in here. There&#39;s a picnic table out back, a small bistro table near the door, and a tiny bar with two stools right when you walk in, but that&#39;s it. Grab your pretzel n&#39; move along. The line was out the door but luckily it moved fairly quickly. 

Once inside, I noticed today&#39;s specials were the oreo and cheesecake pretzel, and the tator tot, bacon, and cheese pretzel. Say what?!?! Oreo and cheesecake in a pretzel? Bacon, tator tots AND cheese?! Sweet mother of jesus... why have I NOT attempted to visit here sooner? I knew immediately the tator tot version would be my choice (the cheesecake wouldn&#39;t have sat well with me. *sigh).

After a few minutes of standing in line, it was finally my turn to order. I ordered the above mentioned special and a bottle of water. The total came out to a little over $8. Quite the sticker shock, but I quickly got over it and paid. I received my pretzel (hot and fresh from the oven, nonetheless) and made my way back to my car.

I opened the bag and once I saw the size of the pretzel, the price tag justified the product. Fans of Auntie Anne&#39;s, take note- those &#34;pretzel perfect pretzels everytime&#34; don&#39;t stand a chance to Gnarly Knots. First of all these pretzels are HUGE. They are stuffed with delicious goodies. They are thick, soft, chewy, and bursting with flavor (depending on what you get, of course). Secondly, if you neglected to eat the pretzel the day you purchased it (blasphemy!), its rock hard structure could easily be used days later to ward off a carjacker or rabid animal attack. Okay, maybe not, but I wouldn&#39;t rule it out completely.

Gnarly Knots has won me over; hands down they have the best pretzels ever. It&#39;s too bad I&#39;m not in the immediate neighborhood anymore; although a hop, skip, and a jump better suits my waistline and wallet, anyway."

I&#39;ve been all twisted up because last Friday; my wife Lisa and I were going to go here from her appointment at Central DuPage... Unfortunately, her appointment ran late and I had to run to my next appointment. So she went to Gnarly Knot&#39;s without me! She had a cheese pretzel and french onion soup.. said it was excellent... (insert eyeroll)

Lisa was asking what I wanted to do for lunch today... she threw ou a couple of ideas.. so me (feeling a bit salty) said that I might just run over to Gnarly Knots later.

&#34;I want to go&#34; was her reply... and so it was..

Today (Wednesday) is BRISKET Stuffed Pretzel day. Yup, you read that right. 

So that&#39;s what we got, along with the Garlic Mashed Potato Soup, a Big Honking Chocolate Chip Cookie of Delightfulness, a container of their Chili (frozen, for later) and two bags of their Pretzel Chips.

The pretzels were crazy good, as was the soup.

They only have one special a day, but I could happily eat any and all of them, I&#39;m knotty that way."

Well the stars aligned and I took my chance. I ordered the Italian beef and the cinnamon sugar with a side of the cinnamon creme dipping sauce. 

Italian beef - this thing was delicious, loaded with very tasty Italian beef, it came with a side of hot gardinera and au jus. I would highly recommend this pretzel to anyone. 8/10

Cinnamon sugar - this one on the other hand was quite bland, even with the cinnamon creme dip. I am a huge fan of cinnamon raisin bagels. I wanted this to be the cinnamon crunch bagel from panera, lots of flavor on the top and tiny pockets of cinnamon goo throughout the pretzel. What it seemed like was a standard pretzel that someone dropped in a bucket of cinnamon sugar topping. I would give this a 4/10 

Would I go back? Yes, but only for the daily specials and to try the soups."

I spent 24 years in the Philadelphia area, at least 23 of which were pretzel-eating years. These Gnarly Knots pretzels are something that would be appreciated back East, and not just here in the Midwest where we are pretzel-deprived.

The way the shop works is, there are everyday offerings and one special, stuffed offering each day of the week. I had scoured the website to learn the schedule, as well as that the shop produces only a limited batch of pretzels each day. I now understand that Gnarly Knots has a Facebook page as well, so that&#39;s another good source for updates. 

We made it on brisket day, and before the shop ran out, so we enjoyed one stuffed pretzel and two Bavarian (regular) style. Perfectly crisped on the outside, perfectly fluffy and doughy on the inside...these pretzels are something to write home about. 

The space is quite small, but I appreciate that I could at least get in and out with my babe in her stroller. I don&#39;t think they have a restroom, so of course I had to take my son out to pee in the nearby woods while we were there.

My sister says four stars for the lack of an eat-in area (there&#39;s just a tiny bar with two stools). But in fairness, their website clearly tries to dissuade customers from lingering in the tiny space, so I can&#39;t really blame the place. It is what it is, so I say five stars, but it would be nice if they could someday expand to include at least a small dining area. I look forward to going back on pepperoni day and cheeseburger day to enjoy the other stuffed pretzel masterpieces."

Stuffed Pretzel: Pork Burrito that day: awesome! Tender pork, black beans, rice and a side of sour cream.  Cracked out Chipolte, lol 
How did they get that in there?!?

All I have to say is UH-MAY-ZING. Truly.

Our first visit was the pork burrito stuffed pretzel. I have to admit, when I read that day&#39;s special I was not impressed. In fact, it didn&#39;t sound appealing to me at all. But, we were dying to give this place a try and we weren&#39;t sure when we&#39;d get another opportunity to get there (it&#39;s probably about a 35-40 minute drive) so we went.

And I am SO GLAD we did. I tried that pork burrito stuffed and it was .... no words. Just fantastic. The flavor was excellent. Everything about it was great.

This past weekend we stopped in for the chicken parmesan stuffed. It, too, was delicious, but so far that pork burrito remains the #1 choice (but, I&#39;ve only been lucky enough to try 2 of the many kinds they make...).

We&#39;ve also tried the chocolate croissant pretzel as well as the lemon cookie. Both were also very, very good. But, for the price -- I&#39;d almost rather buy another stuffed and forgo the dessert.

Can&#39;t wait to go again -- I&#39;ve got my eyes on the gyro, italian beef, bbq brisket and reuben stuffed!!"

I got the Black Forrest cake pretzel. There was a big chunk of chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and cherries. My son got the regular salted pretzel and my husband got the pretzel dog. The pretzel dog was really really good too. It&#39;s almost an hour from home for us but I think we will probably try to make it out here more often to try the others.

I love small, local businesses that do what they do, well!  It&#39;s near downtown Winfield, in a small house that is buzzing with people.  I can see why.

It is tiny, with no indoor seating, but really cute.  You get what you want and go.  They do have a picnic table, maybe 2 outside, but I&#39;m sure most people eat it in their cars or take it to go.  

They have a limited menu and a special stuffed pretzel of the day.  They say get there early, because you might not get one if you get there too late.  We got there in time to get one of the special Monterey Jack cheese stuffed.  OMG was it good!  That little bit chewy on the outside, tender on the inside and it seemed like there was a pound of beautiful, gooey cheese inside.  It really was perfection!

We also got a couple Pretzel Dogs.  They put the jumbo beef hot dogs in there.  I just loved it.  I bet they have dipping sauces for these, but when you&#39;re a newbie and overly excited about everything, we forgot to ask or look, but even if there are sauces, they were delicious without anything at all!  I just looked at their website.  They have sauces.  Big dummy here. 

We shared one of the cinnamon sugar pretzels.  This was my least favorite and only because I felt like it was missing some icing or something.  And again.. probably my fault for not looking around.. cause I&#39;m a spaz like that.

It&#39;s obvious they use quality ingredients and put a lot of care into their product.  If it wasn&#39;t hot, today, I would love to try some of their soup, sometime.  I bet it&#39;s just as good as their pretzels!

Will come back, for sure!"

They&#39;ve expanded their menu so their daily pretzel of the day changes more frequently and that is a good thing.  Pulled pork stuffed pretzel?  Yep!  Cheese stuffed pretzel?  Yep!  Italian Sausage stuffed pretzel?  Yep!  A Vienna beef dog wrapped in pretzel dough?  Yep! You get the picture.

They also do a variety of soups.  I hear they are quite good but for me it is all about the carb laden stuffed wonderment of a pretzel that gets me every time.  Don&#39;t forget to get a side of mustard sauce made with creme fraiche.  Delicious!

I love seeing the line outside the door on Saturday mornings.  During nice weather, it takes on a carnival like atmosphere with folks tossing footballs and frisbees.  You cannot help but smile when you see that!

As others have noted, this is a little house and the kitchen takes up pretty much all the space.  So grab your pretzel to go and thank the pretzel God for creating this wonderful little indie place."

Today&#39;s (Tuesday) special wasn&#39;t something that appealed so I went with the cinnamon sugar instead..a can&#39;t miss.  I also had a bite of my sons standard salt pretzel.  
The dough in both was very good.  Fresh, soft and warm..a trio that every pretzel should have.  The cinnamon sugar cover was a tad lacking.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it tasted fine, but there wasn&#39;t enough cinnamon or sugar for my liking.
We also got one of the big monster cookies.  That was pretty awesome.  Chocolate chip with pretzel chips..you get the sweet and sour..the best of both worlds.
Gnarly has a lot of interesting daily specials that I&#39;d like to give a whirl.  I&#39;m thinking once I do, my rating goes up.  Cheers."

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever eaten a pretzel that hasn&#39;t been from a chain store and I&#39;m loving it! I wasn&#39;t feeling a stuffed pretzel so this review will be for their unstuffed ones.

I got the cheese topped and cinnamon pretzels. The pretzel itself it as good as it gets. Huge pretzel so you get what you pay for and texture is perfect. My only wish is that the cinnamon one had more cinnamon-sugar on it.

Along with the pretzels, I ordered the nacho cheese sauce and cinnamon creme sauce. I wasn&#39;t a fan of these. I don&#39;t know if they make it themselves or not. Nacho cheese was pretty typical but the cinnamon creme tasted like sour horchata to me. It wasn&#39;t a bad sour, like they added lemon juice, but it was just kind of odd in that sort of dipping sauce. I think the pretzels taste the best without the sauces.

I&#39;m definitely curious about their stuffed pretzels. I&#39;ll visit sometime again and try those out. Also, I heard that they sometimes serve pretzel croissants! Oh, I need to try that one.

Side note: I think it&#39;s funny that people complain about how many pretzels they make and their odd hours. Yeah, it&#39;s weird, but they aren&#39;t a chain. I also think it makes them more popular to only have a limited amount of stuffed pretzels. It&#39;s smart of them. Not saying I know how businesses are run, but I can see why they do it. So how about we stop complaining about it and keep supporting this local business? Maybe they&#39;ll have better hours if they had more money for a bigger location."

This is a mainly a takeout place, but they do have a few outdoor seats for when the weather is nice. And they only offer a few types of pretzels each, so check their menu ahead of time.

I&#39;m partial to the stuffed pretzels, and the rest of the family seems to prefer the more traditional ones.  The soups have been very good too, as have the pretzel dogs.

The way this place works is a bit &#34;different&#34; though:
1) Expect a bit of a wait when they first open.  They are popular, and since they have been known to run out, sometimes there is a line out the door and into the parking lot.  Even when it is 10 degrees out...
2) This is a small house with a &#34;pretzel kitchen&#34; inside.  Don&#39;t expect a dine-in experience.  While there is a bathroom (our 4yr-old had an &#34;emergency,&#34;) it is clearly not intended for public use.  The design is, quite simply, &#34;Get your pretzel and head on out!&#34;
3) The menu is simple.  The specialty pretzels and soups rotate - check the Facebook page for details.  Basic pretzels are always available.
4) Shockingly tasty!"

You can only order a minimum of 6 of their daily special, even paying 3 days in advance.  Selling out before closing time is understandable but not being able to preorder 5 to-go seems counterproductive.
My first visit was just at closing time (as they suggest on phone), to get 4 of the daily special since I couldn&#39;t pre order that morning.  It was the pepperoni stuffed one, which was really good.  They did have a small number of (daily) stock left.  Not sure if they are banking on the exclusivity and word-of-mouth of short supply, but that certainly doesn&#39;t keep them at the top of my food choice since there&#39;s no certainty of getting any product.  

The service is decent and I feel the prices are in line with the uniqueness of the product.  My 3 visits must have been off peak hours as I&#39;ve never waited in line or seen more that one other customer there.  I have heard of the lines but have not experienced it myself.

Ive been back twice since and the food is very good.  The italian beef as well as the gyros stuffed are great and really filling.  Had the cheddar soup with the italian beef...too much food but a great dip for the non-stuffed part of the pretzel.  Some day I&#39;ll get there for the brisket."

And a sister-in-law willing to pick it up and bring it in (thanks, Jess!).  As soon as she walked in the door I was handing over the baby and mangia&#39;ing on some HUGE delicious pretzels.  The daily special was the stuffed cheese one and it was amazing.  The stuffing ends up being in one section of the pretzel and doesn&#39;t go throughout the whole thing, but the pretzel by itself is awesome too so it works out.  The cheese dipping sauce (because apparently I like to dip my cheese in more cheese) was kind of spicy but it was also really good.  Next time I&#39;m in the area (hopefully not because I&#39;m at the hospital) I will certainly be stopping by for another try.

I feel like there is much room to improve, and that&#39;s a good thing! I was impressed with how friendly the people were in the shop and with the overall presentation of the food.

The pretzels are fresh and hot. We tried the Bavarian, cheese and pretzel dog. The pretzel dog was AWESOME! I had a mustard cream dipping sauce with it which was light flavor and went well with the dog. The cheese pretzel tasted just like the Bavarian pretzel, just with crunchy cheese on top, which didn&#39;t affect the flavor. And the Bavarian was a good size, good flavor and just enough salt.

Gotta go back sometime to try the stuffed pretzels, but it&#39;s a little difficult with the limited hours."

I have worked in food service and think both, that this is disgusting, and it seems to have been either be part of a hair net or part of what was holding ingredients before they went into the pretzel. yuck. 

That said, the pretzel was good enough that I will try again. I hope they also pick up production (not an easy task, I&#39;m sure) so they can accommodate customers rather than restricting how many pretzels we can buy.

Also there really is almost no seating so I would plan on carry out, especially if it&#39;s not a nice day.

Driven here by a Yelp email, I drove by after work to see if they had any pretzels left. As it turns out, they did, but none of the pork-flavored specialty pretzels that I was hoping for. Instead they had three standard pretzels and two pretzels roughly the size of a large pizza at Lou Malnati&#39;s.

I&#39;m a rational guy, so I got two regular pretzels. Auntie Anne&#39;s is nice, but in the end they&#39;re little better than something you might get in a can; these pretzels might have had beer in their batter, for all I know; that&#39;s how much yeast was in them. And the outsides were perfectly leathery, while the insides weren&#39;t tough at all; soft, warm and awesomeness in a knot.

I had two toppings; a hot cheese topping that was nice and spicy, and a mustard-creme fraiche cold topping, which stepped around my dislike of mustard by being both mustardy and sour.

The service seemed a bit slow and considering how not busy they were I would have expected quicker service. However this wouldn&#39;t change my mind about coming here again. The location is private but walkable from my place which is great!

Now, the food..... that was great! I ordered the Chopped Cobb Salad with no avocado. My only negative is I would have liked the tomatoes a bit more sliced (or Chopped up) but I enjoyed it nevertheless. My friend ordered breakfast for dinner (they serve breakfast ALL day which is awesome). He had two eggs, with shredded hashbrowns and two fluffy pancakes.

So good and cooked perfectly. They didn&#39;t skimp on the egg whites. Had their green salsa on the side it&#39;s homemade. Hash browns nice and crispy.  The bread pudding was warm with whipped cream topping. My boyfriend had a Cobb salad and it was large. I&#39;m definitely coming back.

Stopped for breakfast the other day and was very disappointed. The coffee tasted horrible and they charge you $2.85 for it. I think they must use well water as it had that taste to it. I ordered 2 eggs with ham and fruit. The small bowl of fruit looked like it was days old. I didn&#39;t even want to try it. The eggs were tiny. When the waitress asked how things were i told her the coffee tasted horrible and the fruit looked spoiled. Her response was the owner buys very expensive coffee and she didn&#39;t know why the fruit looked like that. The total bill was just under $15.00. They did end up deducting the coffee.

Stay away from this place."

The plus is, the food here is quite good with good flavors, portion sizes, and prices. The small negatives are that the open layout lends itself to potentially being noisy, plates could be cleared faster, menu layout could be improved, and the kitchen can get too busy at times. With that said, the strength of the food is enough to overcome these small issues.

The loaded fries here are delicious, a huge portion of crispy fries topped with cheese, green onion, sour cream, and bacon. Enough to make one full before they start a meal, even when sharing with several other people.

Linguine with garlic shrimp -- Generous portion of (6 large) shrimp with a delicious creamy sauce, asparagus, and sun dried tomatoes. The sauce was slightly thick for me but still delicious.

Not-your-mother&#39;s-mac &#39;n cheese with Andouille sausage: Nice bouncy texture on the pasta with melted Swiss, smoked gouda &amp; cheddar cheeses. Topped with baked parmesan bread crumbs. Not as salty as one would believe with 4 types of cheeses that work together well. The slight sear to make the andouille sausage crisp was a nice touch.

Classic benedict: Nice crisp hash browns and perfectly poached egg. I really enjoyed the hollandaise sauce which was smooth and creamy but not very salty so it did not distract from the other elements of the dish.

Cafe burger with truffle chips: Not bad, but nothing special for a burger. The truffle chips were a little on the soft side but had a flavorful seasoning.

Overall, the more unique menu and execution of dishes that&#39;s offered at Grove Kitchen is worth returning for although a few improvements to the customer experience to complement the food would easily get this restaurant many more 4 and 5 star reviews."

The service at Grove Kitchen is PAINFULLY slow and inattentive. Our server had the personality of the walking dead. We both ordered omelette switch pancakes. Mine were cooked perfectly; my husbands were undercooked and served without powdered sugar. (Lack is attention and detail)
Good luck getting a refill in your coffee. 
Our bill came and I was charged for a fountain drink and my husband was charged for a coffee. (We both had coffee). We are undecided if we will return here. Hmmm maybe back to Le Peep. They do breakfast correctly."

To our surprise and delight after hearing some negative buzz and seeing the emptiness of the place at 10am Saturday, this place was great.

As already mentioned, since place was maybe half occupied, we didn&#39;t have to wait and were seated promptly. They serve Intelligentsia coffee which is great. Our service overall was pretty good. Waters and coffees were refilled when necessary, food came out at an appropriate time, and our server was nice and friendly.

I got a skillet with chicken sausage, gruyere, and jalapenos ($10.5 skillets including 3 ingredients). The sausage was abundant. Everything tasted fresh. Over easy eggs were cooked to perfection. The only slightly iffy thing was that the hash browns could have been browned a bit more. Nonetheless, all was tasty. Pancakes were fine, but are better at other places mentioned. Some biscuits and gravy connoisseurs at the table said that theirs was a definite standout and may be one of the best that they have ever had. In particular, they noted the biscuits to be actual fresh flaky buttermilk biscuits. The rancheros benedict special was also a hit.

Overall, food was quite good and tasted much fresher than the Red Apple. I didn&#39;t feel as lethargic afterwards as I normally do at some of these other places. Service was pretty good. Place was spacious and open. Atmosphere was fine. Nice addition to P-town."

Was warmed welcome once walked in. Asked if seating was good for me for what they picked. Was immediately served bread and water. 

Saw that they had broccolli cheddar soup. I had to have to try it. It was very good. Not overwhelming cheese flavor and plenty bits of broccoli in each bite. Loved it.  Was only 4.50 for a huge bowl. Not going to complain at all! 

Next. I had pretzel bun burger ordered rare. It was perfectly cooked. Fries were delish as well. It did not taste prefrozen at all. It was all  for 10.00

Service was very perfect and atmosphere was mellow and laid backed. Relaxing night for a friday night. The waitress was awesome and friendly. Checking in on right times not when I had food in my mouth or hoovering around. Customers all were relaxed around me. 

Definitely a better food fare than Alemars."

Order was simple, eggs over easy, bacon crisp, hashbrowns and wheat toast. Food took about 15 minutes to come out, which for the amount of people in the restaurant and how simple my order was, should not have taken that long. Food was not hot when it came out, like the serve forgot to pick it up so it jusy sat out. Eggs were over cooked, bacon was under cooked and the hashbrowns had no flavor.

The first weekend in a long time with out the kids to enjoy breakfast together. We sat down and waited nearly 20 minutes before our waitress came to take our order. When she finally came back with our food about another 20 minutes had past...mind you they were not that busy. One of our orders was wrong. When we pointed out the error they offered to correct it...however my fiance was most of the way done before the manager came over. I suggested that I was not interested in getting my breakfast remade due to the fact we would both have eaten our breakfast alone. My request was ignored and they brought the new skillet back and it was wrong too. We then sat there for another 20 minutes with empty drinks and the waitress seemed at this point to be ignoring us. I was still waiting on the hot sauce I had requested. 

The manager did not charge us for the skillet boxed it up and insisted that we take it home. Yet it was still wrong. We both decided that the restaurant had a pleasant atmosphere...however it did not make up for the extremely poor service, inability to get an order right...and their ability to make a bad situation worse by charging us $12.50 for a skillet. 

If you are into over priced, poor service and being ignored....this may be the place for you.

Needless to say we will most likely never visit again.

I tend to like my eggs and bacon served hot not moderately warm and, my table un-sticky. Could just be me. The bus boy was polite and the waitress was friendly. Oh, and the music is horrible!

Great outdoor dining service and food two weeks ago. Bad experience today for lunch. Today, fries were cold but ham and cheese sandwich was hot and delicious (even though the kitchen didn&#39;t add mustard instead of mayo as I requested) when it arrived and the server seemed to be missing steps in our dining experience today. We first sat, unnoticed, it seemed, for 7-8 minutes.  No water, no nothing. Server walks up and asks if we&#39;re ready to order. Well, by that time we were, considering all the time we&#39;d had to look at our menus! First thing we did was order...you guessed it...water.

Here&#39;s the deal: It&#39;s always clean and the bussing staff are top-notch, always on it. My struggle is that we dine here and it&#39;s pretty good.  Then we dine here and it&#39;s really not.  Yes, we keep coming back, I know, but when it&#39;s almost next door to our house and it&#39;s the only restaurant we can walk to, we can&#39;t help but hope our visit will be a good one, ya know? I sincerely hope they can get it together soon. We&#39;ll probably be back while the weather is still good to walk, but if traveling by car is an option we wouldn&#39;t think twice about driving right past Grove Kitchen to Deer Park and a chain restaurant."

The staff could not remember the soup of the day, she didn&#39;t remember it for another two tables as well, so I kind of gave her a hint after I finished my soup of the day which could have come right out of a soup can.

The truffle chips, were potato chips with Parmesan cheese.  The adult grilled cheese didn&#39;t have any cheese.  Menu was pretty boring. Never did get the refill on the coffee

The pancake (buttermilk) were to heavy one looked a little under done.  The poached eggs where over cooked with a lot of browning.  My son who will eat any type of fries did not eat more than one because they where over done.  

Hash brown where and the scrambled eggs where good.

My request was ignored and they brought the new skillet back and it was wrong too. We then sat there for another 20 minutes with empty drinks and the waitress seemed at this point to be ignoring us. I was still waiting on the hot sauce I had requested. 

The manager did not charge us for the skillet boxed it up and insisted that we take it home. Yet it was still wrong. We both decided that the restaurant had a pleasant atmosphere...however it did not make up for the extremely poor service, inability to get an order right...and their ability to make a bad situation worse by charging us $12.50 for a skillet. 

If you are into over priced, poor service and being ignored....this may be the place for you.

Needless to say we will most likely never visit again.

Open all day from 7 am to 9 pm with a full bar. Tuesday&#39;s half price wines. They have specials for lunch and dinner everyday also serve breakfast all day. Place is very clean and they have seating outside. We have been there five times once for breakfast twice for lunch and dinner. Can&#39;t say enough about this place. Must check it out.

I might try it again for lunch if Deb is working. Was jonesing for breakfast and re-routed myself from my initial choice, Billy&#39;s. (Well, at least now I know. Keep going down NW Highway.) I tend to like my eggs and bacon served hot not moderately warm and, my table un-sticky. Could just be me. The bus boy was polite and the waitress was friendly. Oh, and the music is horrible! Blaring pop-ish dance music is as intolerable as screaming children. However, the remodeling from its former Alemar&#39;s days is a favourable diversion from the same old, same old in the area."

Great outdoor dining service and food two weeks ago. Bad experience today for lunch. Today, fries were cold but ham and cheese sandwich was hot and delicious (even though the kitchen didn&#39;t add mustard instead of mayo as I requested) when it arrived and the server seemed to be missing steps in our dining experience today. We first sat, unnoticed, it seemed, for 7-8 minutes.  No water, no nothing. Server walks up and asks if we&#39;re ready to order. Well, by that time we were, considering all the time we&#39;d had to look at our menus! First thing we did was order...you guessed it...water.

Here&#39;s the deal: It&#39;s always clean and the bussing staff are top-notch, always on it. My struggle is that we dine here and it&#39;s pretty good.  Then we dine here and it&#39;s really not.  Yes, we keep coming back, I know, but when it&#39;s almost next door to our house and it&#39;s the only restaurant we can walk to, we can&#39;t help but hope our visit will be a good one, ya know? I sincerely hope they can get it together soon. We&#39;ll probably be back while the weather is still good to walk, but if traveling by car is an option we wouldn&#39;t think twice about driving right past Grove Kitchen to Deer Park and a chain restaurant."

Went in for lunch yesterday and I know why it took so long. The place is very nice.There were four of us. I had the mac and cheese. My wife had the soup and a patty melt. Everybody commented on how good the food was. The two guys that I met there for lunch said that they went when the place first opened and it was fair. They both said that the food and the service were much better this time. I never went to a newly opened restaurant that didn&#39;t have some &#34;just opened issues&#34;. My friends work just down the street and said that this will be a regular lunch spot from now on. I loved the place. Great food and good service.

The staff could not remember the soup of the day, she didn&#39;t remember it for another two tables as well, so I kind of gave her a hint after I finished my soup of the day which could have come right out of a soup can.

The truffle chips, were potato chips with Parmesan cheese.  The adult grilled cheese didn&#39;t have any cheese.  Menu was pretty boring. Never did get the refill on the coffee

I am hoping that they can work out all the kinks management was on-hand and really seemed to be trying, but they really need a rewrite and a decorator.."

I ordered pancakes, my wife had poached eggs.  We have two kids and they had chicken fingers and fries and scrambled eggs.  

They only gave two settings and three water for 4 people.  They brought another setting but it was dirty and they had to replace it.  

The pancake (buttermilk) were to heavy one looked a little under done.  The poached eggs where over cooked with a lot of browning.  My son who will eat any type of fries did not eat more than one because they where over done.  

Hash brown where and the scrambled eggs where good.

The service was very slow our waiter took his time.  I had to wait 15 minutes to get the check.

The decor was nice, a clean look but the look takes a back seat to the food and the food was as I said, average.  

Maybe they have some dish that is truly special, a signature entree but I wasn&#39;t made aware of it ... also, $2.50 for a cup of Intelligentsia Coffee is crazy, go to costco and buy starbucks Italian roast and I&#39;ll give you $2.50!

She ordered an egg white omelette while I got the Seared Ahi Tuna Wrap. Both meals were good. The omelette was on par with any other breakfast restaurant and yes, it was slightly pricey, but they seem to use a lot of organic ingredients and cage-free eggs, which personally, I don&#39;t mind paying a dollar or two extra for. I was pleasantly surprised with my wrap, being that tuna can be a risk. It seemed fresh and the wasabi dressing they had with it was really good. 


As for appearance, I was a fan of the modern decor, my mom not so much. It seemed like something you&#39;d see at a trendy bar downtown, a little odd for this type of restaurant, but not bothersome. Our waiter was average... not super friendly but not un-friendly, either.

Overall based on my experience, I&#39;d come back here again. Plus, it&#39;s nice to have options in Palatine, especially since there aren&#39;t many sit down restaurants in that area of the town."

Another ordered the chicken francese - lightly breaded chicken with a side of broccolini and mashed potates.  I had the grilled salmon with spinach.  I had asked to have broccolini in place of the rice, but got both - no worries even though they charged me for the extra vegetable.  My husband had the rice, so nothing went to waste.  The salmon was large enough so I&#39;ll have a nice treat tomorrow.  Huge salads came as part of our meal (not that common anymore, so that was a nice surprise).

She ordered an egg white omelette while I got the Seared Ahi Tuna Wrap. Both meals were good. The omelette was on par with any other breakfast restaurant and yes, it was slightly pricey, but they seem to use a lot of organic ingredients and cage-free eggs, which personally, I don&#39;t mind paying a dollar or two extra for. I was pleasantly surprised with my wrap, being that tuna can be a risk. It seemed fresh and the wasabi dressing they had with it was really good. 


As for appearance, I was a fan of the modern decor, my mom not so much. It seemed like something you&#39;d see at a trendy bar downtown, a little odd for this type of restaurant, but not bothersome. Our waiter was average... not super friendly but not un-friendly, either.

Overall based on my experience, I&#39;d come back here again. Plus, it&#39;s nice to have options in Palatine, especially since there aren&#39;t many sit down restaurants in that area of the town."

Usually stop in on Sundays later in the day or evenings -

The inside is pleasantly very different from the old Alemar days - much more spacious, clean &amp; updated. Service from Seth &amp; Deb is always quick &amp; they check back with us frequently.

Then while ordering for my kids from the kids menu, I ordered the kids pizza meal with fries and the waitress says &#34;the pizza does not come with fries&#34;  So I had to show her the menu where it was printed that all kids meals come with fries including the pizza.

As with any business, if you&#39;re not ready to open, i.e. heat doesn&#39;t work, service needs training, then don&#39;t open until you&#39;re ready.

No complaints - service was good, and the food was excellent.  A little chilly inside, but not really an issue.  

One ordered Not Your Mama&#39;s mac and cheese with the bacon and sausage - delicious and a huge portion that&#39;ll make a nice lunch tomorrow.  Creamy, crispy bacon and sausage.  Another ordered the chicken francese - lightly breaded chicken with a side of broccolini and mashed potates.  I had the grilled salmon with spinach.  I had asked to have broccolini in place of the rice, but got both - no worries even though they charged me for the extra vegetable.  My husband had the rice, so nothing went to waste.  The salmon was large enough so I&#39;ll have a nice treat tomorrow.  Huge salads came as part of our meal (not that common anymore, so that was a nice surprise).  

Very satisfied and enjoyed the night out.  We haven&#39;t been here for breakfast yet, so it&#39;s now on the list!  We&#39;ll be back!"

The atmosphere is appealing and we were excited to try the food.  We ordered the mini sliders for my daughter after reading the review on the Kraft mac and pizza - sliders were delicious and homemade.  Unlike the sliders, the burgers that two of the adults ordered were not - they appeared to be packaged burgers and cooked well done, despite asking for medium.  Sounded like the over cooked meat was happening at the two tables near us.  I received the wrong sandwich (Reuben) but that was correctly quickly with the right one. Average as far as sandwiches go.  

I was watching the manger floating around and he was spending more time at the bar area mingling with someone that we thought was maybe the owner instead of checking how tables were doing in the big open area.  Saw several servers running to correct orders with the kitchen and wondered if it was the servers not catching the wrong orders or the cooks not reading them right - however, frustrating for all.   

The server asked the Manager to visit us so we could talk to him about the burgers being overcooked and my wrong order - he took the defense and the first thing said tp me was &#39;it&#39;s day 3&#39;.  Disappointing to hear because I am a customer whether it&#39;s day 3 or day 28 - we know it&#39;s day 3, we&#39;ve watched the building being remolded for quite some time however; we are still a customer and could have been a return one.  

My take on their food - pre packaged and average.  Unless this place makes a change to the quality of their food - something more homemade vs packaged, not sure it&#39;s going to make it.  If trying to be more swanky than a diner in the end, the  product should represent that!"

It&#39;s got a nice location, plenty of parking, lots of seating, but in my opinion (was there for lunch) the food was a maybe a step above going to Marianos and picking a sandwich up from their pre-mades in the deli case.....nothing special....but then again....are they trying to be?  It doesn&#39;t look like it.  The service was OK, some guy was rushing from the kitchen to take our order, but was quick....It&#39;s pretty much a basic place to get a quick bite to eat...but I&#39;ve gotten better trekking thru off beaten paths at mom and pop shops for less than half the price.  If you&#39;re going to charge a premium for some scrambled eggs and bacon, put a little more into it....but....they are paying a high rent or mortgage on a premium location on a corner like that, with some substantial overhead....I&#39;m thinking...short on the talent in the kitchen.  If you cook at home are a foodie or just appreciate and are knowledgeable of GOOD food...I&#39;m not sure you will be impressed.  3 out of 5 stars only because maybe once is not enough to rate."

My wife had the Chicken Francese and I had the Chicken Marsala.  Both were excellent.  The Francese had a nice light crust along with a light sauce, very tasty with a hint of lemon. 

My Marsala also was excellent.  A wonderful mushroom wine sauce, and you could taste the hint of wine  

Both meals were excellent.  They took long enough, maybe 15 minutes or so, to know they were made to order.  So many places today will serve a similarly named plate in 5 minutes. 

The before dinner bread plate was very taste, as were our dinner salads.  Attentive wait staff and the chef stopped by the table towards the end of meals to ask how everything was and answer a few of our questions.

First impression was very positive.  The work done inside was a significant improvement - open, airy, nice bar as you walk in.

I had a traditional breakfast (eggs, bacon, hash browns, etc.) while my wife had eggs benedict.  Both were great.  I ordered wheat toast and was served wheat pancakes.  They offered to bring me toast but I opted to try the pancakes instead.  I&#39;m glad I did because they were really good - wheat pancakes are difficult to do well in my experience.

We have been here twice. Once right before Christmas, and another time a few weeks ago. 
It&#39;s a nice looking place, clean and modern. But, again, after taking years to renovate, they couldnt get a decent heating system? Going to the bathroom is like sitting your butt on an ice cube. Tables in the east side of the restaurant are cold too. 
Their coffee? Usually I am a three cup plus one to go person- I barely finished one cup. Bitter is a good way to describe it. 
The hash browns came out overcooked but my omelette was decent. 
The truffle chips? Would be decent if they actually put anything ON the chips. 
The prices are just TOO high for a neighborhood restaurant. And it would nice if the management/owners conversed with customers rather than sitting at the front booth all the time.

I didn&#39;t like that bc it made me think that the sandwich was not made to order. The sweet potato fries seemed fresh, but they weren&#39;t very flavorful. 

Anyhoo, the food wasn&#39;t horrible, but not great either, so I probably won&#39;t be going back there - not with so many other great restaurants in the area."

It has a great atmosphere, and it&#39;s what palatine needed. Good American style food. Oh, and the sweet potato fries, are waffle fries. And well, waffle fries are amazing."

The atmosphere is appealing and we were excited to try the food.  We ordered the mini sliders for my daughter after reading the review on the Kraft mac and pizza - sliders were delicious and homemade.  Unlike the sliders, the burgers that two of the adults ordered were not - they appeared to be packaged burgers and cooked well done, despite asking for medium.  Sounded like the over cooked meat was happening at the two tables near us.  I received the wrong sandwich (Reuben) but that was correctly quickly with the right one. Average as far as sandwiches go.  

I was watching the manger floating around and he was spending more time at the bar area mingling with someone that we thought was maybe the owner instead of checking how tables were doing in the big open area.  Saw several servers running to correct orders with the kitchen and wondered if it was the servers not catching the wrong orders or the cooks not reading them right - however, frustrating for all.   

The server asked the Manager to visit us so we could talk to him about the burgers being overcooked and my wrong order - he took the defense and the first thing said tp me was &#39;it&#39;s day 3&#39;.  Disappointing to hear because I am a customer whether it&#39;s day 3 or day 28 - we know it&#39;s day 3, we&#39;ve watched the building being remolded for quite some time however; we are still a customer and could have been a return one.  

My take on their food - pre packaged and average.  Unless this place makes a change to the quality of their food - something more homemade vs packaged, not sure it&#39;s going to make it.  If trying to be more swanky than a diner in the end, the  product should represent that!"

There are just too many great places to experience for the same amount of money.  It&#39;s got a nice location, plenty of parking, lots of seating, but in my opinion (was there for lunch) the food was a maybe a step above going to Marianos and picking a sandwich up from their pre-mades in the deli case.....nothing special....but then again....are they trying to be?  It doesn&#39;t look like it.  The service was OK, some guy was rushing from the kitchen to take our order, but was quick....It&#39;s pretty much a basic place to get a quick bite to eat...but I&#39;ve gotten better trekking thru off beaten paths at mom and pop shops for less than half the price.  If you&#39;re going to charge a premium for some scrambled eggs and bacon, put a little more into it....but....they are paying a high rent or mortgage on a premium location on a corner like that, with some substantial overhead....I&#39;m thinking...short on the talent in the kitchen.  If you cook at home are a foodie or just appreciate and are knowledgeable of GOOD food...I&#39;m not sure you will be impressed.  3 out of 5 stars only because maybe once is not enough to rate."

My wife had the Chicken Francese and I had the Chicken Marsala.  Both were excellent.  The Francese had a nice light crust along with a light sauce, very tasty with a hint of lemon. 

My Marsala also was excellent.  A wonderful mushroom wine sauce, and you could taste the hint of wine  

Both meals were excellent.  They took long enough, maybe 15 minutes or so, to know they were made to order.  So many places today will serve a similarly named plate in 5 minutes. 

The before dinner bread plate was very taste, as were our dinner salads.  Attentive wait staff and the chef stopped by the table towards the end of meals to ask how everything was and answer a few of our questions.

On the way out, we asked for a menu to go so as to see the breakfast fare.  We will definitely be back."

First impression was very positive.  The work done inside was a significant improvement - open, airy, nice bar as you walk in.

I had a traditional breakfast (eggs, bacon, hash browns, etc.) while my wife had eggs benedict.  Both were great.  I ordered wheat toast and was served wheat pancakes.  They offered to bring me toast but I opted to try the pancakes instead.  I&#39;m glad I did because they were really good - wheat pancakes are difficult to do well in my experience.

Bottom line: we were both very pleased with the atmosphere, friendly service and excellent, high-quality food.  We will definitely return."

We have been here twice. Once right before Christmas, and another time a few weeks ago. 
It&#39;s a nice looking place, clean and modern. But, again, after taking years to renovate, they couldnt get a decent heating system? Going to the bathroom is like sitting your butt on an ice cube. Tables in the east side of the restaurant are cold too. 
Their coffee? Usually I am a three cup plus one to go person- I barely finished one cup. Bitter is a good way to describe it. 
The hash browns came out overcooked but my omelette was decent. 
The truffle chips? Would be decent if they actually put anything ON the chips. 
The prices are just TOO high for a neighborhood restaurant. And it would nice if the management/owners conversed with customers rather than sitting at the front booth all the time.
Probably won&#39;t revisit until I hear about a few tweaks to the building and the service."

Then the excuses started... There were no clean glasses she said. Which was clearly untrue when other tables were getting their drinks. The appetizer (flatbread) came out and was really good, about 5 minutes after the appetizer we received our drinks. The food came out next and my fries were ice cold and my sons Mac and cheese was
2 colors from sitting so long. We complained to who we assumed was the manager (tall blonde woman) she took my sons Mac and cheese and handed me a plate to put my fries on so they could be heated. This was shocking because I would expect new fries not just microwaved food. My sandwich was ok. My husband liked his soup although again the temperature was off.

First was dinner: Buffalo Chicken Wrap is made with Sriracha, not Buffalo sauce, and the Sriracha is in the ranch, not on the chicken.  Rueben sandwich had extremely tough corned beef, came out of the kitchen cold and soggy and they forgot the swiss! A rueben without swiss?  Kids pizza was over sauced and Kraft Mac n Cheese took the longest our of our 6 meals to come out of the kitchen. Fries were cold, but we did visit on the third day of business, and Tom the owner checked in on us several times.  We chalked this up to  &#39;the first week&#39; and vowed to come back.
Fast forward three weeks and we visited for breakfast.  Eggs were &#39;okay&#39;, not warm when they arrived at our table.  Hash browns tasted &#39;oily&#39; but were cooked to our asking of &#39;crispy&#39;. Overall, their breakfast menu is overpriced for the area.  Coffee is branded as Intelligesta, but at $2.95 for a cup of black coffee, even Starbucks is cheaper! 
We would love to see this restaurant do well, but the prices are a bit high for the area the kitchen could use some more training on the menu and parking lot could benefit from a redesign or expansion. 
Average Price per person: Breakfast $15, Lunch &amp; Dinner $15 without drinks.

Owner Tom, if you are reading this:  the restaurant is too NOISY!  invest in some sound absorbing tiles on the ceiling."

This place is facing an identity crisis; it can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s going to be a bistro or a diner.  As other reviews stated, the service is very hit or miss. Servers forget about the options with each dish (not that it matters because the kitchen will decide for you and by the time the food gets to you).  All three of our entrees tasted like they sat too long under the heating lights in that the rueben and burger were both on the dry side. My kid had pancakes, but had to wait even longer because server only brought 2 sets of silverware for 3 people. There is a bar in the front...why?! I disagree with other posters here that the food is very good. It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s not bad, just not anything new (and there are plenty of options within a 3 mile radius of Dundee and Quentin for dinner).

It is very close to my house and I was greatly hoping for a good neighborhood eatery.  The place was gutted and completely redone inside.  I would compare it to a Chipotle style interior. Extremely contemporary all the way down to the glasses and plates. I sat at the bar and ordered a coffee ($2.50) and decided to get the &#34;Grove Ruben&#34; on marble rye with sweet potato waffle fries ($10).  The the whole thing was nothing special.  Fries were good and sandwich was average.  My problem with this place is that it appears they have taken more time worrying about the trendy interior than the actual food, which for the price is definitely not worth it ($16 for coffee and a Reuben after tip). It seems they want to put Inverness/ Barrington prices on a sub par restaurant in Palatine.

Then the excuses started... There were no clean glasses she said. Which was clearly untrue when other tables were getting their drinks. The appetizer (flatbread) came out and was really good, about 5 minutes after the appetizer we received our drinks. The food came out next and my fries were ice cold and my sons Mac and cheese was
2 colors from sitting so long. We complained to who we assumed was the manager (tall blonde woman) she took my sons Mac and cheese and handed me a plate to put my fries on so they could be heated. This was shocking because I would expect new fries not just microwaved food. My sandwich was ok. My husband liked his soup although again the temperature was off. We had to ask other servers for refills. The family at a nearby table waited 45 min never got their drinks and got up and left. Even after complaining we were never offered anything not even an apology. We were however thanked for our feedback. Huge fail!"

First was dinner: Buffalo Chicken Wrap is made with Sriracha, not Buffalo sauce, and the Sriracha is in the ranch, not on the chicken.  Rueben sandwich had extremely tough corned beef, came out of the kitchen cold and soggy and they forgot the swiss! A rueben without swiss?  Kids pizza was over sauced and Kraft Mac n Cheese took the longest our of our 6 meals to come out of the kitchen. Fries were cold, but we did visit on the third day of business, and Tom the owner checked in on us several times.  We chalked this up to  &#39;the first week&#39; and vowed to come back.
Fast forward three weeks and we visited for breakfast.  Eggs were &#39;okay&#39;, not warm when they arrived at our table.  Hash browns tasted &#39;oily&#39; but were cooked to our asking of &#39;crispy&#39;. Overall, their breakfast menu is overpriced for the area.  Coffee is branded as Intelligesta, but at $2.95 for a cup of black coffee, even Starbucks is cheaper! 
We would love to see this restaurant do well, but the prices are a bit high for the area the kitchen could use some more training on the menu and parking lot could benefit from a redesign or expansion. 
Average Price per person: Breakfast $15, Lunch &amp; Dinner $15 without drinks.

Owner Tom, if you are reading this:  the restaurant is too NOISY!  invest in some sound absorbing tiles on the ceiling."

This place is facing an identity crisis; it can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s going to be a bistro or a diner.  As other reviews stated, the service is very hit or miss. Servers forget about the options with each dish (not that it matters because the kitchen will decide for you and by the time the food gets to you).  All three of our entrees tasted like they sat too long under the heating lights in that the rueben and burger were both on the dry side. My kid had pancakes, but had to wait even longer because server only brought 2 sets of silverware for 3 people. There is a bar in the front...why?! I disagree with other posters here that the food is very good. It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s not bad, just not anything new (and there are plenty of options within a 3 mile radius of Dundee and Quentin for dinner). I always try every new restaurant and will keep an eye of the posts here to see if the reviews start trending better before returning."

It is very close to my house and I was greatly hoping for a good neighborhood eatery.  The place was gutted and completely redone inside.  I would compare it to a Chipotle style interior. Extremely contemporary all the way down to the glasses and plates. I sat at the bar and ordered a coffee ($2.50) and decided to get the &#34;Grove Ruben&#34; on marble rye with sweet potato waffle fries ($10).  The the whole thing was nothing special.  Fries were good and sandwich was average.  My problem with this place is that it appears they have taken more time worrying about the trendy interior than the actual food, which for the price is definitely not worth it ($16 for coffee and a Reuben after tip). It seems they want to put Inverness/ Barrington prices on a sub par restaurant in Palatine.  My guess is this place won&#39;t last that long unless they intend on upping the quality of the food or lowering the price of the food."

After being hired as a server and then put behind the bar [I&#39;m not 21] I was given a almost useless job with no tips and 4.00 pay felt great to waste time not making as much as a normal waiter. Lance , one of the owners and head breakfast chef, he was a true leader but it seemed like almost too many times did his employee turn a blind ear towards his directives. Tom the owner forced me to serve 8 times a day to people he would pick up the Bill for and then distract them so they didn&#39;t leave tip or harrass me about how other people did their job wrong so its my fault. Most of the serving staff and hostess staff are very deserving of a job there but some may make for a less than amazing experience. Overall the menu is overpriced from what I know being in the restaurant industry for around 4 years. They have serious issues with ventilation being too hot or too cold. After almost begging for the customers I talked to when they sat at the bar to have a full bar they are now considering it. In all 8 would say if you want a Dennis style restaurant menu with a little more class than go ahead but pray for a good server and a good day for the kitchen workers."

The kids menu is not extensive, but it is interesting. Kids are encouraged to color their menu and then download an app on a phone to make the menu come to life. A good idea while waiting for the food to arrive. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and was disappointed with it since the sauce was made from sriracha and not a tangy Franks hot sauce. The sauce was too hot for me and I couldn&#39;t finish. I did like my tomato basil soup, though. My boys had pancakes (yes, for dinner) and one got the silver dollar pancakes that on the menu said were 5 total but we got way more than that. My other son got one big pancake which was not completely cooked in the middle. My husband got the kale salad and didn&#39;t have complaints. We may give this one more try.

We&#39;re constantly looking for new breakfast places in the area to try and were very excited when we heard about Grove Kitchen.  We went on a Sunday around noon or 1, and I realize this is usually a busy time for breakfast places but the staff seemed completely overwhelmed.  Our waiter wasn&#39;t rude, but wasn&#39;t friendly, either.  Seemed to be counting the minutes until his shift ended.  We brought our 2 yr old with us and were disappointed to find no kids menu.  Food took forever to come and I could smell food burning from the kitchen the entire time we were there. Both my wife&#39;s and my food were cold when they finally arrived.  I had ordered the southwest Benedict and it was basically inedible.  My wife didn&#39;t  particularly enjoy her skillet either.  Our baby had no issues with the fruit plate we ordered for her, but how do you mess up fruit  Didn&#39;t see our waiter again until 30 minutes later when I explained to him the dish I ordered was gross.  Again, didn&#39;t seem to interested.  When the owner/manager (I think) stopped by to ask how it all was, I politely told him, &#34;Actually, not very good.&#34;.  I assume he thought I was joking with him because he just smiled, patted me on the back and walked away.  Either that, or this place is in worse shape than I thought.  I know I wasn&#39;t the only unhappy camper because I saw the same guy make at least 2 or 3 visits to other tables and each time it appeared as though he was handling a complaint of some kind.  Inside of the restaurant was nice, but not enough to bring me back.  Food is horrible and I won&#39;t be surprised if this place is closed within the year.  Very sad, had high hopes."

The wait person never brought bread, told us only one soup was available, but the table next to us got something entirely different, water was not refilled on a timely basis, nor was my soda--in fact the wait person for the table next to us came over when she saw we were being ignored. And forgive me, but we were also charged for ICE (&#39;on the rocks&#39;) when my dining partner had a drink!!!

It takes time--sometimes lots of time.  That said, we called our first order in.  Arrived at the store about 30 minutes later.  

I heard the cashier tell the person in front of me that her order would be ready in about 20 minutes.  Hearing that, I thought, I should be in good shape.  I still had to wait about 10 minutes.  Got the chicken, took it home.

Chicken was delicious and crispy even though it was sitting in a bag for a while.  And, we got a surprise--a good one.  We had ordered two thighs, two drumsticks.  I noticed that the drumsticks were small--but then, instead of two drumsticks I had been given three!  Wow!  I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t happen very often, but lucky me.

The coleslaw was tasty--but we had ordered a medium and were given five little coleslaw cups.  I guess it equaled a medium, so I&#39;m not complaining.

By the way,Harold&#39;s has grape pop in cans.  I love grape pop and can&#39;t find it very often.

Yes, the service is discombulated, the wait is long, and maybe there&#39;s a free-form filling of your order.   However, Harold&#39;s does have the best chicken in the area.  I&#39;ll be back, but I&#39;ll be calling in my order.

In my opinion, the service is horrible. This time, I attempted to call in my order, while driving home. I was put on hold, and left on hold for 12 minutes before hanging up. During the  time I was on hold, I could hear the individual who put me on hold having a conversation with a couple different people. After hanging up, I attempted to call back multiple times, but the line was busy. I arrived at Harold&#39;s about five minutes later. To my surprise, there was only two customers present. I, again, called and let the woman at the counter listen to the busy signal. She asked, &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; I responded that it was the phone at the restaurant. I told her I had been put on hold and left there for 20 minutes. She picked up the cordless, looked at it, then nonchalantly commented, &#34;17 minutes.&#34; I asked her if she was familiar with this restaurant&#39;s service reviews. She responded, &#34;No.&#34; I asked her if she cared. She said, No.&#34; Shocked, I asked, &#34;So you don&#39;t care about having a job?&#34; Before she could respond, I asked asked if the management felt the same way?&#34; She responded, &#34;I make suggestions to the manager and they don&#39;t listen to me, so..&#34; I placed my order, purchasing seven wings. I asked her to wrap the bread separately, paid, then settled in for the typical 20-30 minute wait. To my surprise, my order was ready in about five minutes. When I arrived home a few minutes later, I discovered my toasted bread underneath my rock hard chicken wings. I tried to call the restaurant to complain but there was no answer. I tossed the meal, because it wasn&#39;t fit to eat. 

I have been a Harold&#39;s Fried Chicken customer almost 40 years, and have never experienced anything like described here. Harold&#39;s is known for cooking chicken to order, which obviously was not done in this instance. I must give this restaurant kudos for excellent chicken on my second visit, which was a vast improvement over my first visit. I have never before written a restuarant review, but the horrible attitude of the order taker on duty tonight (Saturday, May 28, 2016 at, 10:25 p.m., was troublesome and motivating. I&#39;ve been an employer for many years -- including being the owner a restaurant. I fired people like this one. I only regret that I don&#39;t have the power to terminate both the cook and clerk in this instance. I won&#39;t be returning to this Harold&#39;s, even though I reside about one minute away. I don&#39;t expect this establishment to remain in busy over the long haul."

I went in and ordered at there counter. The guy told me 20 minutes. I gave them an extra 10 minutes sincere ask the other reviews said they are a bit slow, which they are. You have to remember they makes each order ready to order. I don&#39;t think they use the same coming process as say a popeyes - pressure cooker thingy. 

THE FOOD:
The chicken were tasty in my opinion. Good amount of crispiness still after I got it home. The liver was awesome; better than Brown&#39;s chicken liver, their liver sometimes leaves me with cotton mouth. The okras were good too. They are bite sized version so it&#39;s not a whole okra fried but indivually cut and fried. Overall there food was good in my opinion. 

THE SERVICE:
They can use more people working which is probably why they haver so may order mistakes. They probably need a class in customer service. If they can get that right they will do well in that area. 

I&#39;ll give them another try for consideration."

They told me 10 minutes for Catfish and Dark and it took 20. Some people before me were waiting over 35 minutes. The lady also is not very into her job, more like she could care less about serving me.

Catfish and Dark  is 2 pieces of Catfish a Thigh and Drum. The menu makes it seem like you get 1 piece of catfish and 1 piece of dark.  Menu needs clarification.

Price was 11.99 for Catfish and Dark with fries and bread.

Catfish - pretty good crunch to the crust, decently flavorful crust, good fish flavor but fell apart a bit too easily with a fork. You have to eat it with your hands.

Thigh - juicy crunch chicken but flavor is lacking. I prefer the flavor of Popeyes to this but the crunch is a bit better.

Drum - same deal as the thigh.

Fries - think steak fries but smaller, very powdery, not good at all I threw most of them out.

Bread- not sure why the bread is there, it&#39;s kinda just useless. It&#39;s just a slice of white bread.

Mild sauce - it&#39;s not hot, it&#39;s more of a sweet sauce, decent.

Hot sauce - it&#39;s a vinegar based hot sauce, decently hot but not super hot but the vinegar is something that turns me off greatly."

I got my son the chicken strips meal, it had three chicken fingers and fries for $5. It was an excellent value. The chicken strips were huge and juicy and nicely battered. I&#39;m really glad I tried it for my son. Much better than the Village for a kid because of the freshness and size of the white meat and the  less crunchy batter of the chicken. The fries were just fine, a bit soggy and without any salt. He doesn&#39;t care for fries that much and the chicken filled him up, so in this case it was fine, but I may skip them if I ordered at the store. I also appreciated the excitement the staff had for their chicken and the packaging of my chicken. It was much nicer than the plates everyone else just gives out. Lastly, the chicken does take some time, but I watched it get dropped as I ordered it so it is nice that it&#39;s made to order. 
The chicken was good enough to warrant another try at their store, and per the reviews, I shouldn&#39;t do it in a night I&#39;m in a hurry."

I am no chicken expert, but i dont think even the biggest thigh takes that long to fry. The hot sauce is basically dollar store Louisiana hot sauce. Fries are frozen.  Service is apathetic. If it wasn&#39;t for the coupon i used,  i would never have tried to find it in this ridiculous strip mall it&#39;s in.

  Prediction: this place is out of business in 9-12 months.  

Tell the kid behind the counter to use the belt,  pick up his pants and stop licking his fingers when handing out cups. 

Advice : pay people to run the place that look like care about the customers&#39; time . 

Will never be back.  Hit me up when it&#39;s &#34;permanently closed&#34;."

If you go in knowing that--I think the rest is gravy.  All the food is cooked to order---I&#39;m thinking a bunch of folks have complained and in front of the register there&#39;s now a sign that says expect to wait at least 15 minutes.

Like most, excited to have a Harold&#39;s in my hood.  Called to place my order and the guy taking my order was actually very pleasant.  He told me 25 mins (16 pieces, okra, fries, liver).  I was busy running errands and actually got there 35 mins after---my order wasn&#39;t ready yet, but within 5 minutes everything was packed and I was off.

So mental note--call first and tack on 10-15mins to whatever time they say.  The place is definitely on the small side so looks like more of a take out kind of place as most other locations are, but some seats are available if you want to hangout there a further smell like fried things.  

Liver was excellent, seasoning on not bad either, mild sauce pretty good--a little on the vinegary side.  Okra encapsulated in breading was nothing exciting, fries not that exciting either---but I suppose if you douse in sauce it makes it not so bad.  They&#39;re known for their chicken so really can&#39;t see anything else being that exciting and that&#39;s ok--because there are other places for other food if I want something else.  My service overall was fine, nothing super good and nothing super bad.  I&#39;d go there again--but only if I call to order first."

Like a baby learning how to walk for the first time. I&#39;ve been waiting since last summer for this place to open and I had such high hopes. I think the high expectations so early in their business was harsh. Cost isn&#39;t an issue - sure it&#39;s more expensive than the other Harold&#39;s and similar businesses I&#39;ve frequented, but it&#39;s fair. It costs a lot to have a small business in Schaumburg! You gotta make money somehow. Just pretend you&#39;re buying it from Whole Foods so you&#39;re okay spending more than you think. But the quality of the food, in my own opinion and experience, is worth the price. I noticed reviews have pointed out low quality, but no I am not comparing this to Popeyes. It&#39;s much better. I love that the meat falls off the bone from the wings. My Harold&#39;s order has been the same since I met my husband 9 years ago - extra lemon pepper with mild sauce on the side. They did it just the way I&#39;ve always had it.

And the wait time improved! I had told myself to give them time. My first time, I had waited 45 minutes for a 2 piece. But today I was out in 15 minutes and my catfish &amp; wings combo, with a side of fried okra, and I were on our way home! I had asked for it to go thinking I was gonna be there for a while lol hopefully business stays like this!"

STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!

This place is not the real thing. The service, the food quality and the most important the RECIPE is not the same. It&#39;s basic run-of-the-mill fried chicken place, just double the cost. I&#39;d say it&#39;s a half a notch above a good Popeyes experience except it will run you double and almost triple the price. 

I had the fish combo, tilapia and wings. I didn&#39;t get tilapia and they forgot the wings. What I ended up with was a super salty and fishy catfish meal! Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I grew up on catfish, that&#39;s the only fish my father would fry and it was a special occasion believe it or not, when he was having a good week money-wise he would get is tilapia. I know good catfish and good catfish is something that Harold&#39;s (all the city locations) have proven they can do right, but this suburban imposter is merely that, an imposter with a barely tolerable imitation. 

This is not the real thing folks, this will not give you the real Harold&#39;s experience! It&#39;s like comparing Waukegan to Chicago, yea it can appear to be the same but one cannot truly be compared to the other if you honestly look at the bigger picture.

Anyway. I called and the complained and they said sorry but they couldn&#39;t do anything since 

their policy is: Buy At Your Own Risk

Btw it also took 35 minutes to get the wrong order and the fries are also NOT Harold fries 

I wouldn&#39;t come back"

The space inside is nice, but this particular location is currently plagued by what seems like inexperienced management in addition to the usual opening issues that a new place has.

The menu by the register looks like a photograph of a different location&#39;s menu, blown up. Which, while cheap, would be OK if the menu items and prices were accurate. Unfortunately, they&#39;re not. The least they could do would be to update the pricing on the menu - heck, use a sharpie guys!

We ordered some chicken tenders, a mixed 4-piece with mild sauce, an order of fries and some fried okra. The chicken is all served on a handful of fries, on top of a piece of white bread. This does a good job of keeping the chicken crispy, but renders those fries inedible.

All of the food suffered from a lack of seasoning, the fries and okra were a little underdone, and most of the chicken was overcooked and dry. There were a few pieces, however, that were cooked better than the rest and those were delicious. The sauces (hot &amp; mild) are really a must have here, make sure to get one either on the chicken or on the side. The wings with sauce were the best thing on the plate.

I&#39;m hoping that the owner/management will correct some of these issues and I look forward to giving the place another shot. It could be a great chicken place for the Schaumburg / Hoffman Estates area."

Called my order in ahead of time, one 6 piece and one 4 piece. They told me 20 min but when I arrived I waited about another 15 or 20 min. The girl on the reigster wasn&#39;t too bad...just seemed uninterested in her job or the customers. Chicken was ok, not enough sauce, coleslaw was a &#34;NO&#34;, &amp; I&#39;ve had better fries out of the oven.

2nd time I went was HORRIBLE. Called my order in again, this time 18 wings and the girl on the phone asked when I&#39;d like to pick it up - I said 30 min. Now, most people with common sense would politely tell you if your order would take longer due to orders ahead of yours - this didn&#39;t happen. I got there 30 min later and waited in line for almost 10 min with 1 person waiting in line before me (he just walked out). So the funky attitude lady behind the counter asked me....wait she didn&#39;t ask me anything just had this ridiculous look on her face. I gave her my name and told her I was there to pickup my order I called in...this chick just walked away behind a curtain! Ummm hello? Did you not just hear me speak?? 

The place was full of people sitting or standing around with no food but pissed off looks on there faces. One lady who eventually got her order left only to come back 2 min later because her order was wrong. After waiting another 15 min I just left...needless to say no one ever told me anything about my order.

I don&#39;t know what kind of tom foolery is going on up in this place, but the excuse that you just opened is not acceptable. The long wait times for chicken are bad (you&#39;d think I was ordering duck), but the pissy attitudes and unprofessional of your &#34;front of the house staff&#34; is disgusting.

Definitely not the Harold&#39;s I grew up on and know. Been to all of the locations and they are ALL exceedingly above this one. Believe the other negative reviews because they&#39;re true. Seems like this is someone in the restaurant business that clearly shouldn&#39;t be. I will not be back...can fry my own chicken quicker and serve myself with a smile.

I wish I had read the reviews before I patronized this Harold&#39;s. The photos of the food doesnt even look good. I was excited to finally have a Harold&#39;s close to my home so I don&#39;t have to drive to the city. I placed my order online and I thought it was pretty easy and simple. The online site sent me a confirmation stating that my order will be ready in 20 minutes. I got there in thirty minutes and told the cashier that I&#39;m there to pick up my online order. She walked directly to the cooking area without saying anything to me and came back with the cook (im assuming that&#39;s who he was) He was polite and told me that  and they stated that they did not receive the order and that they will have it ready shortly. I did notice that he didn&#39;t say how long but I assumed it will take 15 minutes. I 

When I walked through the door I did notice that there were 7-8 individuals just sitting around. No one was eating something told me not to place my order when the man told me they never received my order. 

I came back 20 minutes later and the same individuals were still waiting. 10 minutes later 2 people canceled there order. One lady was waiting over 35 mins and one man had to get back to work. So he basically missed his lunch hour. 

The food

I order two chicken orders and a small order of gizzards.

The sauce does not taste like Harold&#39;s original sauce it has more of a ketchup flavor. 

The gizzards were fired soft and some of them were not fully coated. The ones that I ate were not seasoned. When I bit into one that did not feel full cooked and eating one gizzard that tasted more like a piece of liver. I was done!!!

The chicken was fried soft so there was barely any crunch to the chicken. The flavor is okay since I don&#39;t like to much seasoning on my food. The fries were barely done.

Needless to say I will not be going back."
harolds-chicken-schaumburg-6,Satyam C.,1sKNE1YABjc7aViN0hJI4Q,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,1,0,4,48,SSC3QfVWIZY4LUTT6Rbz8A,2.0,2016-02-17,"Writing this review immediately after eating a 4 piece. I had very high hopes for this place. I have been to three other locations that I can recall. 

This one is located in the same strip mall as Fox and Hound and right next to Richard walkers. Is this place just opened two weeks ago, it was extremely clean on the inside. The first thing that I noticed was that there was no bulletproof glass. If anyone has been to the other locations, you know what I mean. It is a large location with approximately 6 to 7 tables and a barstool area where you can eat. Did I mention how clean this place was?

I began to order my food and decided to go with the four piece so I can try each part of the chicken. I also asked for mild sauce on the half of it and hot sauce on the other half. The mild sauce is not as good as the other Harold&#39;s locations. It is far inferior to uncle Remus as well. The hot sauce on the other hand is great. Get the hot sauce. 

This place is definitely the black sheep of the neighborhood. Located in an upscale area, Harold&#39;s just does not fit it in. However I was super excited to see up there as I have not been to one due to the extreme locations of the others. This was supposed to be my savior. The crowd there is mixed. Black folks white folks yellow folks brown folk. Everything. While waiting for my food I noticed many people asking questions. Unfortunately the staff there is not trained properly yet.

The chicken: 

The breast had no bone in it. This confused me a bit. But I am glad to eat a piece of chicken with no bone in it. Unfortunately this breast was ridiculously dry. It was a struggle to even tear it apart. Not good. Through away 70% of it.

The leg was extremely crispy and flavorful. I generally hate the leg but this was tolerable.

The thigh. Generally my favorite piece of chicken. Unfortunately it was dry chewy and rubbery and lacked flavor. Not happy. I expect my thighs to be juicy.

The wing. This was by far the best piece of chicken. Let this be a lesson. Everyone should just stick with the wings. With hot sauce. That will definitely be my next meal there.

Overall the chicken was lacking something major that the other locations do great with. At each location I&#39;ve been to besides this one, you can see the seasoning in the chicken. On the meat. In the meat. All over. At this particular location i did not see ANY. This was greatly disappointing because I enjoy that thoroughly. Hopefully as time goes on they will figure this out.

The fries and bread were soggy but I do not think they were meant to be eaten.

The menu board price and the price is on the table are drastically different. So is the phone number. There is a sign on a piece of paper that says cash only. Hopefully that will change as well.

Yes. I will go again and give it a chance redeem itself. Perhaps I screwed up by forgetting my Mystic."

We ordered the 24 piece chicken with extra sauce and 8 piece mixed chicken and a side of fries. We called ahead and they told us the food would be ready in about 20-30 minutes but it was longer, probably closer to 45 minutes although there were other people there with about the same size order we had. They had space for dine in but it seemed that most people did carryout. The chicken was light, fell off the bone and flavorful, not greasy like Hooters. We enjoyed the food even though we didn&#39;t have the signature piece of bread with our order. 

My tips are:
Call ahead. You can find the menu online.
Bring cash... It&#39;s a cash only shop although they use an iPad so a simple attachment could change that.
Expect to wait about 15 minutes more than told."

Fried chicken is made to order hot, crunchy, n juicy inside, not sitting under a heat lamp drying out for the last 1/2 hour.  Thing I hate about Schaumburg is it&#39;s patrons... (maybe populated with aging folks or just flat out broke) ..quit being so cheap, diversify, open your palettes and support your local restaurants and keep this one going.

I finally got my food and was home in a few minutes.  I opened up my bag to see that they didn&#39;t include either of the hot sauces I was supposed to get.  The chicken pieces were small and mildly tasty.  The perch had a good flavor to it. The fries were average at best.

So essentially I paid a fairly high price and waited 45 minutes for average food, without everything I ordered, and with no one thanking me for coming, apologizing for the wait or even smiling.  None of that makes me want to come back..."

She asked them if they had opened a location in the suburbs and they asked her what was she talking about? She told them a location in Schaumburg opened up and that they were using their name or something very similar to their name. They told her that they are going to check into it. Looks like an imposter trying to profit off of Harold&#39;s Chicken Schack&#39;s name. So beware...

Tried eating there about 3 weeks ago. Went on a Friday night around 8:30 PM. Place was full of customers waiting for their orders. 

I waited for about 15 minutes to place my order but no one seemed to want to fill it. For the most part nobody was working the register. Once a girl came out to take a couple orders ahead of me then disappeared behind a curtain I can only assume to go in the kitchen to help with the food. She came out another time to give a person their order but then quickly disappeared behind the curtain. After 15 minutes of this I left and went to KFC down the street. 

From the Yelp reviews I guess I made the right decision. Who knows when I would have been given my order if I was able to place one as there were about 30 people standing around with receipts in their hands and no food coming out of the kitchen. I won&#39;t be back unless the reviews improve on Yelp. I had high hopes for this place and hope they figure it out soon. If not they probably won&#39;t last in Schaumburg."

Was extremely disappointed, the food is just okay but what makes me not want to come here is the service and the price. For mediocre chicken and terrible service the price should be substantially lower. They charge for tap water out of the soda machine, which alone is ridiculous. Popeyes alone is 10x better then this place when it comes to the price and service. Wouldn&#39;t recommend unless things change."

I scrounged Yelp reviews to see what the deal was and I don&#39;t think they do the place justice. I used to live in the city and the food here was exactly the same as the location I used to frequent in Rogers Park. Honestly the most important thing to me is that the chicken is crispy,  good quality, and fresh- and this met those standards. Plus- it&#39;s made to order which is the reason for the longer wait times. If you&#39;ve ever made fried chicken you know you can&#39;t do it right in less than 15 minutes so I would just prepare yourself for that. Plus their hot sauce is to die for- a little hot, a little sweet, mostly tangy, delicious! Not huge on their fries but that&#39;s not why I come. I&#39;ve tried calling a few times when they should be open and gotten no answer (after A LOT of tries) but when I&#39;ve gone in and gotten through the staff has been very nice. I recommend giving it a try and forming your own opinion over reading most reviews- it&#39;s not for everyone but it&#39;s not as bad as a lot of people are saying in their reviews!"

I had the WORST experience. like most of the other people commenting here, I had high hopes for this place. It&#39;s not a surprise to hear that it is just an imposter of the other Harold&#39;s Chicken (which I have not been to yet). I guess I will just have to make the drive to get the REAL experience.

I walked into this location with my cousin. We were reading off the menu and were surrounded by 10-12 people waiting for their orders to be ready...after the women began to ring our order-the credit card machine went down and the women yelled, &#34;cash only.&#34; We didn&#39;t have cash so we just left."

Placed a to go order at the counter and waited about 25 min (no worries - I expected that to get their custom fresh orders).  When I received my order I noticed the sauce and the coleslaw were missing.  I was given a  small cup of slaw and told it was the large $1.80. (measured at home it is just under 1/2 cup) I asked are you sure - he said yes there are more lil ones inside each order (there wern&#39;t).  I drove home to find my order completely incorrect. So drove back to wait more for him to find order, had to ask him to please start my order over to speed it up.  I got 8 piece white chicken only , a 7 piece wing with fries (Forgot the bread too), and one large slaw it was $32 and some change and he said he had no change to give from 35 so I said - just add it to the tip jar.  90 minutes later I feel like I was ripped off more than once.

I called in a order yesterday after work. I was given a time of twenty minutes for pickup. It takes me about an hour to get to this location from my place of employment. I purposely took a chance and ordered waaaay ahead of time just to see if their response time would be better than a few days ago when we first tried them out. Not only was the order not ready in had to wait an additional 30 minutes for my order. This is ridiculous for a total of eight chicken wings. Even if the order doesn&#39;t drop until you arrive this wait time is ridiculous. There was not a wait when I arrived so I do not understand this wait time. I really want this business to succeed because it will keep me from having to travel to the Southside of Chicago for another Harold&#39;s location, a REAL Harold&#39;s location, but things aren&#39;t looking too promising."

Actually got in the car and drove here and was still on hold when we got there to find only two people waiting! When we informed the girl that we have been on hold all this time all she could say was that she just got there so it wasn&#39;t her who put us on hold. No I&#39;m sorry or anything. Once we asked to speak to a manager we were told that no one was there and that we can come back tomorrow to talk to someone. Why am I going to take time out of my day to drive back up there to talk to someone? Just give me a name so I can call and talk to someone. I had to tell them I could just call the BBB or she could go back there and find someone for me to talk to. The head cook finally came out to talk to me but no one seemed genuine about their apology. I finally got a name of a manager they said I could call the next day but when I called the next day I was told that the manager was not there and not coming in. Supposedly I spoke with the owner who didn&#39;t seem to know his workers names and when they work!! In the end I was offered a 10% discount on my next order. Does that even cover taxes?! They need better customer service. Hopefully they will get better.

Since being opened about 2 or 3 weeks ago, I have attempted to eat her several times.  The first time I was greeted by the &#34;Cash Only&#34; sign, so I turned away.  That sign is now gone, so they apparently take credit cards.  Several other times I have attempted to go, to be greeted by &#34;Closed for Routine Maintenance - Open again at Noon.&#34;  The couple of times I saw this sign, it was after Noon.  Once, after seeing this sign, I went back again at dinner time, and the sign changed to &#34;Closed to due System Upgrade.&#34;   I went last night, armed with cash (just in case), they were open, but after waiting in line to order, I was told they were out of certain pieces of chicken, so I could not order what I wanted.  Okay, I decided to change my order, but then they were out of coleslaw.  While I was waiting, several patrons were asking where there orders were, and when they got their orders they were wrong.  So, I decided to go somewhere else.  Based upon the two reviews about the food, I probably will pass."

I called my order in and was told 25 minutes. I came in on time and paid for my order. The cashier did not tell me how long it would be but I figured another 5-10 minutes is not unreasonable.  50 minutes after I called I asked if they can check in on my order. The lady took my ticket back to the kitchen and said it would be another ten minutes. 70 minutes in, a man comes out calling out my number but he had no chicken for me. He just wanted to see if I was still waiting since he knows I&#39;ve been waiting for a while. I told him how long I&#39;ve been waiting and he responded by telling me that my chicken is cooking right now because they just found my ticket. So obviously the lady that checked in on my order lied.  It was another 20 minutes before my order came out, 1 hour and 30 minutes from when I called it in. I was not the only one experiencing this kind of service. The place was crowded and they were obviously overwhelmed but this whole time they kept telling new customers their order would take 20-25 minutes. Based on people&#39;s overall demeanor, I suspect others with larger orders waited longer than I did. Multiple people walked out saying &#34;last time I come to this place&#34;. One guy left knowing he only got part of his order. This place cannot last but every day it stays open is a crime."

So while in the area I jumped on the opportunity to check them out. We came in for lunch &amp; dined on the lunch menu. We had 10 pc garlic buffalo &amp; 10pc BBQ &amp; an order of fries. 

Since it was a nice day we sat outside. We enjoyed breeze. No bugs!!! Yayyyyy. The waitress was cool &amp; attentive. It took the wings about 15mins. The garlic is VERY garlicky, but pretty good. Didn&#39;t taste the BBQ but hubs said it was good. The fries are expensive $5.00. They&#39;re good, but not that good!!!! 

I definitely wanna come back to try other flavors. Also try out the drinks/drink specials. I like that they stay open til 4am too."

Seriously though, this is a great study of capitalism. How much can they raise prices to maximize profit without making their product undesirable and the demand decrease? 

My last carry out visit Saturday tipped my wallet at $26 for 20 garlic wings (2 orders.) If you want celery with your wings, an order costs $2.49. They haven&#39;t included celery with their wings forever but it just stings a little bit more when they continue to raise prices but won&#39;t include 5 sticks of celery.

Here&#39;s what is making me cry &#39;fowl&#39; since I knew all this before picking up my wings. The drummettes were smaller than usual. The flats were much bigger than the drummettes. This resulted in perfectly juicy flats and overcooked, dried out drummettes. Also, they went easy on the coated sauce again, despite mentioning that my previous order was light on sauce and having the bartender verbally ensure that it wouldn&#39;t be a problem this time. Last but not least, I requested blue cheese but received ranch. 

The wings definitely suffer when you carry out since they virtually steam in the styrofoam container in transit. Dine in for the best quality straight from the fryer when they&#39;re freshly tossed with sauce. They win 1st place at Chicago Wingfest almost every year. I&#39;ve been to Chicago Wingfest ten times, Milwaukee Wingfest twice and have to agree. Their Garlic Buffalo Wings are my favorite ever and when they&#39;re fresh, they are FRESH!

They have a buffet in the bar on Friday late afternoon that&#39;s free with two drink minimum. They now bottle their sauce and it costs $5.50/bottle at the restaurant. Heinens grocery store also carries their bottled sauce and it&#39;s cheaper at Heinens. Say whaaaaa?"

Tasty buffalo garlic wings, nicely sized, and definitely easy to wash down with those daily drink specials.  The night I went the Revolution IPA pours were only $3.  Late night hours are a plus too!! (After all, not much to choose from in Palatine or nearby area). 

Waffle fries are a must add.  Perfect to pair with all that greasy, garlicky fried goodness!  Friendly service and aside from a bit of a tummy ache the next day, I wound up coming back here for even more!!  What can I say, I&#39;m a glutton for that garlicky fried goodness..!!"

I work right by gators so I figure I would pick up n go home. When I get home I see there was no cheddar or bacon on my fries!!i live 40 mins away so I couldn&#39;t return.

  I call because I got upset and the owner was very sweet and apologized. He said he would send me a gift card to make up for it so that was very nice. My plain fries are still good! And the wing are sooooo delicious and big!
  It looks very fun to dine in. Place is bigger than what it looks on the outside. Parking looks a little tight. Inside they had a bar section and plenty tables. Their was also an outdoor area but I think it&#39;s closed due to the winter season. 
  I will return to gators once I get my gift card in the mail. I heard they are known to have a lot of Blackhawks fans go! So that&#39;s a plus because me and my boyfriend love the Hawks."

We where seated right away but after 10 minutes of staff walking passed us and not one person providing any service not even waters.  We left never to return.  Informed staff of our departure the manager or any staff members did not say a word.  So I have to assume this is a normal process at this establishment.  The only menu note I can make is that they charge $2.99 for a fountain soda and with there lack of attention to there customers I doubt you would ever get a refill.

Heck yeah! Not like we usually go that late but on the days when my boyfriend and I want to hangout but not stay home, this is one of our go to places because it&#39;s a short walk away. 

Gators is a really casual place that sometimes feels borderline dive bar and borderline where you go after school with your friends for wings. There is a bar side and dining side, you do have to be 21 to come in once it gets later, and there is also a patio that has a bunch of seating. I&#39;ll admit, I don&#39;t like the checked plasticky table clothes they have, those always feel dirty to me, but they do seem to clean their tables so it&#39;s just me. The bar has plenty of seating, TVs, darts, and other games including pinball (yeah buddy).

The wings are pretty good here. While they do cost about $1 or so a wing, they are HUGE! It&#39;s not like when you go to many places and get this tiny little thing that looks like it came out of a the Caputos frozen aisle, here you actually get a meaty bone (or nugget for you heathen boneless eaters) not to mention the wide variety of flavors you can choose from. IMPORTANT TO KNOW: there are ALWAYS coupons on their website that can give you some great savings on your bill! Print them out! Drink specials: ask for them! They always have $4 long islands and daily specials (see picture). 

I&#39;ve had nothing but good experiences with the staff, they seem nice. As can be expected, if you come in late, you are going to encounter a lots of drunks so keep your women close, men!"

We&#39;ve seen this place a few times and always said we&#39;d try it and today we did. We carried out the buffalo garlic and jalapeño buffalo wings. It came out to $25 but I had a coupon so I paid $23. Pretty expensive for wings but we&#39;re in the suburbs so it&#39;s to be expected. Overall the wings are huge and pretty tasty.

The slab of ribs.... Not the best, was a bit disappointed. The meat was dry. The flavor was great but the meat was just to dry. Maybe i just had the bad one idk i would have to give the benefit of the doubt.

I first stumbled upon Gators wings at the Chicago Wingfest and immediately knew we had something special right there. How could a wing joint from Palatine beat the best of the best from the city? One word: Garlic! It&#39;s not even a complicated concept at all...take your classic buffalo wing and toss a shit ton of garlic in it and boom you got yourself a winner. They just execute it so well and it&#39;s consistently delicious.

After that first Chicago Wingfest we went to, we definitely had to check out the actual location. 

Ambiance: From the outside Gators looks like just a small neighborhood restaurant/bar off Rand Rd. When you walk in you have a bar on one side and a bunch of tables and booths on the other. The atmosphere is pretty divey, with just plain tables and chairs similiar to what you might set up in your basement for a house party. All that didn&#39;t matter though. The only piece of decor you needed to see are the trophies they take home year after year at the Wingfest. 

Food: It&#39;s all about the wings when I come to Gators. Garlic buffalo is hands down my go to flavor, but I&#39;ve tried most of them over the years. Not only is the sauce fantastic, but these are some of the meatiest wings I&#39;ve ever had. These chickens must be on roids haha. They serve full jumbo wings with the tips, and overall these wings make b-dubs and even Hooter&#39;s wings look tiny. 

They have a bunch of combinations of sauces. There are 3 different base flavors: buffalo, BBQ, and teriyaki.

Then on top of that there are 3 variations of each of these base sauces:

Garlic - Self explanatory. Add garlic to the sauce...but in insane quantities that will make your breath smell glorious. 

Jalapeño - Again, pretty self explanatory. Throw some jalapeños in the sauce to add a little heat.

Mexican - This is the next spice level up from just jalapeño. In addition to jalapeños they throw a bunch of other spicy elements like crushed red pepper. It&#39;s a tasty type of burn. 

My two favorite flavors are easily the garlic buffalo and the Mexican hot BBQ.

The fries are actually pretty legit here too. I would definitely upgrade to the waffle fries and throw some cajun seasoning on it. You won&#39;t regret it. If you order one of the sauced fries like garlic buffalo fries though, be warned that they definitely don&#39;t skimp on the sauce. The fries are drowned in it and even a flavor as amazing as garlic buffalo can get tiring if everything is covered in it. There&#39;s usually plenty of leftover sauce at the bottom of each bowl of wings, so my strategy is just to get regular fries and use the leftover sauce puddles for dipping. 

Random tidbits about Gators:
-They have a killer lunch deal: $7.99 for 10 jumbo wings. It&#39;s 10 min from my work and a dangerously convenient lunch option.
-They have a printable 20% coupon on their website that always comes in handy.
-Sometimes on Friday nights they have this magician walking around to the tables doing different magic tricks. His bit always ends with a creepy clapping monkey.
-They&#39;re not open for lunch on Saturdays. I learned this the hard way.
-On Friday afternoons, they have a free buffet when you buy a drink. They bring out different types of pizza and wings, but people empty out the trays within seconds of it hitting the table. You never really know what type of wing or pizza they&#39;re bringing out at any given time. I&#39;d rather just pay for my wings and not have to deal with the stress of gettin your fill. Not a bad option though if you just wanna chill and you&#39;re not too worried about maxin&#39; out on wings."

The wrap was extremely messy, oozing of buffalo sauce. Tears of enjoy from the jalapeño/buffalo combo. This wrap is hottt!!! The side salad, well is salad. It was good but way too many tomatoes compared to greens and the waiter brought me the wrong dressing.. but all forgiven ha, I used the wrong dressing and enjoyed the salad! 

My friend got the terkayi boneless wings, he&#39;s not from the area. He loved the wings. He also skipped the fries and ordered celery. Which is good with the Bleu cheese dressing!

Secondly, it has plastic plaid tablecloths...love those!  Lastly, it has some of the best wings I&#39;ve ever had. 

Why do stupid people go to BWW when this place is around?  Seriously, the wings here are large, meaty and delicious.  I think BWW gets their wings from scrawny, baby chickens and that is just icky and sad.

Here,  I like the lemon pepper flavor and garlic.  Their buffalo version is good too and if you are a wing purist, you can get them simply fried.  Their menu is large and varied.  If you don&#39;t feeling like being fat ass, you can get some pretty healthy grilled chicken salads and they have lots of low carb options too.

If you&#39;ve got your fattie going on, they have a bunch of French fries options (garlic, parmesan, cheese, etc.) and some pretty good burgers too.  They also have skirt steak a bunch of different ways that would put any Mexican eatery to shame.  Never had the pizza.

The wings are the best here. They are big wings and they also serve the boneless variety too, but I like them with the bones. I like to work on eating my food. I tried the Teriyaki Jalapeno sauce but it was not spicy at all. The Mexican Hot Buffalo sauce was just a tad spicy too. The Honey Mustard sauce is the same as their salad dressings so it was tasty. 

I wouldn&#39;t recommend the Buffalo Chicken pizza because it was too small about 8 inches and thin so not very filling. My husband shared my lunch as a result. 

I like that they offer their salads already chopped so it soaks up more of the dressings and they have a large selection of salads to choose from. 

They do refill pop and iced tea so this is nice after all the wings. I would definitely come back if I was in the neighborhood."
