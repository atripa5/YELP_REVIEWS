frankys-st-charles,Johnny A.,l0_9uO9HSlhuMuMI95VASg,6ZXo-JLsXw3ehIKRkmR2Xg,"Updating my review to 4 stars, after family and I have been here a few recent times and have had some really great food.  We must also mention again this place is VERY REASONABLY PRICED (compared to Portillo&#39;s, Rosati&#39;s, especially Scooby&#39;s,)

** THIS IS ALSO THE KINDA PLACE WHERE THERE IS SO MUCH FOOD TO TRY, that even if you got something the first time around and maybe didn&#39;t like it - TRY THEM AGAIN with a different item!.

- Italian Beef - excellent (not too wet, but not dry.  Some places drench the beefs which some people like, I don&#39;t.)  Great spices, too.

- Fries - very good, and not too salty (in comparison, Portillo&#39;s drenches their fries in salt).

- Gyros - excellent.

- Foot long Polish - VERY GOOD!  Reasonably priced with fries!

- Friday Shrimp special - very good.  Also comes with a drink and two pieces of garlic bread for roughly $8.00.  VERY REASONABLE.

- The staff was very friendly to us when we were inside.

We will be returning, as there is a lot more stuff we plan to try.",22/07/16,122,4,2,5,20,4.4886,3.6570000000000005,0.044,10.299,No,1034

frankys-st-charles,Scott M.,js2Jy7YMFNCyhJhGoV4Rcg,2-GuSVh5T7KXmR48SNK_jQ,"Hot dog joints in Chicago are sometimes a chore to review, for most Chicagoans are somewhat sentimental about their Local faves, and everyone else seems to be a wretched interloper and pretender to the Crown. Take, for instance, the mass delusion that Gene &amp; Judes (or worse still, Superdawg) is superior to the greatest restaurant in the Western Hemisphere, HENRY&#39;S HOT DOGS (&#34;a meal in a bun&#34;) on Ogden Avenue in Cicero, Il.
But I digress.
Franky&#39;s is a re-purposed &#34;Dog N Suds&#34;. As a youth, I LOVED &#34;Dog N Suds&#34;. There was a period about 15 years ago, they started to appear again. I won&#39;t say I bought my house (The esteemed and Stately Breakwind Manor) on the basis of a nearby NEW Dog N Suds, but such a condition did not hurt the decision. 
The oddity is, I never liked the food, nor the Root Beer, at Dog N Suds. Maybe it was the &#34;drive in&#34; aspect, and the squawk-box communicators that held me in thrall. Dunno. For the record, the adjacent DNS closed up shop shortly after we moved in, and after a few shite meals, the novelty of the drive in wore off anyway. 
Which brings me around to Franky&#39;s.
It ain&#39;t no &#34;Dog N Suds&#34; no more. The Parking lot squawkers are gone, replaced by a garden-variety drive-through window. A rather massive menu greets you as you round the rear of the building.
As I was forced with &#34;Dinner-In-The-Car&#34; that day, I switched to my requisite order: A Plain Hotdog, and a plain Italian Sausage on a hot dog bun.
What sort of against-the-grain fuckery is that kind of order, you may very well ask?
Easy-it is nigh impossible to eat a full-regalia Chicago Hot Dog while at the wheel. Well, you can, if you want to wear the whole mishegoss on the front of your shirt. Same with the Salsicc&#39;. On a Turano Roll, with Beef gravy, Sweet Peppers and Hot giardinara, you have various disjecta membra, all with multiple staining potential (plus the flaky flaky crumbs from the crisp Italian Baguette) ready, willing and able to permanently soil your togs, and insure your meeting someone quite influential shortly after it occurs.
A Plain Hotdog in a hotdog bun, can be eaten in the wrapper with close to total confidence. Nothing is going to shoot out of your sandwich reminding you of a porn stars ultimate issue, only to leave a tell-tale trail on your shirt, or even more dismal, your tie. A self-contained weenie is easy to manage.
The masterstoke here is the Italian Sausage on the hot dog bun. In Chicago, the bun is invariably steamed, so it conforms to the sausage&#39;s shape. No peppers, no juice, no nothin&#39;. Meat and Bread. Again, easy to manage and perfect for an on-the go feed.
The downside here, is you taste the meat, and little else. As the Chicago Hot Dog bun is only a method of culinary delivery, it&#39;s taste potential is practically inert. If there ain&#39;t nothin&#39; goin&#39; on in the middle of those buns, then you might as well have stopped at Staples and picked up a bag of Styrofoam packing pellets to munch on.
But if the meat is happenin&#39; you&#39;ve got a meal. So much emphasis is place on the toppings, one can lose sight of how tasty a good Chicago Frankfurter Sausage is. I said a good one. It has to be at least Vienna. And that&#39;s putting the low end pretty high. If you can find a Kosher dog, so much the better. I used to like David Berg. but Kosher Zion are fab. Jerk-off cost cutters get pale, insipid tubes of bland ecch-meat that would even be improved by ketchup, which, as even second-graders in Chicago know, is a basic crime against humanity. A solo good-quality frank in a bun has a simple elegance that one can appreciate.
The hazard increases for the Italian Sausage. Get a mushy or off-spiced one and it will make you sorry you didn&#39;t stop at McDonalds. But get a good one, where, in an inert frame as it is in a hot-dog bun, and the flavor will jump out and you will not miss all the usual accoutrements. 
In both cases, here Franky&#39;s hit the note. A fine quality Frank, and a succulent, spicy Sausage. They threw in a large portion of fresh-cut fries that needed more salt than I had on hand (I was driving, give me a break), but they were also of fine quality. 
This joint is nowhere in my neighborhood, but I have, on occasion, a need to traverse the route that takes me past Franky&#39;s front door. Next time, I will plan on enough schedule to stop inside and try this stuff in full mufti. I&#39;m expecting a fine feed.",15/05/16,569,3,1,5,-96,7.399400000000002,6.590999999999999,2.165,42.245,No,4504

frankys-st-charles,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,nNbFkqkF4aY91SUiz8TSjg,"Not too long ago a friend of mine notified me that a new hot dog place had opened up on his commute to and from work while going through St. Charles. This weekend we finally had the opportunity to visit this new hot dog place and once I stepped inside it immediately looked rather familiar. The sign on the place said Franky&#39;s and I soon realized I had been to a very similar looking establishment in Addison some time earlier. After a quick look at the menu it was clear that these two places were related. This Franky&#39;s is a bit different than the Addison location in that they have a drive-thru. 

I placed an order for a hot dog, and since I was particularly hungry something called a Pizza burger. For a place with a drive-thru this was a long wait (nearly twenty minutes) and when my food was finally out I was rather hungry. I made my way over to the soda fountain, poured myself some water. Snapped a few pictures and it was time to dig in.

The first thing I tried was the hot dog. The hot dog here was on top of some fries, the fries were greasy and bland. They weren&#39;t too salty, and had some soft potato paste inside. They just didn&#39;t have much taste to them at all, I had a few and then went for the hot dog.

The hot dog was rather sloppily prepared. The back side of the bun had become detached, so the top and the bottom of the hot dog were disconnected causing it to slide around when eating. Immediately noticeable to me was fact that the pickle here was slightly larger than the dog itself. I took my first bite and immediately tasted a pickle sandwich. After removing the pickle from the hot dog, the situation improved quite a bit and this would have passed for an above average hot dog most places in terms of taste. But with the back having fallen out it was still difficult to eat. The sausage used here was skinless, the usual mustard, onion and relish were well applied but the tomato slices were also thick and uneven. There was no sport pepper or celery salt on this hot dog.

Next it was time to try the Pizza Burger. I&#39;ve had pizza burgers at other places in the past with pretty good results. Unfortunately this pizza burger was not a pretty good result. I wouldn&#39;t say it was bad, I would say it was average. The bun was nice and soft and the beef was good. The pizza sauce they used was bland and tasted more like crushed tomato than pizza sauce. If I had to compare the sauce on this pizza burger to real pizza in terms of flavor, this was generic frozen pizza sauce having been unfrozen.

Overall the hot dog here despite being sloppily made actually tasted pretty good with the gargantuan pickle removed. I think from this visit this Franky&#39;s is a bit worse than the Addison location. They also sport the tag line &#34;Frankly the Best&#34;, my reply to that is &#34;Frankly you&#39;re nothing special&#34; which is why I&#39;m giving them three stars. If you have a lot of patience to wait for average quality food then this is the place to go. It&#39;s clean inside, not bad and not great.",18/03/14,332,3,1,3,-34,2.0809999999999995,2.5780000000000003,2.099,28.323999999999998,No,3055

It has been a long time since I saw a drive thru menu that big and expressive. 10 inch this, 8 inch that, extra this, extra that. Very impressive. But could they do the same for my taste buds?

I put them to the test and ordered the 8 inch Italian beef with sweet peppers, fries, and a medium drink. Nice guy at the window too; not only nice but he looked like he was just starting his shift; immaculate.

I didn&#39;t wait long and was rewarded with a giant white bag. Hm mm, more intrigue. I must admit the fries were mild and crunchy; not limp. But the real find was the Italian beef. Not only was it huge, but the flavor was pro Italian all the way. A spicy beef topped with marinated sweet peppers that were wonderful. I also give them extra credit for serving me nice hot food at a nice late hour; something I expect.

frankys-st-charles,Rob Z.,cITGHVu2y_Gya4JV7ATjLg,gD4OHc3sdvQ8BijHsZUFsw,"Finally checked this place out, expecting it to be a typical dogs and beef sandwich place and noticed they have a very large menu (that&#39;s a good thing, since I have three kids).  I&#39;ve often lamented the lack of good BBQ in these parts and opted for the half slab of ribs meal.  Comes with fries, garlic bread and slaw, all for $9.  They told me when I ordered that it would be a 8-10 min wait for ribs.  Seemed worth it.  

The ribs were outstanding, and reminded me a lot of Portillo&#39;s Ribs, in terms of look, feel and even taste.  Their sauce is similar to the Portillo&#39;s sauce, but I liked it a bit more.  Tangy and spicy.  Meat fell off the bone and was very tasty.  The fries were standard fare.  The meal came with a 6&#34; loaf of garlic bread and was a nice addition to the meal, albeit filling.  Overall, I thought it was a pretty good pile of food for $9, to be honest, and they offer the same meal for $8.50 on Saturday.  

I noticed they have pasta and pizza options on the menu, and I&#39;ll return to check that out with my boys.  The place was bustling with customers over lunch today, and the drive through was busy, too.

My criticism would just be the boring fries and the fact that when I asked for an add&#39;l side of BBQ sauce, I had to pay 50 cents for it.  I think of sauce as a condiment, like mustard or ketchup, and it bugs me to have to pay extra for it.  I realize it costs them, but it&#39;s something no other place has ever charged me for.  It&#39;s not that I can&#39;t afford it.  It&#39;s just the principle that bugs me.  

Overall, I will come back for the ribs, since they strike me as the best there is to be found around here (faint praise, considering what&#39;s around here, but they were really good).  I will also drag the whole family here soon.  Would have honestly rated this a 3.5 stars, but forced to choose 3 or 4, I opted for 3 based on the fries and paying for the extra ounce of BBQ sauce.",19/03/14,225,3,2,3,15,2.2619999999999996,2.138,1.116,18.744999999999997,No,1958

I visited Franky&#39;s before and thought the food was pretty good so I decided to go back. Last time I ordered an eggplant parmesan sandwich and asked for the sauce on the side since I wasn&#39;t going to eat it right away. The guy that took my order in the drive-thru asked if I would like everything wrapped separately and he packed up the bread, eggplant, sauce, and cheese separately... It was fabulous! Today I decided to ask for the same thing only to be met with the manager/partial owner at the drive-thru window explaining to me that it was &#34;not their policy&#34; to do this and whoever had help me previously should not have done this. Now I could understand if I was asking for this during a busy rush but I was there at 9:30 at night with one other car in the drive-thru and i would have happily pulled to the side to wait for my order. And honestly how much time does it really take to not melt cheese and throw it in a cup with a little bit of sauce and wrap the two pieces of eggplant in foil??? The manager was very rude and practically threw my bag of food at me when I told him that I just will not come back if it was that big of a hassle. I refuse to spend that much money for a soggy sandwich. Will definitely take my business elsewhere.

frankys-st-charles,Smart C.,JkXvcmOL9655sVyPKQq8_A,S_egRIGbheSoEVCd2crD1g,"We (me and the boyfriend) came here for lunch the other day.  Boyfriend had been here when they first opened, and warned me that he had long wait time, and wondered if they had improved their work flow since.

Food is good.  Not super, not awful, but good.  Hot dog was dressed well, fries were crisp and not greasy, although some were a tad underdone to my taste.  Burger was a bit dry, but edible.  I am interested in exploring a lot more of their menu.  They have pizza slices that looked good in the &#34;pizza stand&#34; they had on the counter and for sure I&#39;d like to try some of the more dressed burgers and the eggplant parmesan sandwich.  So, food was good.

The problem here is that they have major problems with their workflow.  Order taker takes your order and you go wait by the cashier on the other side of the counter.  BUT, they don&#39;t take your money until your food is up, and your food is apparently prepared in a single flow, first in, first out.  Some kind of handwritten tickets on paper, instead of tickets with stubs. So, there was a huge business lunch order ahead of us (called in??), and everyone got stuck waiting and waiting and waiting, til the *entire* order was completed then painfully rung up.  HUGE bottleneck. Someone should have been working that order separately from the line of individual customers tapping their toes waiting. They need a good POS system, so you pay when you order, and they need another guy or two in the back working the orders more than one at a time, so they can be multitasked.  We looked behind the counter, and there is ONE guy busting his butt on the grill, running around doing everything.  Someone needs to get in there with him, queue up the orders and prep the trays, etc., so things move better.  The grill area is tiny, as well.  

We&#39;ll give them one more chance to fix up their work flow so it doesn&#39;t take 10+ minutes to get a hotdog, fries and a burger, but if they&#39;re still fumbling around with getting the orders taken, paid for, and delivered, we won&#39;t be back, and we don&#39;t expect them to survive a year.",22/03/14,246,3,1,3,8,2.930300000000001,3.27,1.3900000000000001,17.341,No,2111

We found the food to be very good.  I had the Hanger Steak with Burgundy Sauce.  I ordered it medium, and it was cooked to perfection.  My only wish would have been if it were made known that in addition to the burgundy sauce (served on the side, yay!) it was also going to come with sauteed mushrooms.  Not a fan of mushrooms, so they could have saved themselves the trouble and left them off.  The fries that accompanied my steak were crispy and fresh.  My dining partner had the Pork Shoulder in Cognac Sauce.  Again very well cooked, and awesome flavors.  For desert we had the &#34;French Kiss&#34;, which is apple stuffed crepe with a small scoop of ice cream..  It was Yummy.

Service was painfully slow and disorganized. A waitress finally came to us about 20 minutes after being seated to take our drink order and, no more than 30 seconds after she left, a different waitress came to do the same thing.

Our meal took over 2 hours for no reason, and we were starving by the time our entrees finally arrived. For better or worse, it was happening to tables all around us; drinks (even just water refills) would take 10 minutes to happen. Very, very slow service all-around. The only saving grace was the amazing band who provided a nice distraction.

Food was hit or miss, mostly the latter. I enjoyed the Cantaloupe Asparagus Pancetta appetizer, but my entree was an insult; I had the Salmon and Brie platter, which had amazing presentation, and that was it -- amazing presentation. The salmon looks plentiful (see my photos), but when I went to take a piece, I discovered it was two thin pieces of salmon stacked on lettuce leaves! Wow. For $15, you could give a better portion than that. The brie was also super thinly-sliced. The Roasted Pork Shoulder and Cornish Hen made the diners feel sick.

Band or no band, it&#39;s only so long before hunger turns into hanger and you start asking for extra bread rolls to tide over. When your entrees cost $25-40, include a caution label about the slow service -- Call it &#34;relaxed,&#34; whatever. -- or bring the items out at a reasonable pace. Because relaxed is the opposite of what the patio was. Every single person sitting out there was antsy in anticipation of their food, and that made it uncomfortable rather than enjoyable.

TLDR -- nice garden and live music (when it&#39;s there), but don&#39;t expect to dine in under 2 hours, and certainly do not come hungry. Food was not great.",19/06/16,217,2,1,2,-17,1.2006999999999999,3.289,2.438,15.273,No,1848

South Barrington, Il - 2/16/2016

This is my second time at this restaurant... Having enjoyed a wonderful meal last time I decided that since I was in town I would return...

As you walk in the first you hear is the French music of Charles Tren̩t playing in the background setting the stage for what undoubtedly will be a fabulous dining experience. . .

 Louis Charles Auguste Claude Trenet, known as Charles Trenet, was a French singer and songwriter. He was most famous for his recordings from the late 1930s until the mid-1950s, though his career continued through the 1990s. Wikipedia

Warmly greeted by the mątre d&#39; I was immediately escorted to my table...

My server brought out warmed French rolls served with tapenade... Tapenade is a Proven̤al  dish consisting of pur̩ed or finely chopped olives, capers, anchovies and olive oil.

To cleanse the palate in preparation for the main event... A goat cheese salad consisting of mixed field greens, perfectly sliced apples and a breaded and fried round of goat cheese. All this dressed in a raspberry vinaigrette. Makes me want to learn French just to be able to tell the chef exactly how wonderful the salad was...

And for my main course this evening... the Dover Sole Almandine &#34;fillet tableside&#34; served with almonds, lemon butter and root vegetables... The mix this evening...baby carrots, turnips and green beans... and to complete the plating,  a round of couscous garnished with a sprig of parsley,  micro greens and a carved lemon half...

The tableside filleting of a Dover Sole something you should experience at least once in your life. My server became visibly nervous at the revelation that  thousands of people would be viewing the procedure...

No fine dining experience would be complete without the desert... This evening&#39;s selection along with my signature cappuccino will be at the Tarte Tatin, an upside down pastry filled with caramelized apples which is then baked to perfection... as with the other dishes..., the presentation is something to behold... Caramel sauce, ice cream and a raspberry garnished with mint leaf...

I entered and no one greeted me, so I was a bit confused and thought they were closed....I stood there for a while and still no one talked to me, so I left and then when my friend arrived, we both when in together and finally, we were greeted.  I think we were in the off-hours before happy hour and dinner and after lunch.

We tried some sparkling wine which was good and then the cheese/pate.  I will say that it was quite good, however, I would have liked a little more toast and the sizes of each piece of cheese/pate were not very large.  For 2 people, it was ok, but for any more than 2 unless there were other appetizers, I would think you&#39;d need more.

We talked for a while and then decided on dinner.  I had the crepe with mushrooms and chicken - La Maison.  It was quite delicious - very rich and flavorful - I couldn&#39;t finish all of it.

Service was somewhat spotty...we had three servers due to the time we were there, so we had to explain things a few extra times, but once we were finally seated, they were attentive.

Cute spot and looks like it has a really cute patio.  Also, you can shop before dinner at all of the great stores nearby, so it&#39;s definitely a winner.

It&#39;s such a charming little place. If it wasn&#39;t so humid, I would&#39;ve wanted to sit outside.

Ordered escargot, charcuterie, &amp; duck confit eggs benedict. 

The escargot was weird tasting. It would&#39;ve been good if it didn&#39;t taste so muddy? It really needed the garlic, butter, parsley mixture, but even that didn&#39;t cover the muddy taste. I&#39;ve had escargot before and it never tasted like that. 

The charcuterie was a perfect starter. The bread was warm and toasty &amp; everything was delicious.

The duck confit eggs benedict came with a spring salad. The salad dressing was great, as it cut through the richness of the dish. I&#39;m a huge fan of eggs benedict, but never had it this way. I enjoyed it!

It&#39;s on the same curb as the Bath n body works/ table de la sur or something x). This place is really good in terms of service and decor. The service I thought was pretty quick and very very professional. Kelly kept addressing me as &#34;Sir&#34; and checked up on me very often. 

They had different kinds of croissants for $3, going around on the fly in a tray, which I thought was good marketing and getting something started for the customers. But maybe I thought to myself - it&#39;s a french restaurant they should serve some complimentary bread, but anyhow that was just me !!  Had the chocolate filled croissant (they had almond and something else too).

I had the banana walnut french toast which was good. Now there were 2 big slices of bread cut into 4 triangular pieces with a warm caramel syrup with bananas and roasted walnuts. I finished two of them b y slowly getting the topping with my fork and having it with the toast. But then I realized I am not getting enough, so for the last two I kinda just joined both of them - made it one whole bread, took the topping and poured it over and it was YUMMM... Hot caramel w/banana and roasted walnuts were really good. It&#39;s pretty heavy but I was really hungry when I got there.

With pretense of being a French bistro it is more like a chain restaurant. The space and ambiance are very good (chairs could be more comfortable and table cloths sized to properly fit tables) but service and kitchen were mediocre albeit with likely good intentions. We order a bottle of Bordeaux from the wine list and when the server returned he began to open a pour - but it was the wrong bottle and significantly more expensive than the one ordered. After the manager intervened and talked about changing the wine list we got the bottle for the menu price. But wait, there is more. After the wine was decanted both the server and manager walked past the table a number of times, stared at the decanter, and left each time without pouring - even the staff at Outback know to pour for the customer. Menu was large and ambitious - smoked salmon was good but salad Lynonnais was interesting. Presentation was good but a harsh vinaigrette dressing certainly was not French bistro style. Mussel entree was OK - must have had 40+ shells but contents small or empty but price compensated. Biggest disappointment was the hanger steak.

First, we walk in and the host tells us it will be about 15-20 minutes. Ok, that&#39;s doable. We sit down at the bar, and about an hour later we are sat for our meal. I truly thought he had forgotten about us.  Then once we&#39;re seated, we are sat between 3 large tables with children running around. I get there&#39;s not much that can be done about that, but it just wasn&#39;t really what i had in mind for my upscale french meal. The lighting was a little bit too bright too, which cheapened the experience a bit. 

The food was really just OK. I had the croque madame, which i&#39;ve had before and it was excellent, but this one was burned (I was so hungry at this point I just didn&#39;t even care.) My husband had a $28 pork dish that was completely under seasoned. Had it been me that ordered it I would have sent it back. It just... wasn&#39;t good. 

The server kept apologizing for how slow things were moving out of the kitchen, but we truthfully didn&#39;t even notice. Had she not brought it up consistently, even offering us free dessert, that is something we wouldn&#39;t have taken note of. 

It really felt like they just didn&#39;t really have things figured out over there, all the servers were running frenetically, the host was bussing tables, the lights were too bright... i don&#39;t know what this place is doing but they should probably hire a FOH manager, or fire and replace their current one.",04/03/15,155,2,2,2,15,1.9841000000000002,1.765,1.061,13.174,No,1578

Hungry, we decided to stay. Unfortunately the service was not up to their previous standards as our server seemed distracted, forgetting simple requests like bread, butter, silverware Etc. And being constantly reminded of them. After just delivering our salads, he came racing out of the kitchen with our appetizers and standing over our table unsure of what to do. I finally told him we weren&#39;t ready for the appetizers since we just received our salads 5 min ago. The main entree didn&#39;t seem to have the pizazz that our first experience provided, And we all left feeling that this experience was really one of the worst dining experiences we encountered. My advice? Check to see if they are using pre-fixe menu (and avoid going) and ask for a different server once you start seeing flaws in service.",09/05/16,121,2,1,0,-20,-0.6317999999999999,0.7939999999999999,0.572,9.635,No,1121

They serve one mean bloody mary.   Perfect mix of salty peppered rim.  Two large meaty olives.  Celery.  I loved that they used pepper rather than hot sauce to turn up the heat.  I could have made a meal of it!

Don&#39;t miss the bread basket guy that comes around with rolls and olive/sundried tomato tamponade.

Beef bourguignon crepe was a savory treat.  Tender, well seasoned beef folded into a large eggy crepe.  It came witha  side salad, not too impressed by the mustard vinagrette.

We started off with a couple of appetizers, the escargot and the cheese plate. I have a small obsession with cheese plates and have to get one whenever it&#39;s offered.

It&#39;s the perfect little French getaway, smack dab in the Barrington Arboretum. It had been on my &#34;to try&#34; list for quite some time, and I wish I had gotten there sooner. 

The customer service is top notch. The waiter was on top of making sure we had everything we wanted - bread, wine, drinks, appetizers. I could tell the staff goes above and beyond to make sure their guests are satisfied. 

I wasn&#39;t overly hungry and was bummed to see that there wasn&#39;t any crepes on the dinner menu ((BOO!!)) So, I went with the Pasta Jardin instead. I wasn&#39;t disappointed. It wasn&#39;t what I had expected either. I was give a plate of grilled tomatoes, zucchini, asparagus, eggplant, saut̩ed spinach, with rice fettuccini. It basically was a deconstructed pasta dish. The veggies were perfectly grilled and seasoned. My friend went with the Souris D&#39;Agneau ((braised lamb shank)) and the crab stuffed squash blossoms appetizer. I tried the lamb. It was juicy and tender and didn&#39;t have that gamey taste that sometimes lamb can have. Given my strong distaste for seafood, I passed on trying the squash blossoms.

The decor itself was elegant, romantic, and definitely sets the stage for a killer date night out. It made for a nice girls night out as well. ((Apparently Wednesday is ladies night for $5 martinis))

I had a couple disappointments, which leads me to the explanation of my 3 star rating. ((Once again, I wish I could do 3.5!)) The food was way overpriced. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was delicious - but not cheap whatsoever. Thank goodness for restaurant.com coups! I was also disappointed there weren&#39;t any savory crepes on the dinner menu. In fact, the menu only offered one kind on the dessert menu. I suppose that means I&#39;ll have to go back and give their crepes a try during breakfast or lunch. 

I still need to get my crepe fix, so I anticipate I&#39;ll be back in the near future. Dessert crepes and martinis sounds like a pretty happy, happy hour.",13/08/12,255,4,2,5,27,7.5344999999999995,5.703999999999999,0.523,22.773,No,2047

It was pretty quiet for a Saturday morning. We each ordered a crepe since that was their speciality. I ordered the one with shrimp, wild mushroom, and sausage in cajun sauce. OMG, it was DELICIOUS! Very savory and tasty! I loved it! 

One of my friends didn&#39;t like her too much because she felt the crepe was too thin and it was too savory for her. It was very saucey. She ordered the braised beef one. She prefers mostly vegetarian dishes but she decided to try something different which she regret, however, she said it was okay but way too savory for her liking.

My other friend enjoyed her crepe as much as I did! It was yummy!

Having lived in Chicago &amp; the suburbs my whole life, I dare say it&#39;s the best beef sandwich I&#39;ve ever had.  (((Prepares to be pelted)))  The beef is just so tender &amp; the bread alone is fantastic!

My gyro-connoisseur husband really enjoyed the gyro he ordered and even had some leftovers for the next day, which never happens!

The beef seems to be a smidge thicker-cut than other places, and extremely tender.  The spices used are deliciously addictive - lots of garlic, red pepper flakes, and other deliciousness - it literally melts in your mouth &amp; that makes me one happy gal.

From this single happenstance experience, I abandoned my trusty standby (Augustino&#39;s) &amp; ordered Patelli&#39;s beef as an accompaniment to my Christmas dinner lineup.  To say it was a hit is an understatement.  My guests knew it was different, and EVERYONE asked where we got it.  In fact, my nephew-in-law ate all their leftover beef before my niece got any!

The catering order process was flawless.  The gentleman on the line was so friendly, polite, and very helpful.  I didn&#39;t get his name, but Patellis West Chicago:  he was one who offered to work late on Christmas Eve.  (We picked up our order early, but he offered to stay late if need be.)  He was really enthusiastic and so helpful!  Definitely a keeper!

Included with our delicious beef catering order was the softest French bread I&#39;ve ever had, more than enough sweet peppers &amp; mouth-watering giardiniera, serving utensils for *everything,* PLUS forks, knives, plates, - all the stuff you never ask for but realize you need at the last minute!  A lot of places charge extra for these niceties;  Patellis viewed them as 
necessities, and it really helped a lot during the last-minute serving melee.
 
For years I&#39;ve ordered beef from both Portillo&#39;s (10% - I find it too fatty) and Augustino&#39;s (90% - I love their spices) and I will say if Patelli&#39;s keeps doing what it&#39;s doing, they will eventually rule the area Italian Beef catering game.

There were three workers, two of whom were doing lots of multitasking in the way of cooking food (chicken on the grill, some dessert/chips). I got Guy #3, who looked bored as f#ck and not in any hurry. I was second in line and my order was taken after nearly 10 minutes. Not exaggerating.

I ordered:
- side of falafel
- Steak* Laffa Wrap w/garlic sauce, olives, saut̩ed onions, couscous, and veggies.
             * steak = $1.50 upcharge

Total = $12


My second mistake (the first = sticking around) was not checking out the goods before ordering! The steak and falafel were sparse and looked old.. Guy #3 DID nicely put some fresh falafel into the fryer when I asked him about it.

I noticed that, while he was assembling my wrap, there were lots of charred steak flakes at the bottom of the container. I think he noticed, too, because he stopped using the scoop and chose the rest with his (gloved) hands.


Verdict:

Falafel: 2/5
The good: Nice and crispy on the outside. Who doesn&#39;t love hot fresh falafel?!

The bad: Barely a trace of spice/heat. And WHAT is the weird consistency they&#39;ve got going on?! The insides are so wet and mushy! I LOVE falafel and wasn&#39;t feelin&#39; this AT ALL.


Steak Wrap: 3/5
The good: Some good crunch with the veggies, good texture in the couscous (i.e. not mushy) and the garlic sauce was good.

The bad: Dry, charred steak, and NOT in a good way. The burnt taste lingered in my mouth. It was also super salty. I paid extra for this?! Yuck.

Roti is a great place to go when you don&#39;t want that Chipotle burrito (which is rare) or a lunchtime sammie. The spice, freshness, and variety really stir up your culinary routine. 

BUT whenever I go through the live I feel like everything I get is so small for the cost. They have the tiniest little scoopers to put on the sides. They don&#39;t get you a ton of meat- probably a satisfing amount for an 8 yo child. And they only give you a limited number of sauces. I highly recommend getting the taziki (sp?), garlic, and the dill. Don&#39;t get the hummus unless you like bland paste- much more flavor in the other sauces. AND they count the hummus as &#34;one of your three.&#34; 

My husband gets the pita and he always wants to get something additional like the fried balls ( I forget exactly what they&#39;re called...)

This place IS delicious, clean, and dependable. Just plan on buying two meals if you&#39;re starving AND paying a boatload for both. :)",28/05/15,124,3,2,3,22,2.4496,2.487,0.79,10.723,No,1024

The pita bread is small and although it wasn&#39;t dry, it was not fluffy like Naf Naf&#39;s. Their sauces are terrific, but they are stingier here and charge 50 cents for additional. 

Service was average, do not care attitude. Not rude though. So that&#39;s a plus.

The portions are incredibly tiny...maybe they should utilize a smaller plate because the way it is now it leaves you feeling like you got ripped off. The price is cheaper than Naf Naf grill, but the portions are also much smaller.

We got the rice plate with falafel, egglant, and red cabbage. The eggplant was cold and the red cabbage has practically zero fermentation. The falafel was more of a tater tot, the filling was smooth unlike the falafel I am used to. I am also not a fan of lukewarm food, which everything was. I much prefer fresh made falafel (Pita Inn).

As a french fry enthusiast, I missed not having french fries as a side option. Didn&#39;t try their meat but the area around the meat rotation devices looked rather dirty. And thats coming from someone whose favorite gyro shop is a hole in the wall. 

In the end, i just ended up eating mostly rice since the side portions were ridiculously small. I&#39;d rather go to Pita Inn, Naf Naf Grill, or Maoz Vegetarian. I would rather pay a bit more, leave full, and be happy about a place than go somewhere that charges extra for every last sauce. 

Also they have a reward program which I always appreciate. But it&#39;s an app and you have to take a picture of your receipt and then upload it. Seems like a bad use of technology and time consuming endeavor for the customer.

TLDR: small portions, falafel has tater tot texture, lukewarm temperature food (did not order meat), sauces good. Maybe it&#39;s this location #meh #firsttime",07/11/15,233,2,1,1,-23,0.7143,2.639,1.8860000000000001,19.475,No,1828

First I went to wash my hands before eating. Men&#39;s bathroom is dirty and needs to be cleaned. Not a good start. I ordered the rice plate with fallafal and three sides; hummus, eggplant, and red cabbage. The rice plate also comes with 2 small wheat pitas and 2 sauces, I opted to get a 3rd sauce. Let&#39;s start with the good. The sauces are great. I got them on the side in plastic containers. The tahini, dill sauce, and the sweet spicy red sauce are da bomb. That&#39;s where the good stuff ends. The fallafal was cold and the inside was of baby food texture sort of like a frozen tater tot gone awry. The small wheat pitas were cold and dry. The sides were so-so I preferred the hummus out of the 3, but come on now it&#39;s hummus. My big issue is with the portions. The portions are extremely small. I got the smallest amount of cabbage and eggplant. Compared to naf Naf which I see as direct competition they are slacking. Naf Naf is pricier but the portions are not only larger but the fallafal are crispy and their pita is done so well. I&#39;m not sure if this is due to the location but I will give Roti one more chance since a new one is opening near my house.

For $7.95 I got a rice plate with three sides.  I got some falafel &amp; some hummus.  The bread was nice &amp; warm &amp; the hummus was pretty good.  I was very surprised eating here because I didn&#39;t have that high of expectations.  To me most Mediterranean food needs long prep times so I was surprised when I saw that they were able to set it up like a Chipolte.  


The place was about the size of a Chipolte or a Qdoba with the same type of layout.  We came right after the lunch crowd but the place was very clean &amp; the staff was friendly.  Another plus about this place is that they don&#39;t skim on the portions.  The portions were more than enough to fill a person up.  

They have a lot of different sauces &amp; sides that fit a any of the dishes you choose.  The parking lot has a lot of spots to park in &amp; it is close to the door.

This restaurant is located about 3 minutes from Woodfield mall.  It is right across the street from one of the roads to their parking lot so it is a convenient location for some mall shoppers.  The plaza that it is located in is very new &amp; was built only a few years ago.

roti-modern-mediterranean-schaumburg,Laura N.,LFzCNWu8tIxGNPk358QVJg,eAoQmB37Aj-YcYPs6c_7Bg,"After seeing rave reviews for this place by a few of my favorite Yelpers, I knew I had to swing by as soon as I could -- which was a cold Black Friday night. However, there&#39;s a problem with reading great reviews before trying a new place: you kind of have high expecations. At least, that happened to me with Roti. And I think that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t love the place as much as I probably should have.

Roti is, like several others have mentioned, basically a Chipotle-style Mediterranean food place. You walk up to the counter, choose from several dish options (sandwich, rice place, or salad), select your toppings and sides, and have your meal ready as soon as you&#39;ve paid for it. Fast food without being typical fast food. It&#39;s not original, but it works.

I did drool over all the options -- couscous, salmon, veggies, cucumber/tomato salads, etc. -- and took my sweet time figuring out what I wanted. The women working behind the counter were very helpful and enabled me to choose everything I wanted to try. Yet, my jaw nearly dropped when I saw our total bill was $25. I honestly wasn&#39;t expecting that. Everything just added up. An extra $2 for the salmon, an extra $4 for our two drinks.... It wasn&#39;t terribly expensive, but we were hoping to spend just a little bit less (usually we spend about $15 at Chipotle). 

It WAS filling, I&#39;ll give them that, but it wasn&#39;t amazingly delicious. My small portion of veggies (I literally ate the whole portion in two bites) was kind of burned and tasteless, the rice was just rice, and the salmon wasn&#39;t impressive (nor did I think it was worth the extra two bucks). The couscous and the tomato/cucumber were my favorite. I skipped the sauces (sauces aren&#39;t my thing) but I did try my husband&#39;s roasted pepper sauce and it wasn&#39;t too bad.

I&#39;m not writing this place off just yet. I think next time I just need to skip the salmon and opt for water. That alone will save me a few bucks, and I can better appreciate the food that I actually liked here, while trying a few other items.

I mean, I really do need to come back soon.... that couscous was so damn good!",10/12/13,254,4,1,4,9,3.8519000000000005,2.6540000000000004,1.1689999999999998,19.177999999999997,No,2163

For the most part, to me, even when it&#39;s good Mediterranean food, it&#39;s still kind of just meh... 

So imagine my surprise while trying out Schaumburg&#39;s newest chain fast-fare, only to find it&#39;s absolutely phenomenal. Like, whoa. If I lived near here, I&#39;d come at least once a week... and obvi join the Roti frequent customer club to get more free falafel. 

I was waffling between a wrap, pita, or rice plate, but settled on the $7.95 rice plate because I would get to choose 3 sides. Please note, not all sides are listed on the menu, but the person who puts your order together will offer all while building your plate, which is a good thing because otherwise I would&#39;ve missed out on the most delicious olive salad ever. 

With my falafel rice plate came 4 falafel balls, I got two mini pitas, a buncha rice, hummus, grilled vegetables, the olive salad and I chose the tahini sauce, though there were a number of sauces I wanted to try, namely the spicy and cucumber dill. Next time. 

I added on two baklava triangles at check-out for my partner and I, and was on my merry way to a seat in the dining area. My partner said he wasn&#39;t hungry, but I knew he&#39;d change his tune once face-to-face with falafel. Lo-and-behold, I was right. We ended up splitting the whole thing and practically fighting for the last few bites. If it hadn&#39;t been so close to closing, I would&#39;ve totally gone up and ordered more. 

I love that serve both bottles and tap Honest Tea (my favorite!), and that for $11 I got enough food for myself, and my partner with 2 desserts. 

My partner and I were totally the jerks who stayed until 2-minutes before their closing time and as we left, we saw every employee at the food bar cleaning up AND, get this -- smiling.

It&#39;s a Mediterranean chain that is quickly taking over the Chicagoland area. It&#39;s the next best thing for food packed with flavor without the added calories. Roti is the perfect example that you can eat fast food that&#39;s fresh and healthy and delicious. 

Roti is unique since it draws flavors and popular dishes from all over the Mediterranean like kabobs, hummus, and falafel but it&#39;s presented in Chipotle&#39;s easy to order format. Not familiar with Mediterranean cuisine? Think spices like turmeric, cumin, and coriander and ingredients like dill, olives, feta, and cous cous. The food is flavorful and healthier since it uses herbs, spices, and vinegars rather than butter and fat. I read the other reviews and it sounds like some people had a bad experience when they first opened but I just went on Sunday and service was fine - the chicken was just a little dry and overcooked. Other than that, the food was great and I&#39;ll definitely be back. 

Pro tip: order the salad since it&#39;s the same price as the plate but without the limitations on sides. You can literally order each one of the sides (even add rice) and all of the toppings for no additional cost. For some reason, the plate only allows you to choose three sides but there&#39;s no limit for the salad even though it costs the same.

Think a Mediterranean version of a Chipotle.  Ok, well now you&#39;ve got the picture.  You walk up, pick an option (sandwich, salad, or rice plate), and then walk along to choose your toppings and sauces.  You get the idea, right?

They usually have a good selection of music playing inside Roti.  I do enjoy listening to Mumford &amp; Sons while I chow down, although it makes me want to shovel the cous cous, falafel, and hummus into my mouth along with the beat.
Speaking of, have you all watched Mumford &amp; Sons - Hopeless Wanderer music video?  If you haven&#39;t you are missing out.  Not only is it a good song, but it is F-ing hilarious!  Watch all five minutes, not a minute less, because that last minute or so is where it&#39;s at.  You can thank me afterwards.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rId6PKlDXeU

You&#39;re welcome. Now back to Roti...

*The falafel is made with organic chickpeas.  Crunchy on the outside, and oh so creamy on the inside.

*And hold the phone, they have Salmon!  That&#39;s right, Salmon!  Whoa - whoa - wee- wah!  For a couple bucks more, you can add the Gulf of Maine Salmon as your meat option.

*The Vegetable Mix near the meats are kind of blah in my opinion, so I would skip them if you&#39;ve picked a limited side option.  If you have unlimited sides, well then do whatever your vegetable lovin&#39; self pleases.

*All the other sides are so delicious that I have a hard time deciding which to choose.  For your sake, I hope you never find yourself in line behind me.  And if by chance you do, you should probably offer to pay the extra 50 cents per each extra side on top of the allotted amount of my rice plate.  Hummus, Tomato and Cucumber Salad, Spanish Eggplant, Cous-cous, Red Cabbage Slaw.  Get out the quarters, I&#39;m getting them all.

*Who doesn&#39;t want to add feta cheese, olives, and onions as well?  I love me some feta...probably too much, but that&#39;s besides the point.  Let&#39;s be honest, Feta tastes great on any Mediterranean meal.

*And the sauces.  Don&#39;t get me started.  Ok, well too late, I&#39;ve started.  I&#39;d say my favories would be the Cucumber and Yogurt, Tahini, and Roasted Red Pepper.  It&#39;s all dependent on what you&#39;re getting, but you can&#39;t go wrong.

I dropped in and ordered two rice plates to go. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes for less than $20. One rice plate covered me for two meals and here are a few things I really enjoyed...

Chicken Roti - Flavorful, tender chunks of spiced chicken

Pita -You can choose one or two pitas per plate. I was kicking myself that I went carb light and chose just one per  plate. Dammit. These pitas was warm, pillowy and delicious.

Hummus - A nom-worthy addition to any of your rice plate items.

roti-modern-mediterranean-schaumburg,Sarah S.,QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q,aTGrvy-K7kHpWspeoPkteg,"Oh my~~~ I am SO full and I only ate half of my rice plate. I was lucky enough to be one of the chosen ones to attend a soft opening for the new Roti Mediterranean Grill in Schaumburg today. The location is insanely convenient to my company and it&#39;s a fresh, healthier option than other things in the area so I&#39;m excited. My coworkers that live in the city have told me of the goodness that is Roti, however I had never tried it until today. I must say, I&#39;m now a big fan.

I&#39;ve been to soft openings before, as well as newly opened businesses and Roti was flowing so much more smoothly than most I&#39;ve been to. We were greeted by a few different people when we walked in. Everyone was eager to explain the food &amp; concept plus all were really friendly. 

The way you order is a similar concept to Chitpotle :
1. You decide the basic way you want your food - either a sandwich (laffa wrap or pita pocket - $6.95), rice plate (your choice of 3 sides/toppings + pita bread - $7.95) or salad (comes with a pita - $7.95).
2. You place your order with the first person behind the counter &amp; also let them know what type of meat/main item you&#39;d like - Chicken Kabab, Chicken Roti, Steak Roti, Salmon, Falafel or Fresh Veggies.
3. You then go through the line and they ask if you&#39;d like sauce on the side or spread throughout your meal (Dill, Yogurt &amp; Cucumber, Roasted Red Pepper, Tahini, S&#39;hug or Roti Vinagrette) and what sides or toppings you&#39;d like (tomato &amp; cucumbers, feta cheese, fresh veggies, spanish eggplant, olives, sumac onions, red cabbage slaw, cous-cous or hummus).
4. Wham, bam, thank you Ma&#39;am - you&#39;re done &amp; you pay, adding any extras you want such as a fountain drink or cookie. 
*If you&#39;re the indecisive type or would like to trust Roti, they have some special combos that you can pick instead of picking your own ingredients*

Today they had a steady stream of people coming through the line and all was flowing so surprisingly smoothly, it bares mentioning again.

I had their rice plate with Chicken Kabab, Feta Cheese, Cous-cous, Hummus, and Dill, Cucumber &amp; Yogurt sauce over the meat &amp; rice. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the dill sauce. All ingredients tasted quite fresh, nothing was overdone, the chicken was nice &amp; moist and it all was so delicious! The portion was so huge that I ended up taking half home for dinner. They have plastic tops that will snap onto the plate if needed. I really liked the concept of not creating more waste with styrofoam containers and using the plate you were already eating off of as half the take home container. My entire plate was just 568 calories, so eating half of it was the perfect amount of food for me and at just 284 calories a very healthy lunch.

They have a fountain drink station which could only be improved if it was a Coke Freestyle. Either that or have another Diet/Zero option aside from Coke. I must say this station was extremely clean and stayed clean throughout the hour we dined in. There were honestly a zillion workers in today making sure all went as planned. I don&#39;t know if this is the norm but a nice gentlemen came around and cleared our table for us. Not only that, but another came around to offer us a chocolate chip cookie that was sweet &amp; soft &amp; yummy in my tummy!

They have an app in which you can photograph your receipt &amp; earn points towards free food. A great concept that I&#39;m surprised more bars &amp; restaurants haven&#39;t picked up on. One downfall is that Schaumburg isn&#39;t yet on the app despite them heavily advertising it today.

I really liked their food, this branch is just like any Chipotele or Qdoba, order food and take it and sit wherever you like. Found the prices to be very reasonable and worth for the amount of food that was given - everything is based on pita and some form of meat/veggie and/or rice. 

So I made my own salad for dinner - added in the chicken kabobs (which were good and heavy), then after choosing the meat, you get as many add-ons as possible and then you get choice of 2 sauces - went with dill yogurt and spicy sauce (good combo - definitely recommend it), side of hummus and pita bread. Trust me - it definitely fills a hungry guy up :). If you like Mediterranean you would definitely like this place. I have not tried the cous-cous before , that was also added in the salad, which was good. Servers were helpful and friendly.

roti-modern-mediterranean-schaumburg,Andrew J.,HhBaavr8N_1DYclbr3xpvQ,QWwenUzsojHdHwJwZIw6jQ,"It&#39;s a Mediterranean Chipotle. The service is fast and great. The food is fresh and uses free range, organic-ish products. The atmosphere is industrial chic (love it). So what&#39;s the deal?

Well, the deal is I&#39;m just not in love with the food. If you have never had couscous or falafel or schwarma or kabob, this is an OK starter kit, but it&#39;s pretty far from the source material. In some ways the comparison to Chipotle really works against a place like this. Here&#39;s why:

Chipotle, whether you are a fan or not (I am a fan), has got food that is entirely recognizable in form and flavor as Mexican fare. The guac is fantastic and, oddly, rivals some of the better Mexican restaurants in the area. Tacos are still tacos. They are built the same way. Meat on the bottom, followed by sauce and lettuce on the top. Burritos are still burritos. Same as burritos that you get anywhere else (though probably larger). 

The kabob pita sandwich I had at Roti illustrated that it&#39;s different with Mediterranean fare. See, Mediterranean fare is about distribution of elements, not layers of elements. The Chipotle format doesn&#39;t allow for any nuances, such as tossing the ingredients together or applying sauces anywhere other than a single area in the sandwich. The pita has to be stuffed in the order in which you choose the ingredients. The result is a pita that is cold and doesn&#39;t have much flavor with odd, segregated pockets of pita components. 

Hummus isn&#39;t the sour cream from Chipotle. You can&#39;t take a big spoonful and fwap it in the middle of a sandwich. A) This hummus is such a neutral flavor B) It&#39;s ice cold and quite dense (and you&#39;re putting it on a hot sandwich) C) Hummus is meant to line the inside of the pita to keep the other sauces from spilling out. It should be a persistent flavor and texture, not a big spoonful of cold, pasty sauce in the middle of the sandwich. Also, chicken (or whatever protein) needs to be tossed with cucumbers and tomatoes and lettuce. Again, you can&#39;t just have a tomato and cucumber part of the pita and a chicken part of the pita. It&#39;s about interplay of flavor. That&#39;s not what I got. I just ended up eating the chicken part.

But the problems continue with the falafel, which is hardly falafel at all. The flavor and texture are completely different. The falafel at Roti taste like fried samosa filling. It&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s not falafel. Good falafel have a much better crunch, a more granulated and bright green interior, and don&#39;t taste like coriander or cumin. They taste more like light garlic and herbs. Again, it&#39;s not that the falafel here tasted bad, but if this is your first falafel experience, expect something entirely different when you order them elsewhere. 

My wife had a Sultan Sandwich, which was better than my pita, but neither of us were blown away. The flavor was pretty muted, which is unlike any Mediterranean place I&#39;ve eaten at. Also the sandwich had more of a pickled flavor than spice, so... ehhh.

The thing is, if you&#39;re not crunched for time and running out for lunch, there are far, far better pita places in the suburbs that are far more satisfying and are maybe a bit cheaper. You&#39;ll wait longer for your food, but if you can afford the time you&#39;ll have a better experience and much more flavorful food. While Chipotle can (at times) rival decent authentic Mexican restaurants in flavor, I can&#39;t say the same is true with Roti and other places out there.

Not everyone likes the same things, so maybe you should check them out for yourself. This restaurant is affable enough, but the obvious comparison to Chipotle just made me think of a place I&#39;d rather be. I&#39;d normally give a restaurant like this 2 stars, but I&#39;ll round up because this is a new place, I only had the one experience,  and the employees are really likeable folks.  Unfortunately, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll see them again anytime soon. Sorry guys.",15/08/14,441,3,3,3,96,2.858199999999999,4.178,3.0719999999999996,39.751000000000005,No,4009

Their salad is AMAZINGLY good. Yes, I said it. Add every option possible (except rice) and don&#39;t forget the red sauce (I forgot what it was called) but it&#39;s hot! Anyway, the blast of flavor will knock you off your seat. This is probably the best fast food salad I&#39;ve ever had. 
Now their falafel is another story... Oh. My. God. The best falafel ever!!! Worth the $2 (and change) for a  3 piece 1 biter falafel. MUST HAVE for sure. 
Now why I gave this place 3 stars and not 4? Because they had the same terrible service from totally different staff than my first visit. (Did that make sense?) what I&#39;m trying to say is the service is bad... I thought my first visit was bad, the 2nd visit is just as bad. They were cooking the steak when I ordered my food so they set aside my plate. After the steak was cooked and placed on the serving dish, 3 other people got served their steak and my rice plate which was getting cold was left sitting there with me standing in front of it and watching other people who were behind me get served.  I reminded the girl about my plate and (no joke or exaggeration) age put 4 pieces of steak on my plate. No apologies. The cashier saw and heard what happened so he went back to the dish and added a little bit more steak. At this point I was fuming but didn&#39;t want to show my anger to my friend who gave me the gift card.  Mr or Ms manager: please train your staff in customer service. It goes a long way. 
So to sum up: 
Great: chicken roti, salad, falafel, pita
Terrible: service, rice (too hard and dry), steak ( dry and not tender), you will walk away smelling like spicy food- please go home and wash your clothes and shower immediately. 
If I return to Roti, it&#39;s most likely not going to be at this location. Or I&#39;ll have my dear friend pick up a salad for me.",19/10/14,272,3,1,5,-44,5.2592,5.7250000000000005,1.6589999999999998,21.616999999999997,No,2113
roti-modern-mediterranean-schaumburg,Ryan T.,j1OtCuD6TXGyKyx_qr54xw,XfhTjIAkw8rPWWkEFaJbHg,I have to say the roti chicken pita is excellent. Everything tastes extremely fresh. I would agree that it is sort of similar to chipotle in terms of ambiance and set up. It&#39;s even a great place for someone who has never really tried Mediterranean. The only thing I am a little disappointed in is the portion size for what it costs. You are going to spend about $10+ per person if you get drink or any specialty items. I&#39;ve been there several times now and I noticed today the portion sizes are even smaller. I usually go every couple of months. I&#39;d probably go more frequently if it was less pricey because it is fast and good.,30/05/15,72,4,1,2,7,1.4613,1.295,0.40800000000000003,7.296,No,640

Family was not happy. I would give the food quality a 5/10. Rice and meat in Mediterranean cuisine are served hot or at least worm. Our chicken and steak Roti were both cold, so was the rice. The bread was very good, tehini and eggplant were also good. This is not Mediterranean food.
 
I would give service 3/10. The staff that took the orders was not attentive. I had to ask 3 times for 2 steak Roti and one chicken Roti. I asked for two waters and soda when I paid for the order, I got two cups for water but no cup for soda. When I mentioned to the manager that staff was not attentive, she was not apologetic at all, she just said they are new.
When another customer mentioned to the manager that the outdoor tables were wobbly, she didn&#39;t do anything. I had to go back and ask here again to get something to put under the table legs.

roti-modern-mediterranean-schaumburg,Lindsay J.,MfqxTbORCwIXWPbWaPrP7w,mgxtH-QpkOkhQkbhRLxFag,"Gosh, it&#39;s too bad I had the experience I did...I wanted to love Roti. A) I love the Chipotle concept: being able to pick what you do and don&#39;t want and say if you want more B) I love Middle Eastern food, think Naf Naf. Well, this is no Naf Naf nor did I feel comfortable asking for more like I would at Chipotle. 

I got a Falafel pita, the pita was awful. It definitely had been sitting for awhile. A long while. I added cucumber yogurt sauce (zatziki), tahini, lettuce and the tomato/cucumber mix (Israeli salad) to my pita. Good thing or the bread would have been inedible. The falafels were mushy and undercooked in my book, but I did read that some reviewers liked them that way. 
I also order the chicken kabob plate. It came with terrible rice, I think it&#39;s supposed to be basmati rice, but instead it tasted like perfume, and it was dry. I got the Spanish eggplant, good-tasted like salsa like the worker told me it would, the cous cous which was interesting in a good way and the tomato/cucumber salad which was also good. There was no pita left, so I waited for fresh pita, it was better than the pita for the sandwich but nothing, nothing like the gold standard of Naf Naf. The chicken was fine, the garlic sauce I got was good and made the chicken better. 

Bottom line, pita is where it&#39;s at for Mediterranean food. It&#39;s essential for a good falafel sandwich. (So is good falafel, by the way). I could see going again, only during peak hours when the food is fresh and getting turned over, but really, I&#39;ll probably go back to my old reliable...Naf Naf and drive further and pay more, but know I&#39;ll leave happy.",28/04/14,211,2,2,4,32,3.7539,3.299,2.023,12.677,No,1653

roti-modern-mediterranean-schaumburg,Phil S.,asP08n8OwVhIg2hyff8DFQ,C315V5_23EfooSHt9CYxMQ,"Easiest way to describe this place is: Mediterranean version of Chipotle

After seeing Sarah S. post that they are serving free lunch today for their grand opening, I hopped in the car got in line. A 20 minute line out the door with people sitting on the cold curb eating. Could it really be THAT good? 

I ordered the steak rice plate and my wife ordered &#34;The Best Plate Ever.&#34; 

So many options for sides, sauces, and toppings!

For being a chain restaurant, I was really surprised at how bold the flavors were and how fresh all the ingredients were.  I love Mediterranean style food and this place really hit the spot for a quick lunch style Mediterranean craving.  Being located directly across the street from towering office buildings, I can just imagine the lines that&#39;ll form here daily during the lunch hour.

The roti (bread) was fresh and warm and just chewy enough.  Perfect for slathering all that tasty hummus all over.

I know I&#39;m repeating myself but I was really surprised at how bold and bright all the flavors were for being a chain restaurant since they usually dumb down the flavors to appeal to the wider, blander American audience.  The juxtaposition of sour, sweet, and spicy flavors against the earthy rice and hummus had me swooning for more. I probably looked like a slob shoveling fork after fork in my face without pause, but I didn&#39;t care.

About a $10 meal with plate plus drink but not a bad deal. It certainly doesn&#39;t beat the Pita House deal of $4.95 for lunch but this place just kills it on the flavor scale making this a great lunch, or even dinner, choice.

There aren&#39;t many good middle-eastern restaurants choices around in the suburbs and I was happy to hear they were opening this popular city chain. I 100% agree with Laura N saying that reading some of the raving reviews can cause you to have HIGH expectations.  I also agree with other Yelpers that it is a like middle-eastern Chipotle! 

I will say, unfortunately, I was not as satisfied with this location as I was with the location near Union Station.  Either they changed recipes or the Union Station just cranks out better pita sandwiches.  Prior to eating at this location, I held Roti at the top of my list for Mediterranean food and unfortunately I left unsatisfied :( 

The feta is outstanding quality and was the star of the show. Awesome. 

I had the steak pita with veggies,  and spicy sauce and a side of falafel.  I&#39;m really picky about meat but the steak here sat well with me.  There was a weird (unfamiliar, un-Mediterranean) taste in my sandwich. This highly disappointed me as it tasted like vinegar sweetened with a pound of sugar.  Not very Mediterranean at all!  The spicy sauce was very good and flavorful and the steak was cooked nicely.  The falafel was rubbery and not crunchy like it should be... but it is made with organic chickpeas!  

If you were disappointed with this location, you should try the city locations because they are 10x better!

I just don&#39;t see this particular restaurant lasting if they continue to run operation like this. There are plenty of other restaurants like Potbelly&#39;s, Panera, Chipotle, etc in the area. You get much better value there.

There is a Subway and, ummmm, that&#39;s about it.  So when they got a Sir Nick&#39;s off of Palatine Road when I was about 14, that was pretty darn exciting!!

ALMOST as excited as I was to find out via Grubhub that there was one within delivery distance of my new house.  SCORE FOR ME.

They are pretty consistent between the two restaurants based on what I have ordered, and that&#39;s a good thing.  They were consistently delicious!!

This particular time, I ordered a gyro w/ extra sauce, chicken noodle soup, and curly fries.  My husband ordered a meat lovers pizza, which I stole a slice of and enjoyed immensely!

As for their soup--YUM!  The next time I am sick, I am going to remember Sir Nick&#39;s and their Chicken Noodle Soup.  This stuff is homemade, and it really soothes the soul!  Delicious!

My gyro was chocked full of thick-cut meat and the sauce is amazing.  Very flavorful.  Plus, on the gyro, there are diced tomatoes rather than two large slices that I have had in the past.  This was really good and helped to ensure a tomato in each bite!!  

The fries are pretty solid.  I really enjoy a curly fry, so this was right up my alley!  

I will definitely be trying more and more as time goes on!  And my husband already wants more for tonight.  Who am I to argue?! ;)",14/01/13,166,4,2,5,45,7.247399999999999,5.679000000000001,0.18,17.141,No,1390

Tonight, my opinion changed, and not for the better.  We ordered a big order and I got a gyro.  In the past, their gyro was always stuffed with meat to the point where it wasn&#39;t even foldable.  You&#39;d need to eat a bunch of meat before even attempting to pick it up.  

Tonight&#39;s sandwich was laughable.  There was literally 8 or 9 slices of meat on it.  I actually laughed out loud at the amount of meat.  Calling places like this to complain does no good.  First, they give you a canned apology that they don&#39;t mean, then they offer to bring you another sandwich that they probably spit on.  The driver is surly because he&#39;s not getting two tips from you and he probably spits on it too.

Their slices are a great value (i.e., huge and filling) and are representative of their double dough pizza. If you are not a fan of double dough pizza, please know that they also make a delicious thin crust pizza (and nice pan and stuffed pizzas). Although Bartlett has some tough competition in the pizzeria market, Sir Nick&#39;s always stands out as a great option. The one particularly unique pizza offering that they have is the Gyros pizza, which is absolutely delicious on a thin crust or double dough pizza.

For sandwiches, the Italian Beef, Gyros, and Maxwell Polish all offer great value for the money, but I would recommend getting The Chief grinder sandwich -- Italian Beef and broiled cheese on toasted garlic French bread -- if you want something really special for lunch (or dinner).

I made the unfortunate mistake of not ordering this Award winning pizza and ordered and appetizer of Spinach &amp; Artichoke dip as an appetizer and the Linguini with Spinach and Artichoke (looking back it&#39;s a monotonous order) the Dip was underwhelming and had a funky taste I just could not place, the homemade chips stuck together covered in grease and were not crispy. The Linguini had obvious canned or frozen spinach and canned artichokes. The flavor was awful, honestly is not that hard to blanch fresh spinach, the canned artichoke I will give them a pass on. I had no more than 2 bites of my meal and couldn&#39;t stomach any more.
Again, my biggest regret is not ordering that delicious smelling pizza. 

UPDATE: Sunday 9/4 my Dad wanted to visit Pal Joeys, so my son and I joined him. Waiting for service and sipping on the nasty Batavia sink tap water I realized I had made yet another mistake.
My Dad made an order of pasta, my step mom a sandwich and my son ordered cheese sticks. I decided not to make an order. 
An hour goes by, no food. We flag down our waitress and she quickly snaps that they are short staffed and quickly pointed out the table next to us was waiting for their food too, I should add that other table had been there no more than 20 minutes, they also received their food before we did. The food was run to us by a food runner at which point he notes my sons cheese sticks were not entered into our order and it should be ready shortly. At this point I am convinced our waitress forgot to enter our whole order, considering we waited nearly an hour and a half for cheese sticks, a sandwich and some pasta.

It is absolutely charming and the perfect way to dine outside on a warm summer evening.  Lots of shade too if you are there during lunch on a sunny, hot day. 

If you are a fan of pan pizza (true pan, not stuffed, not deep dish) their version is good.  It reminds me of Connie&#39;s circa 1980&#39;s when they had good pizza.

You can&#39;t go wrong with any of their pasta dishes and they very nicely accommodate special requests.  My fav pasta dish is with shrimp and broccoli.

Dinner was a burger that wasn&#39;t anything Wow!-worthy, but it was well-priced, large, and tasty. I&#39;d order it again. My wife had pasta that she said was only average and would probably not choose that dish again.

Lunch, however, has always been their pizza (they also have a pizza and salad buffet from 11-2pm). Their pizza isn&#39;t quite thick crust, but it isn&#39;t thin, either. It&#39;s nice and crispy on the outside, chewy and good on the inside. The sauce is tangy, just the right mix of sweet and acidic. The toppings are average.

The food was good - nothing stunning, but good - tried the buffalo wrap, spaghetti carbonara and cheese pizza - all were pretty decent, and given the ambiance it&#39;s definitely someplace we&#39;d come again. 

The only real complaint (and why this wasn&#39;t a 4-star review) is that the place wasn&#39;t that busy but the service was pretty slow. 38 minutes for lunch after a 15-min wait to order and another 12 mins after we requested the check. Our server was great, very nice, but perhaps a bit overworked. Actually, everyone we encountered here was terrific - very friendly and accommodating. 

It wouldn&#39;t be my first choice for a repeat lunch, but would definitely come back. Would love to try some apps and cocktails here one evening when not rushing to get back out onto the trails.

The pan pizza was good and was their only saving grace but even that had to be sent back before it was right. 

1. Do not order water , bad bad bad! So bad even my six year old commented. Mentioned to server and she said it was tap water, &#34;people get used to their filtered water and thinks ours tastes like crap&#34;. TIP - filter you water or offer bottled water.

2. It was a slow Saturday night, staff standing around, lots is bus boys not a lot of servers. The service was SLOW!

3. We ordered a super thin and a pan pizza. The pan pizza was warm, not hot. Despite being straight from the kitchen we were able to actually pick up and hold in our bare hands. Called over our server, showed her how cool it was and she said sorry I&#39;ll have them put it back in the oven. 10 mins later the same pizza made its way back out albeit much hotter this time. 

The pan pizza was good and worthy of 4 star review if there was nothing else to consider. 

4. On the way out we passed a series of self indulged high school and college aged staff, not one good night, thank you, see you again, nothing.. They seemed like they didn&#39;t care for the customers and just wanted to hang out and have fun.  Where is the management in this place?

My wife and I were seated in a room with 2 large parties even though there were tables in a quieter section, with a view of the river, where other couples and parties of 4 were seated, this started our disappointing visit. We ordered the chicken finger appetizer that was barely edible because of being overcooked, almost black! We would have complained but our waitress never returned to check on us or to refill our drinks, she was very busy with one of the large parties. When we finally got our iced tea refills they were HORRIBLE, tasted like coffee grounds mixed with muddy water! One sip was all that took to figure out so another long, thirsty delay until we could get new drinks (Coke). We unfortunately both ordered pasta which is clearly not this restaurants strong suit even though they assign a moderate price to them. The dishes were uninspired and bland.

Lunch is really average, erratic service. Dinner is better. Come here for the location not the food. Their chopped salad is the worst fyi. Been dumb enuf to order it twice, doh.
----------
I&#39;m still not a big fan of their pan pizza but it does look better than it used to, particularly the deeper dish but it&#39;s really just another inch of bread tacked on, meh.

The good news is it is still a gorgeous river accessible property with a better menu than they had 3 years ago. And our luck continued as our threesome got the SAME great server Jaqueline we had 3 years ago. We went with Jaqueline&#39;s recommendation for the way better than average supernachos with chorizo sausage, yes the meatloaf plate, the egg parmesan and the chopped salad. The meatloaf was surprisingly light and a large order with some subtle spices and a little heat plus mashed potatoes and green peas, real road food. The Eggplant parmesan was half a plate of a small order of egg plant parmesan and a larger half with spaghetti and sauce. A little disappointed in the size of the eggplant parmesan order but it was very good, and the pasta sauce at least not overly sweet. The chopped salad was kind of average but as described and refreshing. 
VERY reasonably priced for dinner and live music, no extra charge for the beautiful full moon. Seems like there is more of a Latin influence to the food than last time, Jose&#39;s Meatloaf for example, and we liked it. Very reasonably priced wine and drinks. Friendly staff.

Lots of seating choices inside and outside that include many levels and stairs particularly if you are going outside. If you have someone with limited mobility, plan ahead.

They had no complaints about what they ordered.  However, my dish was rather unsatisfactory.  The linguini tasted as if it had been prepared in a pot that had previously prepared a seafood dish.  The description for my dish was that it would be &#34;sauteed in olive oil and garlic&#34;.  If there was a garlic taste present, it was overpowered by the &#34;seafood&#34; taste.

Batavia has made some great updates to their downtown area, so my boyfriend and I decided to check things out.  We walked around town and bit and decided to have dinner at Pal Joey&#39;s.  

We sat out on the patio area because it was such a nice night.  We were seated at a table right next to the fence on the south side of the patio.  The fence was covered in spider webs and bugs . . . so yeah, gross.  I realize it&#39;s a patio and it&#39;s right next to the river, but it looked like the webs had been there for a long time.  If you&#39;re going to seat people there, at least hose down the fence so the patrons don&#39;t feel creepy crawly all through dinner.

We ordered spinach and artichoke dip.  This is one of my favorite appetizers and so easy to make.  I&#39;m not sure what Pal Joey&#39;s uses in their recipe, but I was not a fan and neither was my boyfriend. The dip was light on spinach and artichokes and heavy on lumpy, gritty cheese.  We made an effort to eat it, but just couldn&#39;t.  It wasn&#39;t good.  Our waitress was very apologetic and offered us a free dessert in its place.

Had the Joey antipasto salad, fried zucchini and small pizza (for two). The fried zucchini didn&#39;t have much flavor/spice and I&#39;m not for dipped in ranch sauce for flavor.  I liked the breaking on it though. The antipasto sealed was ok, wish places would use lettuce better than tasteless iceberg. The homemade balsamic vinaigrette was good.

What will surprise you is that I was seated with my family for over 15 minutes and yes never got the simple greeting of a waitress or waiter nor asked for even our drink order or given water.
On a Saturday night at 6:30, I expect a little more, actually a lot more, hospitality from a so called Batavia staple. We witnessed over 6 staff members waltzing about looking not enthused to the slightest. Even a few waiters stood at the small staircase, watched us get seated at a table next to two large groups and still did nothing.
Needless to say we perused the menu and waited patiently giving the teenagers the benefit of the doubt that one will come along and say hello but that did not happen. So we gathered our jackets and walked out without even being noticed.

The location is right along the Fox in downtown Batavia. The space is an old Charlie&#39;s Fox location. There is great outdoor seating right along the river, and the restaurant is a good size with plenty of seating.

I can&#39;t really report on the food because I didn&#39;t have any, but it sure looked good. I&#39;ve been to Pal Joey&#39;s in West Chicago, and it looks like they cook the pizzas the exact same way (Pan is PJs specialty). I will say that dining in at Pal Joey&#39;s always seems to be better than carryout, though.

Which is not to say this is a bad place. But I found it ... average.

I met up with a friend and her husband here on a Thursday evening. We were seated immediately on the patio and waited on pretty promptly. The menu is pizza, pasta, salads, a few meat entrees and some sandwiches. It&#39;s also a bar, but the beer list is totally boring and mainstream. 

We started with red pepper bruschetta. Not really what we were expecting -- and a bit awkward to eat, since it was a folded piece of garlic bread with red pepper and shaved cheese on top. Tasty, but not easy to share. Maybe they could cut it into six or so pieces? Dice the red pepper up? That would help.

I got the turkey club, which was a large sandwich. Grilled wheat bread, turkey, lettuce, tomato, mayo and bacon. The bacon was nice and crispy. The turkey was standard deli stuff. Pretty good, nothing special about it. The fries were boring crinkle-cut frozen and tasted greasy (old oil?). 

Our server was friendly and competent and we got good refill attention from the bus boys as well. 

If I were in Batavia again, I&#39;d come back if someone else wanted to -- especially in nice weather for the patio. But I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way.

This is in the old Charlie Fox&#39;s location.

Anyway, I was highly disappointed.  I don&#39;t know if this was a bad Saturday night, or what, but #1, it took forever to get seated.  I get that it&#39;s a Saturday night, so I do have some level of understanding, but waiting 45 minutes or so, with two young kids on the verge of meltdown mode, just doesn&#39;t work.  #2, The poor young waitress we had, was getting blasted on all accounts from several other patrons that were also receiving poor service.  Food was taking forever, food was coming out cold (as did my Wife&#39;s), and one customer was &#34;aggressively agitated&#34;.  As I said, my Wife&#39;s food came out cold, but she wasn&#39;t about to send it back otherwise we&#39;d have never gotten out of there.  My pizza, wasn&#39;t what I fondly recall Pal Joey&#39;s pizza to be.  It was on par with the pizza you have to endure at Chuckie Cheese&#39;s when you have to take the kids there for a B-Day party.  #3 as previously reviewed, once you&#39;re done, waiting for your check is the next hurdle.

I did truly feel bad for the waitress.  It CLEARLY wasn&#39;t her fault.  So I tried to be as nice and understanding with her as possible.  No point in taking out our frustrations with her like the other patron did.   So yes, I was a little let down.",28/10/14,165,2,1,0,-19,-0.5760000000000001,1.749,1.768,12.483,No,1539
pal-joeys-restaurant-and-bar-batavia,Doug C.,JmaBAR0jOTaKcKhSzUh-ow,hqmgJRVu2FaHBP_bTJcHEQ,"We had my sons birthday dinner here and this certainly is not the Pal Joey&#39;s I remember from childhood.  We ordered appetizers first, which consisted of calamari, cheese sticks and chicken fingers.  The calamari was very bland, over coated with tasteless batter and over cooked.  The chicken fingers suffered the same fate.  I can&#39;t speak on the taste of the cheese sticks but they looked unhappy and burnt.

My daughter and I ordered the Chicken Napolitano.  As an opener she ordered the Pasta Fagioli which tasted (and looked) like bland bean soup.  We looked at each other with the understanding that more disappointment was just around the corner.  It was.

Our chicken came out.  The spices they used were odd to put it kindly.  Or perhaps the overheating caused them to fuse into being something...different.  The chicken was bone dry and still had a funny taste even without these strange spices touching them.  

My wife ordered the Chicken Marsala.  This had a strange sweet kind of sauce that didn&#39;t resemble anything close to what Marsala Chicken should be.  It wasn&#39;t good.  Frankly I feel bad that three innocent chickens had to lose their lives to create this unholy trinity of bad taste and incineration.

The pizza was merely OK.  I&#39;ve had worse, but I&#39;ve also had much better.  It helped get the taste of the rest of the food out my mouth.  The waitress was pleasant and helpful, but looked a little dejected serving us the non-pizza dishes.  She knew there was a food sadist lurking in the kitchen  She knew.

However, the food was so good I can forgive that we had to wait longer than previously told. All other times since the service time has been great and we got right in.

My reason for writing this review is actually to comment on the outdoor seating area.  First thing I noticed when we were brought to our table was how many spider webs there were all over the place.  And where there are webs...  When I sat down, I noticed two dead spiders hanging from a web right under my spot at the table.  I looked up at the inside of the umbrella and saw nothing but webs &amp; dead bugs.  While we were waiting to order, a big spider crawled across my friend&#39;s menu.  While we were waiting for our food, I noticed out of the corner of my eye a spider dropping down right next to me from the umbrella.  And later, when I raised my sandwich to my mouth, I saw a spider crawling across my hand.  This is an outdoor area -- I get it.  But that is gross.  Someone should be out on that patio every morning with a broom and a hose.  I guarantee you the webs hanging all over the place had been there for a while -- which, to me, is inexcusable.  The front entrance area was just as bad.  All the plastic patio chairs were covered in webs, as were the railings.

It has always been a great location to view the river if you can ignore the bugs and the smell. But every place that seems to establish service has always been poor. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s cursed or if the waitstaff gets to tired from running around it&#39;s large square footage area. Now I&#39;ve been to their location in West Chicago but this has a little different ambiance to it. I had their baked clams and the usual sausage thin crust pizza which I was impressed by.

While this restaurant has good food, it is not Bicyclist friendly anymore, like its predecessor, &#34;Fox on the River&#34;.    The reason this is annoying is because the &#34;Fox River Trail&#34; runs right next to this restaurant; in fact, it is an arm&#39;s length away from trail.   The new owners removed the bicycle rack from the outside patio and locked the outside patio entrance.   Instead, the bicycle rack was pushed into a tight corner near the main entrance where you cannot use it anyway.   On our previous visit on 09/26/2012, the restaurant recently opened with new name and ownership, and the outside patio entrance was locked, but the bicycle rack was available at main entrance.   It was chilly that day so that made sense, but then we got a strange look by one of the workers when we sat down with our bicycle attire.  That alone should have been a warning to bicyclists.   But, now with the warmer weather, it has gotten worse.   Therefore, I am lowering my rating.   We drive a long way to use the &#34;trail&#34;, and the &#34;restaurant&#34; was just a &#34;nice to visit&#34;, and if the new owners do not welcome bicyclists, the bicyclists will just spend their money somewhere else.

We were looking for a ramp and found it but there were employees taking their smoke breaks towards the bottom so we decided to carry our stroller down the stairs to the entrance..... The host who greeted us was very nice and welcoming.  He informed us that it&#39;s a 20 minute wait which was fine.  After 40 minutes we were sat at a table inside.  I have been in this industry for over 15 years and after noticing some of the management practices tells me their experience is lacking.  The manager was counting the number of guests or tables each server had.....not exactly a bad thing because you want to make sure your guests receive the proper attention.  But they executed this rather poorly because there were several tables that were empty and had remained this way the entire evening.  There was also a dining area behind the host stand with about 8 tables that had server manuals, to go materials, and staff personal items in it.  When there are 7-8 parties waiting for a table on a gorgeous friday night and all these open tables I would say they need more servers on staff. 
Our table ordered nachos as an app and they were fantastic.  As for our server, she was very friendly and suggestive.  She stopped by the table periodically and was not at all intrusive.  If this were solely based on her, she would receive 4.5 stars.  Well done.  As for the signature thin crust, this was something I certainly wouldn&#39;t order again OR recommend to anyone wanting good pizza.  When I order thin crust I expect it to be crispy.....this was anything but.  I had to use my fork to eat it because it was so flimsy.  The bottom of the pizza pan was filled with grease.  I was still hungry but couldn&#39;t eat anymore because it just was not good.  I usually enjoy cold pizza leftovers in the morning but I didn&#39;t take them because I couldn&#39;t bare the thought of having to eat another bite.

We went there on a Wednesday night around 6:30 pm on a nice night and the place was not very busy.  We only ordered pop and water to drink, so I cannot comment on the alcoholic drinks.  The water was average and the coke was a little flat.  We split the Chicken Napalitano which was a little dry.  It came with roasted potatoes which had a decent flavor but were also a little undercooked, meaning they were kinda solid in the middle, and they were cut into wedges.  The kids each had an order of chicken fingers and fries.  The fries were average crinkle cuts and the tenders were awful.  No flavor whatsoever.  Just a coating and chicken.  The kids only ate them after they were smothered in ketchup.  We sat outside by the river, which was nice, but you almost would have to bring bug spray for mosquito&#39;s, I got bit a few times and wanted to leave early.  Also, the outside patio bathrooms are something you would find in a crappy, hole in the wall bar.  Dirty, not clean, and the large toilet paper roll was sitting on top of the holder and not in the holder.  That went for the paper towel roll.  It was just nasty, and I had to take my 3yr old daughter in there.  The place also charged us for splitting the dinner.  They added a $1.50 for a split plate..... Uhh, I would have just had you bring me a separate plate and cut it myself.  Are you kidding me...  For $40 dollars, &#34;without alcohol&#34;, I didn&#39;t feel it was worth it.

china-wok-pingree-grove,Chris F.,55j1SIT6pL0u8FRN8IRUWA,ra6bmty8nXQv1SMIU5uGuA,"A friend told me this place opened up and that the food was good. For some crazy reason I stopped in and ordered take out... so glad I did. Actually surprised how good the food really is. Chinese food is in my top 4 all time foods, but this place does something different. Their food has more flavor than what I am used to. That is a good thing. Very very flavorful, as if some kind of essence to the food. It smells good and tastes as good as it smells. Best part is from what I read on their website, they do not use MSG, thank God. I am giving it a high rating because I can&#39;t remember when I have ever tasted Chinese food as flavorful as this. I had the triple delight and the orange beef over white rice. This is now my place of choice.",10/02/14,82,5,2,5,29,4.2761,2.716,0.33599999999999997,8.948,No,745

Second time here, and I have to say I&#39;m a fan! The food is hot and good. Today&#39;s Chicken &amp; Broccoli with white rice and egg roll was great (lunch special for $5.75).
