I wish I came here earlier -- the concept is pretty much fast-casual, where you pick your base (noodles or rice) and your proteins and toppings. I like places like this because they have a really good nutrition calculator online so if you&#39;re health-conscious like me, you can always look up what you&#39;re getting. I got the Pork &amp; Chicken Meatballs with thai chilli sauce. It was absolutely phenomenal. The staff there were super nice and explained everything, considering it was my first time there.

It was a nice change in flavor - I made my own bowl and got half meatballs/half chicken over brown rice, with green beans, red curry, crispy garlic and herbs.   The curry was definitely fairly spicy. My friend got the shophouse bowl which had green curry - also delicious. We tried the spring rolls which were pretty good as well.

Obviously not &#34;authentic&#34; southeast Asian food, because you kind of get to create your own thing but with ingredients that could be found in SEA food.

A pair of freebie lunch cards were burning a hole in my wallet, so I had no qualms about cashing these in on the last Sunday in July.

For the longest time, I always thought of these guys as the &#34;Asian Chipotle&#34;.  So it made all too much sense when I learned that ShopHouse&#39;s parent company is, in fact, Chipotle.  The build-your-own food format is the same, the look and feel of the restaurant&#39;s interior is similar, even the friendly staff are on-par with those at the Mexican variant.

The vouchers -- from an Elite event back in mid-February, hey hey! -- were good for a free bowl of whatever.  So we worked our way down the line and built our entrÌ©es as we saw fit.  Neither LeAnn P nor myself found the chilled rice noodles to be an appealing &#39;base&#39;, so she got brown rice instead.

I went with the steak laab, which wasn&#39;t a great choice, as I wound up eating literally everything except the meat, which was coated with something unexplainable and crunchy (toasted rice?)  Meat shouldn&#39;t be crunchy.  Like ever.  Maybe next time I&#39;ll remember my mistake and opt for the meatballs instead.

All the others toppings and accoutrements were great; even the red curry tasted fine with the roasted green beans and pickled vegetables.  LP enjoyed her selection more than I did mine.  Their mango-coconut mini dessert was just as adorable (and tasty!) as I remember from a previous visit.

I was more than a little bummed that their beer on tap (Daisy Cutter, a personal favorite) couldn&#39;t be served to me, because no employee working there was over 21!  State laws are all fine and good, but when daddy can&#39;t get his 3pm drink on, sh*t doesn&#39;t bode well.

Fortunately, we got comped not only a bottled ginger ale and a fountain beverage, but ALSO one of the mango-coconut rice parfaits for the inconvenience of being denied alcohol.  That was nice of them (and frankly, the act of generosity saved their butts a star).

Bread = 3.5
Circuses = 4

Their wall of Sriracha is a saucy sight to behold (teehee), and the dining area was kept clean of any garbage.  Employees were chill.

shophouse-southeast-asian-kitchen-schaumburg,Jacqueline B.,zKY6NM9CxxWxcY5JJXUB7g,4IwdX7CJx_UM8OtqgRrwLg,"A-OK Shophouse! Fast casual is always a win in my book and this place does a great job.

Service is fast, friendly, and helpful. ShopHouse is owned by Chipotle so their concept is similar. They offer a menu you can select from or you can create your own bowl. It&#39;s southeast Asian cuisine, which is new to me but it&#39;s pretty good.

My first go around I went with their spicy noodle bowl because I love spicy foods. I must warn you (just like I was warned), this spice is no joke! The flavor was great, but it was a heat where you either had to just keep eating or drink a lot on between bites! Honestly, too hot for me.

Second time around I got smart and decided to create my own bowl. That way if it was too spicy I only had myself to blame right? Right. Well I ended up avoiding the heat all together and went with a peanut sauce, but my combo was very good: jasmine rice, chicken, beef, pickled veggies, slaw, garlic, peanut and vinegar sauce.

I love that their meals come with a spring roll. If you&#39;re ever thinking about getting dessert, do! They offer a coconut parfait that is delicious.

Overall a good fast casual restaurant. Friendly service, reasonable prices, and a great location. It&#39;s to be noted that they offer beer as well. ShopHouse is nothing I&#39;d go out of my way for, but if I&#39;m in the area it&#39;s a nice quick food option.",10/06/16,170,3,3,5,67,9.097599999999998,5.6129999999999995,0.428,14.959,No,1371
shophouse-southeast-asian-kitchen-schaumburg,Nicole W.,qlC607Cyp0Mj91vDFvkp3Q,LhwMbpUWiV0NjDKX0aw8aw,"ShopHouse was a fine, quick casual lunch. It wasn&#39;t remarkable, it wasn&#39;t subpar, it was just *fine.* 

The service was quick and friendly and I love me a fast casual restaurant. The space itself is on the smaller side but lends itself well in location and concept for plenty of hungry Schaumburgers (is that a word?) seeking a fast Asian inspired lunch. 

The options, just like its parent company Chipotle, are fairly limited. I choose with the peanut chicken rice bowl - I&#39;m a sucker for peanut sauce anything. The bowl itself wasn&#39;t overly stuffed and while I definitely had enough food and more, don&#39;t expect gargantuan portions that you&#39;ve witnessed at Chipotle. While the items in the bowl tasted pretty fresh, there wasn&#39;t much pizazz and the peanut sauce wasn&#39;t overly flavorful. 

Schaumburg has its fair share of both fast casual and fantastic Asian cuisine. While ShopHouse is a fine addition that broaches these too categories, there are plenty of fast casual and Asian eats that do a much better job on the flavor scale.",18/05/16,115,3,2,4,49,3.8760999999999997,2.786,0.608,7.607000000000001,No,1066

In short: 
IMO the flavors are SUPER MILD (fyi, my threshold is &#34;mild-to-moderate&#34; heat).

If you want a dish with ANY spice, I suggest the Red Curry sauce, PLUS get the chilies on the side!

_____________________________________________

Bowl #1 w/Tamarind sauce:

chilled rice noodles, chicken satay, squash with Thai basil, green papaya/cucumber slaw, Tamarind sauce, and crispy garlic.

Verdict: 3/5

Holy minescule amount of chicken! The bowl was VERY noodle-heavy without enough chicken to balance it out.

The Tamarind sauce lent a very light, somewhat tangy flavor. I couldn&#39;t taste the garlic.

Spice? What spice???
NONE of the ingredients contributed even a minescule amount of heat.

The ONLY plus is that the bowl is so &#34;light&#34; that I ate the whole thing - before a pilates class, no less - without feeling like a glutton.
____________________________________________

Bowl #2 w/Green Curry sauce:

brown rice, steak, green beans, green curry sauce, pickled veggies, fresh chilies on the side (exceptttt they gave me this green stuff - not the pretty red chilies showcased in everyone else&#39;s pics..)

Verdict: 4/5

There was more meat this time, so the bowl was FAR more balanced than my first.  I liked the flavor of the steak - both that and the beans were lightly charred, but no &#34;burnt&#34; taste at all.  

Flavor-wise, it was fine, but had hardly ANY spice.  The green curry lent a VERY mild heat; anyone who likes even a remote amount of spice will want to add the chilies or Sriracha. I added the green chilies and it was soo much better!
_____________________________________________

Bowl #3 w/Red Curry sauce:

brown rice, steak, green beans, squash, red curry sauce, pickled veggies, and Herb salad, w/ green chilies on the side.

Verdict: 4/5

MUCH better flavor-wise! The heat was still on the milder side, so I&#39;m thankful I asked for those chilies again! This was my most balanced and generous bowl ingredients-wise. 


Soooo, during this bowl creation, I asked for pickled veggies and the worker accidentally put on papaya slaw. No biggie: I asked if she could just remove the slaw from the top and replace with the vegs. She said &#34;Ok,&#34; but the next thing I knew, she TOSSED the WHOLE BOWL in the GARBAGE and started a new one! WTH?! Apparently she was TOLD to THROW OUT THE ENTIRE BOWL!  Why?! If I had known before she pitched it, I would have just taken it. So wasteful!  Sheesh.

Service: 5/5

Other:
I&#39;m a fan of their compostable containers. Make sure you transfer those leftovers to another container, though, because otherwise things get leaky.


Overall impression? 
Shophouse is the perfect example of a 3.5-star rating. It&#39;s a nice addition to healthier assembly-line fast food, but the scrimping on ingredients (and $1+ charges for additional veggies) will keep me heading back...

It all sounds good on paper, but like the 2016 Chicago Bulls, it doesn&#39;t necessarily have the right chemistry. Shophouse says its food is influenced by SouthEast Asian cuisine, specifically Thai and Vietnamese.

I had the Shophouse Bowl, which had pork and chicken meatballs on top of jasmine rice covered in a green curry with roasted corn. The pickled vegetables (sliced carrots, radish) definitely come from the Vietnamese side while the curry is Thai. The meatballs were definitely a Chipotle Mexican Asian fusion.

While the mashup of ingredients tasted fine, I couldn&#39;t help but desire authentic Vietnamese or Thai. There just wasn&#39;t enough curry to cover the rice, and the meatballs were... well they were okay.

Warning for those that are sensitive to spicy dishes - Neely everything has a healthy amount of heat to it. I&#39;m someone who can handle the spiciest kimchi chigae, so I&#39;m no wimp.

Service was fast, friendly, and it seems all the lines have moved from Chipotle to Shophouse, at least during lunch.

Unfortunately, my stomach later regretted my choice of food. You can say that the empire struck back. Ugh. I think I&#39;ll hit up my local hole in the walls for the real deal and skip the regret my body felt from fusion confusion.",01/04/16,167,2,2,1,24,0.2093999999999996,1.691,2.509,12.8,No,1440

You get to pick what you want in a food assembly line like Chipotle but the food being offered are more Asian Fusion. It is a unique taste and very convenient for a quick food stop/lunch break. However, I am not a fan of the Americanized take to these Asian dishes. It is very healthy and I can tell that all the ingredients are made fresh, but it&#39;s just not like typical authentic Asian dishes that I am familiar with.

So you get to pick a base (white rice, brown rice, noodles, or salad); a type of meat (chicken, laab, pork &amp; chicken meatballs, and tofu); vegetables (broccoli, corn, squash, &amp; green beans); sauces (various curry sauces, peanut sauce, and tamarind sauce); and then garnishes. 

Overall, you can be very creative and add whatever your heart desires but if you&#39;re not sure what taste good with what, you can always play it safe and order a pre-made bowl. 

This location also serves beer and ginger ale sodas that are really yummy!

Immediately after landing our plan was to head over and give this Chipotle owned chain a try. What is great about this place was that it is actually 100% gluten free and dairy free! Perfect for me who has celiac disease and a dairy allergy, I can have literally everything on the menu! For our bases we got rice and salad. For the meat option I chose half meatballs and half tofu. For veggies I went with the squash and the broccoli and for the sauce knowing me I went with some of the spiciest and some of the vinaigrette. Then I finished off my bowl with all the topping options.

We ended up getting sodas and two of the mango rice dessert cups.
Now for what I liked, I really enjoyed the meatballs they had great flavor. The entire bowl was quite tasty and really flavorful. The mango rice dessert was very small but also just the perfect ending to our meal.

The problems I had were just basically one thing and that was how spicy the meal was. I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be so hot. What did it for my bowl I think was the Thai chiles on top which just made the entire bowl flaming. I had to have a full drink next to me the entire time.

Overall though I really did enjoy the bowl and am definitely hoping for one to show up in the San Francisco Bay Area. The employees were so friendly and willing to answer any questions I had.

I feel partly responsible for bringing this disaster to us. Sorry guys. I love Asian food and I love Chipotle so I figured this would be a success. Not so much. The flavors aren&#39;t down pat. They aren&#39;t Asian.. They aren&#39;t even tasty Americanized Asian flavors. They&#39;re just meh and bland. Very bland. I highly enjoyed the pork and chicken spring rolls and if in the area, I might stop in for those.

I didn&#39;t enjoy the bowls though. I went for the Shophouse. I don&#39;t recommend it. First, it&#39;s not real curry. I&#39;ve never had curry with not even a hint of coconut milk, until I tried ShopHouse. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any coconut milk in it. The meatballs were so skimpy. I chopped them up so I had enough for my bowl, but I ended up still having half of the rice left after finishing the meatballs. In fact, I brought the leftover rice home and made chicken sausage and STILL had more left. If you adore rice, then this might be a good concept for you. I mean I like rice, but damn.  My husband got steak laab with rice and green curry. I liked his steak a lot and there was plenty of it in the bowl, but again the curry. BLAH. He also had the charred green beans, which I liked.

Also, why are you being so effing skimpy on the veggies? Most businesses will over-veggie you (I definitely understand skimping on the protein, but why are you skimping on the slaw?) They use tweezers to put certain things on your bowl, so expect two pieces of &#34;salad&#34; on top of your bowl. As with new businesses, I&#39;d say &#34;oh they just need to perfect things&#34; but this was not the case. 

We came here on date night and it was so off putting that an employee was on break talking about marijuana the whole time. The entire time.

It&#39;s basically a Vietnamese/Tai version of Chipotle. 
When we arrived, the friendly fellow behind the counter asked if this is our first time here. When we said it was, he explained how everything works in a very hospitable kind of way. 
When I asked if they have MSG in any of the food or sauces, he double-checked with the manager, a kind and knowing young woman, who assured me that they don&#39;t and insisted that their food is the same quality as their flagship restaurant.

The most positive thing I can start with is the customer service and the patience and smiles that came from the staff. The crew here is definitely well trained and knowledgeable about the menu and options. The manager even swapped my son&#39;s chicken when he found it to be too bitter from the charring.

My son really enjoyed the meatballs, which I found to be the second best thing about ShopHouse.

Aside from that, the food was average to good at best. I found it lacking in flavors except for the really strong bitterness of the charred beans and corn.

My take is that Chipotle wowed is with its simplicity, freshness, and familiar flavors. ShopHouse broke from this concept by taking a risk with strong (traditional?) burnt flavors and departing from the conservative palettes of its loyal Chipotle demographic.

I want ShopHouse to do well, but I will likely wait for some menu updates before returning. I wish the marketing lived up to my expectations.",28/11/15,114,2,3,5,62,5.139600000000001,3.3880000000000003,0.7709999999999999,8.841,No,1084

I overheard the manager answer a few questions to the people in front of me and he seemed very patient as he explained the process of how to order and what he recommended to get. A+ for customer service!

I actually really enjoyed my food. I got the chicken bowl with brown rice, green beans,papaya salad,and red curry sauce. The green bean was charred and although I love the grilled taste, I dont think it&#39;s very good for the body to get it frequently (carinogens and all). The papaya salad was a great addition to my bowl and I would definitely get it again. The red curry sauce was incredibly spicy, just FYI for people who can&#39;t handle it. I also bought a mango coconut rice parfait which i really enjoyed as a snack later in the day. 

The only thing I wish they would change is being more generous with the toppings. I guess I&#39;m spoiled from Chipotle since they seem to put a good amount of toppings to give me my money&#39;s worth. Shophouse seemed to be a little more stingy. I don&#39;t like how we are limited to only one type of vegetable. They don&#39;t seem to give that much in the first place, so being able to put more than 1 type of veggie would be preferred.

I came here with the specific intent of testing just how spicy I could go (in other words, is it an American 4 flames, or an Asian 4 flames?)

The short answer is that 4 flames = 3.5 / 10 for me (a nice medium heat). 

The long answer is that the more things you pile into your plate, the better things get. I started out with the tofu, which looked like... Chipotle&#39;s sofritas. I was open to the interpretation, though, and was rewarded with decent texture and good 1-flame flavor. That&#39;s when things got fun. 

I piled on 4-flame charred green beans, which were tender, incredibly flavorful, and contributed nice heat. After sampling tamarind vinaigrette and peanut sauce, I asked for 2-flame green curry. On went the papaya slaw, the pickled vegetables, and &#34;herb salad&#34; that is pretty much just cilantro. On went toasted rice, crispy garlic and crushed peanuts. (I refrained on the Thai chilies for today). 

All this was served over a heaping bowl of brown rice, which was perfectly cooked. There was a great combination of different kinds of heat, crunchiness and vibrant freshness stirring about in the bowl, and I was very happy indeed. 

Two major knocks: first, they didn&#39;t have any chopsticks, which is a cardinal sin that needs to be rectified immediately. 

Second, if you step off of the narrow path I carved, things get bland in a hurry. My wife got brown rice, peanut sauce and meatballs. The peanut sauce was all right, but nothing else contributed flavor. I added some Sriracha to what she couldn&#39;t finish. I added more Sriracha. It still didn&#39;t come together. 

One decently major knock: only one vegetable? Brightwok Kitchen downtown gives me four, and they do it really well. If it stays this stingy, given the choice I&#39;d probably be more likely to go there on a given day. 

Finally, some sort of a sour sauce on the wall with the Sriracha would be great. 

Anyway, if you come in here and say &#34;the peanut sauce is too spicy&#34; like I heard someone older say when I was there, you&#39;ll be set for disappointment. But if you&#39;re prepared to roam the menu like a bull in a china shop, you&#39;ll be in for some well-cooked East Asian food.",22/11/15,279,4,1,5,6,5.1966,3.1339999999999995,0.676,23.19,No,2249

And I was not disappointed. The setup is similar to Chipotle (as to be expected) and there are many choices for rice/noodles, protein, veggies, and other toppings. I ended up going with the ShopHouse bowl with a little tofu on the side. The bowl was amazing! A perfect bend of flavors topped with cilantro. I had a Jasmine tea ginger ale which was totally worth it. Additionally, I tried the rice pudding/mango dessert. For $1.90, it&#39;s worth the pocket change. 

Bonus points for having a vertical and horizontal (more upside down &#34;L&#34; shaped) glass in front of the line. Because it&#39;s a total pet peeve of mine when people peer over the glass and point or hang their DNA over the food on the line. So bonus points for having some protection from that.

I think they should have a tofu option that is truly vegetarian (it is soaked in fish sauce and therefore not an option for non-meateaters). Otherwise, no complaints!

Essentially ShopHouse is kind of carryout, quick serve, Vietnamese restaurant built on the Chipotle approach to Mexican cooking. For me, ShopHouse delivered nicely. 

I had the steak Laab and spiced it up with the spicy green beans, green curry sauce and some hot peppers. The combo worked great with no particular food drowning out the rest. 

The mango coconut pudding thing for dessert was a nice way to finish. The mixture of the fruits works great and the way it&#39;s served in a little shot glass is perfect too in terms of portion and presentation.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Chipotle but a very American gourmet southeast Asian dish is just not for me I guess. I don&#39;t get the meatball option. Sounds like a ball of unused meats fused together. It&#39;s more of like an amalgam of confused meat. IMO, the meatballs don&#39;t belong in this equation. 

Anywho, the Chipotle style of make your own meal/bowl is so passÌ© and unoriginal. Especially when you get charged for everything &#34;extra&#34; unlike their counterpart where you can load up a bowl to make a 5 pound meal until you can&#39;t even make the tortillas meet on your burrito or can&#39;t close the bowl because it is whopping with all the extras you&#39;ve managed to cram in.

This would be counted among the worst of them, both for lack of taste and lack of options.  Not a single one of the ingredients (4-5 each of meats, sauces, veggies) interested me. What I got was a totally average bowl of what might be compared to leftovers.  They didn&#39;t even have real chicken, just some chicken meatballs, which were admittedly the best thing about the meal.  But the rice, the curry, the corn, the veggies, all of it was just so... meh.

shophouse-southeast-asian-kitchen-schaumburg,Sarah S.,QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q,mEbtDW9LnUOXLOwmkVyS0Q,"I was soooooo excited for ShopHouse&#39;s opening - anxiously awaiting it&#39;s arrival and stalking the updates for several months. I went on opening day when they were giving free bowls...but sadly the line was down the block and I went somewhere else. I finally got back there yesterday to give them a go.

I&#39;m not feeling it. I tried. I wanted to. I really wanted to. But I just didn&#39;t find it delicious. I found most of the ingredients to be really random and don&#39;t mesh together quite well. I went with a pretty basic combination and thought I couldn&#39;t go wrong with various foods I liked - well, I wasn&#39;t right. While it was edible, I just didn&#39;t find it fantastic.

Jasmine Rice - The rice was cooked perfectly and the portion was generous. No complaints with my bowl base.
Pork &amp; Chicken Meatballs - Everyone loves their meatballs! I liked them just fine but didn&#39;t find them amazing. They have &#39;fresh herbs&#39; in them but silly me didn&#39;t think twice about that bit of them. Part of the fresh herbs is cilantro. I know cilantro is a huge part of Southeast Asian food...but it&#39;s one food that absolutely grosses me out. So thanks to that gross little green herb, I didn&#39;t enjoy the meatballs much.
Charred Corn - I actually liked this. I didn&#39;t love it and may have preferred just plain ol&#39; corn without the char. However, I had no issue with this. I think generally people would prefer less or no char on their corn though. And honestly no other charred veggies sounded appealing to me.
Peanut Sauce - It was okay. I didn&#39;t get the flavorful oomph I was looking for in their sauce that I had hoped would tie my whole dish together. I don&#39;t think I will get this next time and will try a different sauce. 

I&#39;m weak and found my dish to be quite spicy using the most mild ingredients offered. It wasn&#39;t overpowering though and was kind of the good type of spice flavor. Something just wasn&#39;t doing it for me with the flavors together. Maybe I picked the wrong sauce?

I wish they had more than 4 sauces. I wish they had more than 3 meat options. I wish they had better pre-decided flavor combos. I wish everything was priced $1-2 less. I wish 3 of the 6 pop options offered were working when I went in (yes half were marked out of order on day 4 of being open). 

On a positive note, they have Half Acre Daisy Cutter on tap. I only saw one draft beer and then a few others in bottles in a fridge.

Love the concept, will try them one more time (though I&#39;m in no rush), food just isn&#39;t on point though. As many before me, I hoped it would be on the Chipotle level &amp; that this could become a regular lunch spot while I&#39;m work...but nu uh.",17/11/15,303,2,3,5,88,4.183199999999999,6.169,4.098999999999999,29.732000000000003,No,2738

I tried a combination of 2 bowls I had tried previously.  A salad bowl with meatballs.  The meatballs were by far my favorite thing on the menu!  I usually like noodle bowls too, but for some reason they aren&#39;t hot noodles here, and that sort of turns me off.

The layout is very similar and you can &#34;create your own bowl&#34; or choose one of their pre-selected combos. I typically like a lot of heat in my food so I trusted them with their spicy combo--HOLY FIRE in my mouth (comparable to the Blazin&#39; Wings at Buffalo Wild Wings)! I suggest getting another tamer sauce to go with the bowl. The mango + rice dessert was pretty yummy although my friend did not enjoy it.

shophouse-southeast-asian-kitchen-schaumburg,Yvonne I.,vsRPm_-WdtcY0CWZNz2u1g,5w6EUA2s8VNqEZ8NNtEEpg,"Shop House is very different than most of the other quick serve restaurant&#39;s in the Chicagoland area. I recently went to a Yelp event here, and had a pleasure of meeting one of the corporate representatives. The corporate representative explained the background behind Shop House, and about the food itself. This was an awesome way to become more familiar with the Shop House brand.

At Shop House, you just walk up to the counter to start your meal order. You have the option of either picking your own ingredients, or selecting one of their bowl combination suggestions.   I ordered a noodle bowl with the meatballs, green beans, and peanut sauce. The noodles are chilled, but all of the other ingredients warm them up so it&#39;s barely noticeable. I was extremely  pleased with my bowl creation. I love spicy foods, and my bowl mixture was perfect for someone that loves spicy food. I did notice that most of the ingredients were described as being more on the spicy side though. Their spicy ingredients, meats, and sauces might pose a problem for customers that don&#39;t like a lot of spice. I also tried their spring rolls, and they came with this delicious dipping sauce. The actual  spring rolls were super fresh and light.

shophouse-southeast-asian-kitchen-schaumburg,Betty C.,PMhBMIpAH_wf0aAe2OOIFg,37IEzYmjx043j-gAwwBWag,"Have read all the reviews and have to say that it&#39;s fairly obvious this concept has come too early to this part of the Chicago metropolitan area. This food is just too exotic for most.

For those of you that like standard Americanized Chinese fare like sweet-and-sour pork, beef and broccoli, stirfried noodles, and sweet pad Thai etc. this is not the place for you.

Agree with several of the reviewers that said that the choices and combinations are daunting and lead to bowls being put together with flavors that may not be pleasing to those new to SE Asian cuisine. However, anyone who has been to Southeast Asia specifically Vietnam, or Cambodia etc. and has liked the cuisine they found there - and I am not talking about at westernized Asian food at hotels - those folks are going to find the flavors at Shop House Asian kitchen to be tasty and reminiscent of those they enjoyed in that part of the world although they might not be 100% &#34;authentic.&#34;

Several of the reviews seem to have been written by people that very well likely work for competitive restaurants. They have one or two reviews total to their name and give extremely little description but rant negatively and then give one star or two stars. 

Our experience for lunch on a Sunday was very pleasant. Of the eight tables that were occupied five of them were Asian families, the other three, one of them including ourselves, were non-Asians. 

The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming when we told them it was our first visit. We ordered a salad bowl with pork and chicken meatballs, thebsquash and Thai basil warm vegetable, Tamarind vinaigrette, herb salad, pickled vegetables, papaya salad, and all four of the garnishes.

The meatballs were probably not as warm as they should have been, which concerns me given Chipotle&#39;s recent problems with food safety. They should&#39;ve been a lot warmer.

The salad base, the herbs, the pickled vegetables and papaya slaw were all extremely fresh, with good crunch. The Tamarind vinaigrette was light and had just enough sweet and acid to perfectly accent the flavors of all of the ingredients we chose. 

Instead of the red Thai chili pepper garnish listed on the website today&#39;s choice was green Thai chili peppers. The relish was very hot, with a good kick of garlic and really brought together the entire bowl. 

They did not have trays and did not ask if we were eating in or taking out and put lids on all of our containers before we even paid. They were being efficient but that created waste in lids that did not need to be used.

All in all we were extremely pleased with the nutrition calculator online and the flavor of everything we tasted.

I dunno, guys. Part of me thinks this place is just experiencing new business issues, but part of me just thinks the food is not good and not worth the price.

We were so excited to try ShopHouse. We&#39;d heard of it in the news and even thought about trying it during our travels. We love Asian. We love Chipotle. How could it go wrong?

Oh, but it went wrong, so very wrong. See, unlike Mexican (tex-mex) or Italian food, Asian food seems to incorporate a lot of complex flavors that the average layman like myself does not understand. There&#39;s a lot of opportunity to fck this up if given the chance, and by laying everything out and allowing people to choose their own adventure, it&#39;s just asking for trouble. 

I decided to be safe. There are about 4 pre-selected combos you can choose from. And I figured that by choosing one of them with a few minor modifications (noodles vs. rice) I would be okay. 

Notsomuch. 

I ordered the ShopHouse bowl but with noodles. My wife ordered the spicy bowl but with noodles and chicken. Mine was just a jumble of flavors that just didn&#39;t seem to go together, and I was left with that godawful sweet and bitter charred corn being the takeaway flavor that I can&#39;t seem to shake. The noodles were cold, which is weird because there were also hot items in the bowl. It felt conflicted. And the noodles were so slimy and slippery that none of the sauce really stuck to them. 

I&#39;m usually a fan of curries, but this was just not good. Also? I agree with Courtney C. The meat to other stuff ratio just didn&#39;t do it for me. And also also? Why are the bowls so big if they only fill them about halfway up? Quantity is never an issue at Chipotle, but they were downright conservative on the portion size here. And at $20 for two for a meal, I expected to get full. 

Okay, on to a few of the new-business issues. 

1) There are no trays. My wife recently had surgery and is only one one foot right now. So I have to carry both of our entrees and drinks. The employee at the register offered to help, but really? Just get some trays, guys.

2) There was no actual can in the garbage can.

3) And this was a big one. There was no iced tea. I filled my cup about halfway and got a cup about half full of liquid and a huge pile of tea grounds floating around. I asked one of the managers to refill the tea, but by the time we finished eating it still hadn&#39;t been filled.

Since I wasn&#39;t getting a drink, I asked for a refund on it. I walked up to the register and here&#39;s where a serious customer service problem came about. They treated me like Whitley in that episode of A Different World where she goes into the jewelry store and the salesperson basically ignores her completely. 

The girl at the register totally ignored my request and helped other people in line while I stood there. She didn&#39;t say she would be right with me, she just stood there helping everyone else. I didn&#39;t even cut. They weren&#39;t actually in the line when I walked up to the counter so this was just a major customer service mishap. 

The manager who originally built my bowl (and who I asked to refill the tea) seemed to notice what was going on and quickly tried to solve the problem by handing me a bottle of fancy iced tea. It was a nice gesture, but I&#39;m afraid I still left with a bad taste in my mouth, and not just because of the burnt corn.",16/11/15,375,2,2,0,26,-0.13310000000000038,4.263,3.3900000000000006,40.346,No,3493

I originally wanted half steak and half meatballs but they were just preparing some more meatballs and the wait was too long for my liking. However, the staff brought a couple out to our table when they were ready which was awesome. They in itself were very tasty. 

I agree with many other reviewers that they went beyond charred on various ingredients. I frantically don&#39;t mind some burnt flavor but the steak was very hard to chew and nearly inedible. With the overly burnt steak and green beans, my mouth was left with a very unpleasant bitter taste for the rest of the evening. The chicken was fine. The veggie garnishes were enjoyable. I found the spicy red curry to be very lackluster and practically nonexistent. Good thing the proteins were seasoned and the garnishes provided enough flavor.

Well, this is a Chipotle for Thai/Viet food. The coke machine is even in Thai and they&#39;re playing Thai music (I think?).

You can pick from brown rice, jasmine rice, cold rice noodles, or salad. Then you can pick your meat, steak laab, pork and chicken meatballs, chicken satay, or organic tofu. Then you pick from a vegetable, spicy green beans, charred corn, or seasonal veggies (butternut squash or broccoli). Then a sauce, green curry, spice red curry, peanut sauce, or tamarind vinaigrette. Garnishes include green papaya slaw, pickled veggies, or herb salad. Toppings are crushed peanuts, toasted rice, crispy garlic, and Thai chillies.

I got, half brown rice half jasmine rice, half steak laab and half chicken, spicy green beans, spicy red curry, papaya slaw, herb salad, toasted rice, crispy garlic, and Thai chillies.

I wanted to try everything so I also got spring rolls and the coconut rice and mango parfait.

The spring rolls were just ok. I&#39;ve had better, but these were different. They had ground pork and shrimp with papaya slaw and herbs. The dipping sauce was really good. It tasted like a peanut, curry, fish sauce kinda thing.

The bowl was really good. The steak seemed overcooked, but maybe it was supposed to be like that. The chicken was very tender and juicy. I overheard one of the managers talking and he said they only use thigh meat! Yum!! I couldn&#39;t taste much of the sauce, but everything was nice. A good balance of spicy, sweet, salty, crispy, soft just like how I know Thai/Viet food to be.

The coconut rice and mango parfait was soo good! It didn&#39;t taste like there was much in it except rice, coconut milk, and mango puree. Omg. So good! And only $1.50. I&#39;m def getting it every time I come here.

The meat portion was cut small that I had to dig through my rice to find the chicken.

We went with a BOGO deal thanks to a fellow yelper, and got several more while there.  I had the cold noodles, and I wouldnt do that again.  Everything was extra watery, and the other stuff just slid off the noodles rather than blended.  I was nervous about the heat after reading other reviews, so I stuck with less spicy, but I probably could have done a little more heat.  I did like the green papaya slaw and pickled vegetables.  I also liked that you could taste the sauce before hand, so I knew I made a good choice with the green curry.  My husband got the steak, and it was literally just a bunch of char.

I am not a fast food person, but when I do need a fast fix, I always hit up Chipotle. I am very glad to have another option for healthy fast options at my leisure. They had some incredible choices, but because I could not make up my mind, I did a bunch of halves. For starters, I got 1/2 brown rice and noodles, 1/2 tofu and chicken, 1/2 corn and 1/2 green beans. I topped it off the herb salad, crispy garlic, fresh chilies, and 1/2 peanut sauce and 1/2 spicy red curry.
By now, I know you are asking what&#39;s up with all of the halves? Well, for one, to get whole portions would have been way too much food for me and for two, they charge you for anything extra, so if you do halves then you are not charged anything.
The food was great except for the chilled noodles. They tasted overcooked to me and maybe they are supposed to be that way, but at any rate, I am not a fan. I will definitely go back to Shophouse for another bowl.",22/04/16,121,4,1,3,0,2.7264000000000004,1.59,0.109,9.301,No,996

You can tell there are regulars who know exactly what they like. There isn&#39;t necessarily one &#39;right&#39; combo - it really comes down to personal taste. I think one downside is there *are* combos that don&#39;t work due to the wide variety of flavors to mix and I think this turns people off. I also think people go in expecting the flavor of Americanized Asian (lots of sweet sauce stir fried with noodles). This is NOT Shophouse. You can&#39;t go in expecting Chipotle flavors either, because that&#39;s not what this place about. Its traditional Asian cuisine.

Their chicken is very similar flavor to Chipotle and the meatballs are great. FYI- their veggies are supposed to be charred - they are NOT burned. 

I&#39;m not sure Shophouse will take off, though. It will be interesting to see. I don&#39;t find myself craving Shophouse over Chipotle. The ingredients are similar and I am worried there&#39;s not enough differentiation from Chipotle.

I had been watching ShopHouse for the past couple of months as it was being built near my work. I personally am not a big fan of Asian food or cuisine. But, when I discovered it was styled after its parent company, Chipotle (of which I am a big fan), I decided it was time to stop in and see what this &#34;Asian Chipotle&#34; was all about. They have a strong assortment of mixed Asian veggies (ie. broccoli, green beans, and squash) as well as sauces (ie. curry, peanut sauce, and vinaigrette). Pick from a couple of pre-configured dishes or mix and match (rice, noodles, and salad) as you please. It&#39;s a simple style that still manages to offer plenty of flavor and variety. All in all the food was good but could use some quick tweaks. Service was very good and the employees were friendly and should be complimented for checking up on me. Location is very clean and a nice place to hang. Depending on how they improve on my return trips they may earn four stars. Worth trying.

The Food: (Score 4/5)
I got the Vegan Bowl and an Unsweetened Tea for about $10. The bowl contained: brown rice, organic tofu, seasonal veggies, peanut sauce, pickled vegetables, herb salad, and crispy garlic. The flavors were bold, tasty, and satisfying. Unfortunately the brown rice was a little under-cooked. The grains would become a bit too crunchy distracting from the delightful tofu and veggies. I hope to return and experiment with other combinations. As a new location I expect that they&#39;re still trying to get their groove all figured out. 

I would also love to see more side options on the menu. Spring chicken or steak rolls are available. A single mango parfait is a possibility for desert. Not much else if you&#39;re looking for the munchies. Overall these aren&#39;t bad combinations, but they should definitely experiment with additional menu items. Locally sourced and organic options are present and appreciated! Decent portions for the price. However, considering the plethora of appetizing Asian cuisine locales that are available in Schaumburg, ShopHouse will be hard pressed to stand out in the crowd. 

*(Updated 7/09/2016: After multiple visits I am happy to report that their food has improved. As a result I am raising this score from a 3 to a 4.The rice and noodles are well cooked and the vegetables have a good texture. For those who have complained about flavors clashing I would recommend asking the employees for dish suggestions. They are extremely knowledgeable about dish ingredients and offer suggestions for building flavorful and complementary bowls).

The Service: (Score 4.5/5)
Friendly from start to finish. When I walked in I was warmly greeted and checked up on throughout my lengthy stay. I decided to hole up and finish some studies. The workers were kind in offering to clear my trash. They also engaged in small talk and wished me well in my studies. All around great crew!

The Location: (Score 4.5/5)
A neat, clean, and well-lit location that is perfect for lunch or dinner. Bathrooms were clean and the dining area is a perfect size. Chipotle&#39;s sustainable practices shine through in every element of this locale (ie. LED lighting and low-flow faucets). Workers were quick to clean up after every guest. A great study.work area. They don&#39;t have WI-FI, but you can easily mooch off of the next door Starbucks.

Conclusion: (Final Score 3.5/5)
A casual place that has good flavor and strong potential. Get those veggies a bit fresher and the rice a bit more cooked and I&#39;ll become a returning customer. They just have to find some ways to be more unique and innovative in a crowded food market.",25/02/16,447,4,4,5,104,14.014500000000002,9.533,1.0470000000000002,37.421,No,3696

shophouse-southeast-asian-kitchen-schaumburg,ana b.,taDFmaenW_90pn-owE7Y3A,kc_Zo9u5aZLvtAbE1TAhMg,"Ugh. I so wanted to love this place. Really. I will forever defend Chipotle to the death, and I was really hoping to swell up with those same feelings of satisfaction and loyalty for ShopHouse.

But ShopHouse was just not good. From the portion sizes to the flavors, this place fell short across all my expectations. 

--Ahem--

Problems:
- Charred everything: the green beans, corn, and steak were the worst offenders. I could give the corn a pass because it tasted pretty much like backyard BBQ corn. The green beans were quite spicy (ShopHouse does get credit for warning about that), but they were also bitter from the char, and that was just a foul compound with whatever sesame or peanut oils seemed to be used in the cooking and flavoring process. 
- I changed my mind, the steak gets its own spot as a problem: THAT STEAK. oh that steak. In short, it was practically inedible. It was tough, bitter, shriveled, and didn&#39;t look or taste like any beef I&#39;ve ever encountered in any of the authentic Vietnamese or Thai restaurants I&#39;ve frequented across the city (especially the gems in Uptown); if the beef was supposed to mirror Malaysian or Indonesian techniques, then it did a poor job inspiring me to want to explore those cuisines in more depth. Blech.
- The scoops of the vegetables were so meager; there just wasn&#39;t enough to complement the rice and/or salad sitting at the bottom of the bowl. A long line of people waited behind me, so I didn&#39;t really feel like exploring all my options for mixing half-and-half or adding extra.
- Overcooked vegetables: maybe they&#39;re playing it safe after Chipotle&#39;s e. Coli scare, but I wanted some crunch to the green beans, some firmness to the squash... maybe for the broccoli to still look kind of green instead of a yellow-brown? The vegetables left much to be desired, texture-wise especially.
- The flavors seemed oversimplified: tamarind sweet-tart, chili spicy, fish sauce salty (not so much umami). Very little complexity unless one opted for the mostly basil and cilantro herb salad as a topping at the end (highly recommended!!). The spring rolls were saltier than I&#39;m used to, but they were actually still quite tasty; more on those later.
- Nothing tasted good together: my mom, sister, and I tried various combinations of the jasmine (white) rice, brown rice, and salad bases with the green beans, squash, and corn. We stayed with the chicken and steak for our proteins, and we got the peanut sauce, tamarind vinaigrette, and spring roll dipping sauce on the side. All our different flavor experiments left horrendous tastes in our mouths. The red curry sounded too spicy for any of us to try, and for some reason we never got the side of green curry sauce we&#39;d requested (even though that one would likely have been too spicy for us to enjoy, too).

ShopHouse&#39;s strengths:
+ The customer service was spot-on, missing green curry sauce notwithstanding. Everyone was pleasant, thorough, and helpful when answering the many questions about all the new food offerings.
+ The spring rolls were pretty nice, especially compared to the rest of the meal. More like second cousins than authentic Vietnamese spring rolls, but they tasted alright and rescued our meal, pretty much. (Although I would NOT recommend trying to put the dipping sauce in one&#39;s protein/veggie bowl.)
+ The little coconut rice + mango parfaits were only $1.50, and their mellow flavor was a nice departure from the spicy charred sweet-tartness of the rest of the food. On the awful-to-amazing spectrum, it&#39;s skewed more toward &#34;meh,&#34; but I&#39;ll include it as a strength; at this point, ShopHouse needs as many positives as they can get.
+ The peanut sauce was relatively palatable. Again, not as tasty as authentic, but also not offensive. It would probably be my go-to sauce if ever I decided to venture into ShopHouse again. 
+ Not a surprise, but both the jasmine and brown rice varieties were nicely cooked and not gummy.
+ Also not a surprise, the baby kale + Napa cabbage salad was fresh and crunchy. Mixing it with the brown rice was A+ choice in one of our bowls.
+ The herb salad garnish option at the end of the bowl: 100% DELIGHTFUL. I wish they used more than glorified tweezers to add it, because I would have welcomed a large handful sprinkled across the top of my entire bowl.

In all, I would never, ever, ever desire ShopHouse over Chipotle or pretty much any other restaurant. Ever. In fact, I will likely never visit ShopHouse again unless I get my hands on another deal for a free bowl. Like Chipotle, ShopHouse isn&#39;t too authentic, but where Chipotle recognizes its lack of authenticity and makes up for it with good portions, fresh quality, and a well-rounded array of complex flavor and texture offerings, ShopHouse is measly and oversimplified and more of a one-note type of establishment. They have a lot of work to do if they want to achieve the dedicated fanbase Chipotle has amassed over the years.",24/01/16,614,2,2,5,19,7.1259999999999994,5.405,3.5210000000000004,36.073,No,5016

It was a Yelp event and with a two year old little guy it&#39;s hard to get out with the hubs. Anyways... This place was pretty neat. I&#39;ve only been to chipotle a couple times and shophouse is a branch off of chipotle. I really like the options that shop house has to offer. I&#39;m a non spicy fan and the shophouse employee helped me and suggested and really good bowl. I got the chicken/steak combo (you can ask to have half of each) and cold noodles. The employees there were really nice and the place looked super clean and the employees were full of knowledge. I really like when places have items to offer to a variety of people&#39;s palettes. Everything I had in my bowl was well put together and the cold noodles were my favorite. It was definitely large enough to have leftovers the next day and my little guy loved everything.

You have to pair the sauce properly otherwise the food would taste weird. For example, in thailand, chicken Satay always go with peanut sauce. You don&#39;t mix curry sauce with chicken Satay because the flavors don&#39;t add up well. If you want to  curry sauce, get the meatball. If you go with the steak laab, go with the vinaigrette sauce, because the &#39;laab&#39; marinate is already an explosion of flavor, with majority sour.

I love Asian cuisine. When I heard this was coming to Schaumburg, I was very excited.
Love the concept. The food is good. The portions are probably less than most of us fattened American&#39;s are use to.  I welcome the change. I&#39;m a 200lb 35 year old grown man, and one regular bowl is enough to fill me up. This is a great lunch location. I&#39;ve noticed a difference in the amount of charring on the meat and veg. I think this is still being worked out.  When it is the right amount of char, it tastes very good.  Too much and the dish can taste burnt. Definitely try the meatballs. I prefer the red curry (wish they included more per serving). There might be a lack of salt to the dishes, but I think maybe we are all to use to overly salty foods. Soy sauce should be available.  I did not think to ask. I generally just top my bowl with Siracha and call it a day. The spring rolls are tasty but overpriced. Overall I like the uniqueness. I think there is room for improvement.  I think this is a better alternative to fast food. Most patrons should be able to find something they like. The service was friendly and inviting. Seems like they are constantly explaining how to choose your items even though it says it right on the menu above the counter.

I absolutely love delicatessens. This is one of the very few Italian ones remaining in the Chicagoland area since Italians have assimilated and are for the most part 2nd or later. I am first generation Polish and I grew up with Polish Delicatessens. Chicagoland has the highest population of ethnic or 1st generation Polish in the USA so there are a ton of delicatessens. Delicatessens have the freshest meats, foods, etc. compared to the Grocery chains. I like my meats and the Polish and Italians know their meats (Polish Sausage/Polish Ham - Italian Sausage/Italian salami and pepperoni). 

This was my second visit to this place. There still have many products from Italy. That is pretty cool. They serve good meats and cheese. They also carry Boers Head! This is, in my opinion, the best top meats you can buy.

Located in a strip mall, this very clean deli had great service and people. Definitely KD&#39;s (Polish) in Schaumburg and Felicia&#39;s has a lot in common when it comes to meats. They take a lot of pride in them.

This morning around 11:30 am I came into the deli looking to try a nice fresh and homemade deli sandwich.  When you walk into the store you&#39;ll notice it is quite tiny, but the way it is setup it allows for you to browse the entire store.  The best way is to walk in and to keep to your right and work your way around to the deli and meat counters where you&#39;l be greeted by someone behind the counter who will get you what you are looking for, offer advice for best meats or grilling techniques, and offer any assistance you may need.

So anyways, I walked around and then made my way around and was asked how I could be helped very quickly and friendly. (A smile truly does go a long way! - Love it).  

I decided to order a 6&#34; cold deli sandwiched called THE BEAST.  It came with Swiss cheese, freshly sliced imported ham, turkey, and roast beef, giardiniera, honey mustard dressing, oil, mayo, and finally tomato and lettuce. This was so big I only ate half for lunch and the sandwich costed just under $7.00.

In addition I also ordered a half pound of the vegetable macaroni salad, which was under $2.00.  I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of it because I felt it lacked seasoning of some sort and it was pretty heavily coated in oil...but I still ate it.  It wasn&#39;t bad at all, just needed something flavorful.  

All in all, I definitely recommend this place!",31/03/15,173,4,2,5,50,5.157000000000001,3.0,0.14,10.861,No,1498

One of my go to items in life is a ham &amp; cheese sandwich. I was craving an amped up ham &amp; cheese for lunch this week, so off to Felicia&#39;s Meat Market I went. And boy did they deliver! My sandwich was packed with so much meat! I got the 6&#34; and had my choice of a couple different breads. I also got to choose from any of their cheeses so I went with Muenster. I&#39;m a cheese fein so loved being able to pick a slightly less popular cheese. For layer upon layer of fresh ham, my choice of cheese &amp; mayo, it ran a bit over $5. Way better quality than a chain sandwich spot so worth the ever so slightly more cost. I found their prices to be completely reasonable.

I had a look over what else they had to purchase and boy do they pack a lot into a tiny space. There are freezers filled with various items for purchase - most being $9-10 and I&#39;m sure would make a fabulous dinner.

This year, my sisters and I surprised my mom with a small dinner party and we took care of the food/cake, etc.

My sister and I decided that a &#34;thanksgiving&#34; type meal would be fun and DELICIOUS!!! My sister ordered a fresh turkey from Felicia&#39;s and we cooked that birdie up good! The bird was fantastic. A fresh turkey is definitely the way to go. Frozen turkeys will be my second choice from now on. 

Now after my sister told me where exactly the store was, I tried my hardest to try to envision it and was not able to. It wasn&#39;t until she told me it was in the same strip mall as Bistro Dragon and Pasta Mia, that I could figure it out. A few days after our mini-thanksgiving meal, I stopped here on my way home from work. I had no idea what I was going to find, but I went in there with an open mind. 

You walk through a wooden framed screen door like you would at grandma&#39;s old house into a small shop. It&#39;s a bit cramped, but it has charm. They have a full meat counter and a small deli. They make fresh sandwiches that I would pick up for lunch if my office was closer. They also have meals premade to-go. Actually everything is to-go, there is nowhere to sit down and eat. They carry Turano Bakery bread which is my personal favorite and I picked up some fresh Italian sausage I used in my pasta sauce that same evening.

The real winner are the baby back ribs.. I can cook but was never good with rubs... UNTIL now. Perfect rib and great taste. He even took off the silver skin for me

felicias-meat-market-and-deli-elk-grove-village,Deandre C.,2UnR2a9ixlsSvOdptjdXrw,kx820bzbL1wrrAiRvHGQxg,"My mom kept bringing me the most delicious eggplant parmesan and I FINALLY discovered that it was from this really nice little deli just blocks from my new home in Schaumburg.

It&#39;s nestled in the south-west corner of a plaza at Meacham and Biesterfield (Wise) roads and from the moment you walk in, you can tell that their specialty is fresh meat. From classic cuts to Whole-Foods-style marinated items, I&#39;ve been quite impressed by their effort to offer more upscale products that people can cook the moment they walk through the door at home. While Whole Foods charges about $9/pound on shish kabobs, Felicia&#39;s is around $6.30/skewer, which hey -- that&#39;s a $3 savings and adds up fast over repeat visits.

I&#39;ve also started coming here for the sandwiches at lunch time; my favorite and full disclosure -- only sandwich I keep getting -- is their standard roast beef. There is nothing more amazing than LOTS of fresh-sliced roast beef with the classic trimmings on french bread.

So why only 4 stars and not 5? Mainly just because of that extra &#34;oomph!&#34; factor. My favorite sandwich has no seasoning; at the least, I would LOVE if their staff asked &#34;Would you like salt, pepper or oregano (whatever)?&#34; on it. The answer would be yes and also give them 5 stars.

I got their tomato/mozzarella salad with a sandwich and that too needed some &#34;oomph!&#34; to taste perfect. I added some parmesan cheese at home, which lent it some salt without that osmosis effect that salt (added at the deli) would have caused to the fresh-cut tomatoes.

So! Awesome place. Great quality. Just needs a little TLC from the spice rack and they are the perfect example of how to run a successful business that makes me WANT to come back.

FYI: Not a fan of their order-line process. Twice now, I was standing there and they asked people behind me for their orders when I was already waiting for a little while (quality takes time, lol). They need to ask &#34;Have you been helped?&#34; BEFORE going down the line and asking someone behind me (or you, anyone really) &#34;What would you like?&#34; -- otherwise, there goes that ordering opportunity when you try to be nice/polite and not say anything.",03/06/15,257,4,2,5,32,5.2962,3.893,0.642,19.464999999999996,No,2220

I&#39;ve waited long enough and the review shall be written. 

Felicia&#39;s is hidden in the back corner of a strip mall loaded with places like Dunkin&#39; Donuts, Pasta Mia, Bistro Dragon and the like. I had been into their parking lot more times than I could count over the years, but never noticed them. Thankfully, I have a co-worker who loves a good meal about as much as I do and she told me about the goodies that I could find here. 

From chicken salad to Italian beef to meatballs to pasta salads and more, this place has got it going on. I&#39;ve tried two different pasta salad and two sandwiches now. I thoroughly enjoyed both. They are a no frills establishment. 

Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found.

1.  Walk in through the swinging screen door and stay to your right. I found this odd at first, but it&#39;s a quirky little place and part of the charm is that random screen door. 

2.  Next, choose your pre-made homemade frozen items to take home for dinner. 

3.  Head down the aisle and grab a frosty beverage from the cooler. 

4. Next, decide on the meat that you want to take home from the butcher area. Everything looks so good!

5.  Go around the bend and realize that it&#39;s lunch time. Listen to tummy rumble. 

6.  Order a marvelous sandwich and go for a homemade side salad.  Skip the bagged chips. 

7.  Continue down past the deli counter to pay and pick up you order. 

8.  Now leave. And go somewhere else to eat your lunch. This is not a dine-in establishment. There&#39;s nowhere to dine.  She would kill me if she read this, but as my mom would say, there&#39;s not even room to fart in there!  Eat in your car, go find a park or take it back to the office.

First, I checked out their website and saw that you can sign up and receive a 10% off coupon. I did that and received my coupon immediately. The only problem, the email contained a full name/address for someone I never heard of. When I filled out my info on the website, it only asked for name and email, never address. I have no idea who this person is yet I now have the full address for a Nick P in St. Charles. When I handed over the email print out of the coupon (which included the address), I told the girl who took my order that it wasn&#39;t me and that they might want to check their system since they are giving out personal info. I don&#39;t think she knew what I was talking about because she just looked at the print out, folded it up and put it next to the register. Hope they get it figured out because I would hate to be Nick P of St. Charles. 

Anyways, the sandwich I got, 10&#34; Italian sub on white was OK.

My standards must have been lower then they are now, because back &#34;in the day&#34; I loved this place.  That love has flown the coop and I will never be back.

When we went for lunch we discovered that a lunch buffet was being offered.  It was $2 more than the regular offerings on the lunch menu ($12/buffet; $10/lunch menu).  The prices were considerably more than what was listed on their website and I really don&#39;t like to spend more than $8 for lunch.

Service was non-existent.  When we needed refills we had to flag down the bus boy--the waitress was no where to be found.  The food on the buffet was mediocre at best.  A sign posted next to one dish said &#34;Cheese Enchiladas&#34;.  They weren&#39;t cheese, they were chicken.  When I asked about the cheese enchiladas I was told they didn&#39;t have any and the only sign they had was chicken enchiladas.

What saved dinner was the fact that they have a vegetarian menu, after asking our waitress what my vegetarian hubby could order. The regular menu was slim pickens for him. 4-stars for the menu discovery! You have to ask for it.

We decided to go for an Ikea run tonight, and everyone seemed to be craving Mexican food. We ended up here by default, because we realized the other smaller independent restaurants we were considering closed at 6pm. Lalo&#39;s was a bit out of the way, but a nice place for a family meal. 

The chips are homemade here, but they were underwhelming for me and the salsa wasn&#39;t very exciting. I enjoyed the chicken soup starter to the meal. Served with a lime, it had a nice kick to it. The kids menu is great, and for ages 10 and under. My hearty eating nine year old boys filled up quickly. The menu is divided into two sections--hungry and extra hungry. They ate for $5.50 and each kid got a mini bowl of soup, steak tacos, rice or fries. They loved it! Hubby ordered guac. tacos, and I ended up with chicken and beef flautas with guac., rice and refried beans. In retrospect, I wish I would have ordered off the vegetarian menu. I felt a little wonky after eating...just too much food for me. 

Would I come here again? Probably not. It&#39;s just not super convenient, and I didn&#39;t find the meal to be memorable after leaving.

First, the lunch buffet. I was not a fan. Limited selection of room-temperature food. Pass.

Second, dinner. Very good! I&#39;ve had dinner here several times and the entrees have always been tasty. The apps are a little bland but that&#39;s not really a big deal. You don&#39;t leave a movie because the previews were boring, right?

Third, the bar. Totally different vibe from the dining room. There were a few different things going on in the bar while we were there. Part sports bar, part singles bar for older people, and mix in an occasional large group of women drinking margaritas and getting their swerve on with mariachi bands.

Our party of 4 got there around 7:40pm on a Friday night and it was busy, but no wait, awesome.

We were greeted with some chips and salsa and our server to take our drink order. 1/2 price draft specials and $6.50 red or white sangria, hmmMmmm sangria. I went with the red sangria and it was delicious and fruity, so I had 2 glasses. 

We ordered their Botana Combinada: combination appetizers of nachos, quesadilla, tamales, flautas, and seafood empanada. I always like ordering any combo dish because you get to taste a little bit of everything. My favorite had to be the seafood empanada although i wish it came with more then one. The flautas and tamales were a bit dry, but nothing a little bit of sour cream and guac can&#39;t fix. The quesadilla had ham in it and it was delicious.

I ordered the carne asada a la tampiquena, medium rare and it was perfect. The skirt steak was cooked to perfection with the warm red in the middle, so tender and juicy, drools. I thought the rice and beans and were just okay, but the steak definitely made the meal. I was really satisfied. (It always made for a good steak and egg english muffin sandwich the next morning.)

I ordered the carne Asada. Huge portio of streak! The steak was good. Rice and beans were good. However, my boyfriend had the burrito and he said we could have gotten one from the Mexican place down the street. It was nothing special. 

I give three stars for my portion of streak and the prices were good. Paid 60 bucks including tip for everything and the dinners included a soup and I had a drink.

AYCE buffet every day! I have been here before and was less than impressed by the buffet but I have been away for many years until this past month. I went on a weekday, the buffet is priced at 9.99 I believe or somewhere around that price. You are greeted with a bonanza of mexican food items including spinach quesadilla, small burritos ( I would stay away from this), taquitos chicken/beef, fresh taco station with chicken, beef (res) this was amazing go with this) in flour or corn tortilla. There was even mole and other traditional mexican dishes. Unlimited guac as well in the salad bar area. To top it off rice pudding or flan. This is a nice change of pace from other lunch venues. I would highly recommend if you like traditional mexican food.

It took a while to get a glass of water and another while to get a refill.  The food is decent and the prices are reasonable (on the higher end for Mexican food).  I came for dinner on a Friday night and the place was packed.  The bright and colorful decorations added to the ambiance of the restaurant.  Definitely good for large groups since they have tons of space and tables.  The chip and salsa were good and help curb the appetite while waiting for the food to come out.

I ordered a medium mango margarita, which was delicious and I couldn&#39;t even taste the alcohol.  For $11, it&#39;s almost like a meal.  

The flautas dinner came with some guac, rice, and beans for $12.  I didn&#39;t think the flautas were anything special and they were kind of on the dry side (dried shredded chicken).  The guacamole was very good, but I think that&#39;s rather difficult to mangle.  The rice was tasty and fluffy.

The lady behind me got a glass of margarita dumped on her when a waitress lost her balance.  I&#39;ve been there before and was glad it wasn&#39;t me this time.

Had a taste for Mexican food today, so my friend and I decided to give Lalo&#39;s buffet a try.  Now I remember why i hadn&#39;t been to one in like 20 years.  It was without a doubt the worst Mexican food I ever had.  No idea why/how people actually like this place.  Guess the drinks must be good.  The buffet was over priced ($11) and tasteless.   Come on people.....how about at least using some Adobo?  We should have known the meal would be bad when we sampled the salsa provided with the chips.  The chips had an odd taste, and the salsa was like a can of crushed tomatoes.  No taste at all.  We arrived at about 12:30, the restaurant was empty and the buffet was nearly bare.

The interior decorating is amazing. You can tell that a lot of money was invested and you see it in the details from the tile to the art work on display.

Interior is one thing but what about the food? I found the al pastor and the carne asada to be mediocre. The portions were large which helped justify the pricing but it wasn&#39;t memorable. I would relate the food to their lunch buffet where it satisfies your craving even though it&#39;s not the best Mexican food that you&#39;ve had. We had a coupon which helped offset the cost.

My mother and I decided on the lunch buffet (even though I NEVER do buffets). The first time we served ourselves there weren&#39;t too many options but we say the employees filling the dishes so we figured we&#39;ll have better luck a little later.  
For our second trip to the buffet there were even less options.  I then noticed one of the workers filling up the dishes with only a few items at at a time. For example instead of bringing out a full tray of mini burritos he would bring 4 or 5 at a time.  Unfortunately he did this for every dish. There were enough customers going to the buffet so there was never enough food.  I had to ask him 3 times to fill the buffet. He would just smile smile and nod.
Our waiter was even worse than the buffet. We had to ask him several times for extra napkins which he never brought over. My water (which was the only thing I was drinking) never got filled.

They have a GREAT lunch buffet 7 days a week and for about $12.00 (including drink) you can have a nice lunch....that is, if you can get your drink. 

We ALWAYS get there right when they open and when the food is fresh because if you get there later in the afternoon, the food is garbage. All Mexican food dries out easily so it&#39;s difficult to keep it moist and fresh tasting. 

We have done take out a few times. Not good. They box the food in Styrofoam which simply makes the crunchy foods soggy because they put it steaming hot into the container. Perhaps, if they changed how the food was packed, it would improve. For example: put deep friend flautas or tacos in a hard shell in paper packaging. Cold garnishes should be left outside of the box or bag and packed separately because hot food and cold sour cream don&#39;t mix when it may be transported for up to 20 minutes. 

Be sure to use your bathroom at home before you go, you will not want to use theirs. Also, a shame, because we always rush out when we leave because I don&#39;t want to use their restrooms.

They also offer 1/2 price appetizers Monday through Friday from 4(??) until 7pm in the bar area. They know how to make authentic Mexican food.

We went later on a Friday evening with another couple for dinner. The bar area was packed and had a dj playing music, but there only were two or three other tables in the dining room. 
Our server greeted us right away and brought our drinks quickly. When it came time to order our dinner, it was so loud that we had to shout over not only the dj from the bar area, but a mariachi band in the dining room. 
The reason for only 1 star? My order was incorrect when the server brought it out and she disappeared so quickly that I had to wait at least 5 minutes for her to come back. I informed her that I had asked for NO onions on my tacos and that there was nothing except for onions on my tacos. She brought the dish to the kitchen and returned with another plate before quickly disappearing again. They simply covered the onions that I didn&#39;t want with cheese and tomatoes. My husband had to go find her after waiting another 5 minutes. At that point, I asked her to just bring the check and that I no longer wanted dinner. The check was just under $100 for the four of us and I didn&#39;t even eat anything. There was no visit from a manager and nothing extended for this extremely poor experience.

We only live a few blocks from Lalos in Schaumburg and we love it.  Why?  Two reasons: Margaritas and Guacamole.  

Most often, we don&#39;t even order food there.  They have table-side guacamole and the best margaritas in town.  The margs are little pricy, but they also have a ton of tequila in them... so it&#39;s pretty much worth it.

The service is always friendly and the food is decent.  I never really order any dinner there, we just order the appetizers.  

I really don&#39;t have too much to complain about except the bar area sometimes.  Once in a while, my parents and I will go to the bar area because you can get half off of the appetizers before 6 (I think) and one time we were the only ones in the bar and they were BLASTING the music.  I have no idea why, but we had to ask them to turn it down and for some reason they said no.  I couldn&#39;t really hear them but it was something to do with the sound system for later that night.  They should figure out better music to play in there some nights but most of the time it&#39;s a lot of fun.

Still a favorite of ours.

The food is fresh and authentic.  I love the chips and salsa here, great homemade taste.  At the weekend lunch buffet, I also love the steak fajitas which are a perfect mix of vegetables and tender beef.  The eggs and rice are another favorite, again great homemade taste and flavor.  There&#39;s also a good variety of enchiladas.  We come here often with our kids and there&#39;s plenty for them to choose from (and they can be picky).

DJ Bistro is in a strip mall in Lake Zurich, and if you are looking for French it is the best for 10 miles, and maybe one of the best restaurants in that far northwest burb area. It is not unreasonably priced for what is served, but expensive for area.

Festive but busy and not in keeping with the quaint French atmosphere we are used to having. We think they were overwhelmed with the crowds as the food was very mediocre and not at all up to their normal output.

The lardon and frisee salad was underwhelming - watery frisee (was it even spun dry?) and minimal lardons created a watery and flavorless dressing once mixed with the egg.

The tuna three ways came out with the blackened tuna way overcooked even though I had specifically said to &#34;bring it swimming&#34; if possible that&#39;s how raw I like it. They redid it and it was much better when returned. The poke version was the best but what doesn&#39;t taste good with soy, sugar and sesame oil added to it?

The panko crusted chicken cordon blue was tepid and not crispy and the frites came out cold and had to be returned.

Desserts were OK - a caramel ice cream had broken and did not have a smooth texture one could feel the grainy bits of milks solids in it. The crepes Suzette were OK - not buttery or orangey enough.

This place is a diamond in the rough! I hadn&#39;t been here before, and I was part of a large party. And, of course, I&#39;m gluten free (*sigh* I try really hard not to be the difficult one, but here I am...). I mentioned to the server that I am gluten free, and he said that he would talk to the chef to ask which items were safe. To my surprise, most of the items selected on the fixed menu were gluten free already! He was very informative and went line by line down the menu, informing me of which items were safe and which were to be avoided. I was served a homemade sorbet for dessert, and the biggest surprise of all was that they brought out gluten free bread with my soup! People, I ate BREAD at a restaurant with SOUP - two things that rarely happen!! The hostess (owner?) also assured me that they could accommodate any dietary restriction and was very helpful.

d-and-j-bistro-lake-zurich,Stephanie T.,DaO9ag_s3Hc4hHDV69DVsw,UpLyLbYM_HaxJ5twAjNuzQ,"OK, so it took me a long time to go back, but after a March trip to Paris, I just had to have some French food! Everything still stands from my prior review, and I was impressed with all the food we tried last night. The salad of the day was a delicious mix of golden beets, mandarin oranges, arugula, walnuts, with citrus vinaigrette and a goat cheese crustini. And not that kind of gritty goat cheese that&#39;s just OK, the really good creamy tangy kind. Really fresh and flavorful.

I had to try their duck confit to compare with the amazing version I had in France, and I was pleasantly surprised! No, it was not the same, but really good and tender. The duck fell apart with a fork and had a rich sauce that complimented the wild mushroom risotto it is served over. The only thing I felt I was missing out on was the crispy skin that would push this dish over the edge, but the flavors were all there. My dining partner had pork tenderloin medallions which were fantastic! They were likely the best pork I can remember having in recent times- very moist and cooked perfectly. Also had a great sauce over them, smoky, but not overwhelming. I guess those Frenchies know their sauces!

Didn&#39;t have any dessert as I usually prefer to drink my dessert, so polishing off the rest of the bottle of wine ended our meal. Again, I love that their wine list has different options from the usual, and really reasonably priced. 

The only negative was the absence of the bathroom chalkboard. Where did it go? Why did it leave? How can it not be a fun thing to leave messages for future bathroom users? And then addition of the strange painting of the naked man (important parts covered with a sash- you know you are going to check out my picture now) on the bathroom door was a bit jarring. I guess he is supposed to be drool-worthy, but I was just creeped out by how long his torso was. I estimated his pant size to be 32-26. I heard that the men&#39;s room had a similarly unclad woman as well, who also had odd proportions. I hate to hate on someone&#39;s hand painted efforts, but I really don&#39;t mind a plain old door, especially for the bathroom.

This is a great place to return to as the menu changes seasonally and the food has consistently been really good. I&#39;m also a sucker for being called &#34;mademoiselle&#34;.",17/05/13,254,4,2,5,22,5.3392,3.582,1.7919999999999998,19.625999999999998,No,2330

The menu is enticing with the right amount of daily specials.  We look for a charming and fun ambience with delicious food and wines.  We do not mind waiting for our table as the restaurant is quite busy.  The active bar scene creates an enjoyable start to the experience. The problem was our waiter. Once seated, the waiter rattled off the specials so quickly without asking us if we ready to hear or offering us a drink. Once we were able to interrupt, our drink order taken but when served, the waiter misdirected the drinks and even spilled one. He knew he spilled, did not apologize or offer to clean or blot the table. We did not have time for a sip of our drinks and again, we were bombarded with his repetition of the specials.  We said we would like to relax a bit and we would let him know when we were ready to order.  Every few minutes, he would run by us and attempt to take our order.

I am a foodie - I have tried and eaten almost anything that has come my way.  (As you could tell by looking at me, but that is a totally different conversation.)  ;-)  

When I visited Paris one of the things I was told that I HAD to try was Steak Tartare - I never had it before going to Paris, but I loved it.  When I saw it on the menu here, I had high hopes.  It was a case of antici-pointment if I ever had one - it was ground so finely it had no texture.  It also lacked any seasoning.

For an entree, I had the seafood risotto - the mussels and clams were cooked well, but had quite a bit of grit in them and in one case, the beard was still attached to the mussel.  The scallops were cooked beautifully but the shrimp were the opposite side of the spectrum - they were overcooked and rubbery.  A perfect risotto is supposed to be creamy ans &#39;loose&#39;.  This was a big pile of &#39;starchy glop&#39; in the middle of the plate that they put the seafood on.  When I tasted the risotto, I felt like channeling my inner Gordon Ramsay and imagined going back to the kitchen and saying, &#34;This is overcooked, you donkey!&#34;  

I can&#39;t comment on my wife&#39;s entree, I didn&#39;t try it as I was not in the mood for tuna that night.

The wine menu had a nice variety of wines and we selected a good one, unfortunately our waiter was very aggressive in refilling our glasses.  We told him multiple times, we didn&#39;t want our glasses refilled yet he kept swooping in from angles where we didn&#39;t see him to keep topping us off.  We had planned on bringing home half of the bottle to enjoy at home, but with his aggressive pouring style, that was not an option.",03/08/12,185,2,2,3,14,2.7043000000000004,1.3020000000000003,0.376,14.322000000000001,No,1773
d-and-j-bistro-lake-zurich,Joan S.,zLqBp7_XCyqaWdKaOzfTng,f0CsGnVTIJuW2MEC8iuL4w,"Oh my goodness!

My sister took me here for a birthday dinner. I&#39;ve always thought this place was more tapas and casual. I was surprised to find it was a very traditional French bistro with full - and quite excellent - dinner service. 

We split a goat cheese salad for an appetizer. These can be so bland, but at D&amp;J, it had really lovely beets, pear and mango added, and the cheese was delicately fried in bread crumbs so it had that perfect, spreadable, warm texture. Really excellent! 

For dinner, she got a steak Diane and I had the Chateaubriand, two mini filets wrapped in pancetta with a delicate sauce I couldn&#39;t quite figure out - shallots, wine and some other things, I think. It was in the top five steaks I&#39;ve ever had. My son ate my leftovers and said it was the best he&#39;d ever had. So worth the money! 

At the beginning of the meal, my sister (a regular there) introduced me to the owner. When we finished the meal, they brought me a special birthday dessert plate - not requested, just showed up - with my NAME on the plate! Now that&#39;s attention to detail! The three little desserts (mousse, cheesecake, creme brulee in a cookie crust) were a perfect end to the meal. 

My sister tells me they love this place for the outdoor patio and DOG menu! She showed me afterward the little menu they have for dogs and it is so cute - rice and meat-based meals that are all just $5 or $6. Too cute that the dog can go with them too. 

It&#39;s in a strip mall and the outdoor tables face the parking lot. I expected it to be less special for this, but the truth is there&#39;s a little buffer around the tables that make you completely forget you&#39;re not in a garden somewhere. 

The only thing I regret is not having tried this restaurant sooner. Yes, prices are special occasion...but I will now choose this over just about any other special occasion restaurant we&#39;ve gone to in the past. The food, the pace of the dinner, the incredibly attentive service, the unpretentious help with choosing a wine...all of it felt relaxed and casually elegant.

okay. Raspberries and whipped cream on top of a glass of champagne and some ice cream. Didn&#39;t work as well as I hoped, and the champagne was a bit overpowering.

We&#39;re absolutely and 100% passionate about food. At first it was impossible to think of a single place (even in downtown Chicago) that we thought could pull it off. Until we remembered our favorite suburbs restaurant - D&amp;J. From day one of reaching out, D&amp;J&#39;s owners worked closely with us to propose the perfect reception menu and event details, working well within our budget. Without a doubt, planning for the dinner was the easiest and most fun part of our wedding thanks to D&amp;J. That said - let me get to the good part.

D&amp;J flawlessly executed a five-course menu for over 80 guests which were made to order, as our guests had several choices for each course. Every. Single. Dish. Was. Perfect. In fact, we were delighted to notice that about a third of our guests actually requested to take their leftovers home (anyone else find that surprising for a wedding??). 

Beyond that, service was impeccable. D&amp;J&#39;s friendly and attentive staff made the five most perfect hours of our day fly by. Above and beyond, both owners were there providing support and delighting our guests. At the end of the night, all of the staff proactively pitched in to help us clean up our wedding decorations/favors/etc. 

We were surprised to hear from our parents that many of our guests contacted them randomly days and weeks after the wedding, telling them how special the night was and how much they enjoyed the food.

D&amp;J was absolutely integral to the success of our wedding day. For that, we will be forever in debt to them. Thank you D&amp;J from the bottom of our hearts! You will see us again very very soon!

While I&#39;m hardly a wine expert, I thought their wine list was excellent and had several very reasonably priced wines.

But, of course, the reason to come to D&amp;J is for the food.  Each time I&#39;ve eaten here the meal has been wonderful (my less-than-outstanding experience was due to the service not the food).

On my last visit, I wanted to try something different and had the &#39;Le Menage a Trois of Ahi Tuna&#39;.  It was incredible.  My only mistake was letting my wife try it.

The perception, as you drive up to what could easily be mistaken as a bad Greek diner, is quickly disintegrated as you enter the door. The restaurant tends to sprawl out in a maze of cozy spaces and nooks. There is a quirkiness to the flooring and the layout that gives it a back street French treasure feel. 

The menu is varied and after four visits now we have yet to experience less than stellar service. Wine is nice and not wallet busting and they keep the appetizer dollars down to invite you to indulge. Desserts are nice (I did not partake but my wife and friends liked it) and the evening was wonderful. 

The waitress got a little &#34;quick&#34; pulling our bread off the table as we finished but when we expressed an interest in packing that to go also she quickly replaced it with a warm fresh bag full. Class response that left a warm fuzzy feeling. 

DJ&#39;s is not 5 stars but it&#39;s also not 5 star dollars. They are a great dinner experience and they keep it affordable. They know what they are and stay the course doing what they do best.

The restaurant&#39;s barroom is closed until dinner, but I took a seat there because I was alone and in the mood for some quiet. At another restaurant I&#39;d expect this: &#34;I&#39;m sorry sir but you&#39;ll have to sit in the dining room.&#34; Here, the waitress didn&#39;t flinch. No problem, she said.

I order the mahi mahi and mention that last time the fish was tremendous. It was a special on the menu, I tell her, some type of Hawaiian fish. I can&#39;t remember the name; neither can she. Two minutes later, the waitress leans out from the kitchen, &#34;Was it Hebi?&#34; &#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; I say. &#34;Some came in fresh this morning. Would you prefer that?&#34; &#34;Absolutely...&#34;

The chef himself soon walks out, sets an oven-hot plate in front of me. &#34;I prepared it differently than the mahi,&#34; he says. On my plate, seared medallions of the hebi, still very rare, arranged over grilled asparagus with pickled ginger piled to the side. Grilled slices of zucchini, portabella and tomato, a ramekin filled with a light cream sauce. Delicious, especially the fish -- like French-inspired sashimi.

The food isn&#39;t always this spectacular. But after several dinners, I can vouch for the Steak Diane, the lamb burger and the steamed mussels. My wife likes the braised rabbit. Their bread always tastes like it was baked ten minutes ago. Affordable wines, good traditional martinis. Half the staff seems to remember us when we walk in, and they always smile. Not a very young scene but still lively some nights. From outside, it may be a bland looking strip-mall bistro. But give it a shot.

I started with the goat cheese salad and had the duck confit with mushroom risotto. I&#39;m a simple salad girl and this actually had a lot going on but it was tasty. My duck and risotto was phenomenal. It had a strong flavor but wasn&#39;t overly salty which duck and risotto can be. 

My dining companions were also pleased but I must call out that the jambalaya special was so hot, temperature wise, that my boyfriend was unable to eat for at least 10 minutes. Once he was able to eat the entree he was a bit disappointed. He felt like a special would stand out more and it being jambalaya would have an intense flavor and in hindsight would have rather had the Steak Diane. The rest of the entrees were great.

It was way too warm inside.  I was uncomfortable and to the point of getting sleepy

We ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer and two entrees.  The appetizer was meh, ok...Steak Tartare.  Mostly tasted like admittedly well seasoned hamburger meat but none of the buttery creaminess that I&#39;ve experienced with other places.

Hubby got the seafood risotto - mussels and scallops were right on.  Shrimp were overcooked and instead of the risotto being creamy it was a starchy glump.

I got the tuna trio which was described on the menu as a tartare style, seared, and wasabi crusted.  What came was two out of the three matching what I expected and I guess the wasabi crusted was what was breaded and deep fried.  Not what I would expect from the menu description and a waste of a nice piece of fish.  The other two tuna preparations were nice though.

Finally the service.  We were pacing ourselves on the wine and the waiter kept trying to top off the glasses.  When we were at half a bottle he looked at it like he didn&#39;t want to cork it and bag it for us to take home.  He filled DH&#39;s glass without waiting and I had to tell him three times to stop pouring on my 3/4 full glass, I didn&#39;t want more wine.  So we had to leave a bottle about a quarter full and two almost full glasses when we left.  I was not happy to say the least.

The food was incredible, like they need another five star review but I&#39;d like to add that it was nice to go into a restaurant and FINALLY see an involved and caring owner (most places feel like no one is in charge except a 20 year old hostess standing by the front door who probably couldn&#39;t find the front door if something when wrong).

Looks like there&#39;s a few things on the menu added just for the suburbanites that don&#39;t really belong, even though I&#39;ve only been here this one time, and once waaaaaaaay back when they opened, I&#39;d say stick with the basic French fares.

The owner couldn&#39;t have been nicer, maybe a bit too charming with his french accent and kiss on the hand ...

I have been coming here for years but recently celebrated my birthday here last week. As hoped - everything was delicious as always. 

The restaurant is rather large but comfortable - so reservations are strongly encouraged as its always packed to the brim. Service is quick and spot on and food is outta this world! I had the escargot which is better here than any French places I have tried in the city (sorry Chicago I love you), roasted duck and foie gras and topped it all with several drinks including a glass of absinthe.

While the food was pretty good, our service was terrible!! We&#39;ve had better service at a Chilis than this! Our server took forever to take our order and once our entrees arrived, we did not see him again until it was time for our bill. No one bothered to come and check on us except for the busser. We did notice that if you were a regular there, you seemed to get rockstar treatment, with everyone from the manager to the owner checking on your table and making sure everything was right,  but we were virtually ignored throughout our dinner. It was impersonal and when we complained to the maitre d, he seemed ambivalent and unconcerned. 

The frites were limp and not crispy at all, although the venison my fiance ordered was superb. We also enjoyed the steak tartare appetizer. The service really brought down the entire experience for us. If you are going to spend that much money for a meal, you expect the service to match the quality of the food.

A few standouts are their mussels in a classic white wine broth; light and tasty, and the delectable escargots bubbling and sizzling away from their little pools of melty Pernod garlic butter - Oh Baby, all I needed was bread and some privacy!! Don&#39;t be shy and ask your server to fix you up a cheese plate... it&#39;s not really on the menu, but what&#39;s a French meal without your cheese course?? That&#39;s like Peanut Butter without the Jelly, A Fat Kid without Cake, Birds with no Bees. Enjoy being served a beautiful and decadent 6 cheese sampling complete with grapes, fig cake and that wonderful warm, crusty French baguette. Do not miss this lactose feast!! 

The entrees are just as fantastic and inventive as anything you&#39;d find in the big, bad city... tangy and piled high salad nicoise, kobe waygu beef, steak frites with shallot butter and roasted black mission figs wrapped in pancetta over a boursin tartine.

As I had been warned, there it was, unassumingly between Gino&#39;s East and a hair salon.  I guess the only good thing you can say about the location is that it has easy parking.

As soon as we walked in we were greeted, in French by, the maitre&#39;de and seated quickly there after.  The wine list was informative, well rounded and inexpensive. (I guess if you get 20 miles out of the city and everything is cheap!)  Starting with a glass of Kir Royal and I slowly sank into a nice cozy buzz that enhanced the rest of the evening.  You gotta love the person who invented the idea of aperitif- booze to stimulate your palate, I like it!  

While I enjoyed my bubbly libation we shared the mussels, escargots and cheese platter.  All amazing!  The mussels were served in a lovely white wine shallot broth, the escargots came piping hot in a garlicky butter sauce and the selection of cheeses was relatively diverse, we liked two of them so much we saved their names for future reference.  My main was a salade niÌ¤oise with seared tuna rather than flaked.  I really enjoyed it.  It was well dressed, and full of crispy haricort verts, potatoes, capers, olives and white anchovies which really added to the flavor.  Of course they had many delightful items on the menu if you are not in the mood for salad; I just happen to be a sucker for both seared tuna and niÌ¤oise olives!

D&amp;J Bistro has been around since 1987 serving wonderful classic French cuisine with some modern twists. The other day, for my second visit, I decided to try the special dish of Prince Edward Island mussels in a coconut curry sauce with angel hair pasta. The portion size was just right and the sauce, although not something I would typically find in France, was perfectly seasoned and scrumptious. The mussels were fresh and abundant. My mother and I had already split the chicken liver mousse patÌ© as an appetizer with garlic toasted baguette. That&#39;s always our chosen hors d&#39;oeuvre. For her main dish, she had a bowl of the day&#39;s corn chowder, which was also delicious. The wine list is long and impressive; we each had a glass of the Vouvray Domaine Pichot Loire white wine, described as having an &#34;off-dry and flattering taste with quince, fig, and pear flavors&#34;.

We went here this morning (Sunday), at 9:15. It was busy!! We waited 20 minutes to be seated, no big deal. We were seated at a small table near the coffee bar, a bit too cold of a breeze coming from the front door constantly opening (next time I&#39;d wait for a better seat).

Our server was Rachel, she was awesome!! Despite being super busy, she was on top of her game....quick to bring out drinks, food, and predicted our needs (bringing condiments and such). I was even offered a to-go cup to take my coffee home, nice touch!!

On to the food....
I had The Goat omelette with crispy potatoes and a biscuit. The omelette was good, but not great. I&#39;ve had similar dishes elsewhere that were better. The sausage had a strong/odd flavor. But the crispy potatoes were PHENOMENAL! They were seasoned perfectly. The biscuit was good but dry. I definitely needed to use the butter and jam that accompanied it. 

Let me preface my husband&#39;s order by saying he usually complains that breakfast portions are too small (ala Egg Harbor and Nosh). Not here! He had the Corned Beef Brisket skillet which offered such a large portion he brought some home!! It had large chunks of brisket and as he stated &#34;was the best corner beef skillet he&#39;s ever had&#34;.

Chicken n biscuits 11.99$ this was the worst chicken n biscuits dish i ever had the chicken was a lil greasy so it wasnt crispy. The chicken was really small so after a couple of bites ur left wanting more. The flavor of the chicken was really bland one of the worst fried chickens i ever had how could somebody mess up fried chicken. The biscuits were really hard n flavorless frozen biscuits would have been better then these. I love gravy but the gravy was really bland even sausage couldnt save the taste of this dish. Instead of house potatoes which i hate because their always old n flavorless which is how they are at his establishment i ordered fries. I loved the texture of the fries but they werent seasoned so that is dissapointing wouldnt order this again if it was free

Eggs your way with a side of pancakes 5.99$ the house potatoes were old n luke warm n they werent even that cripsy they werent seasoned so the only place they belong is in the trash. The eggs were cooked good but werent seasoned. The pancakes were very plain i didnt care for them n the maple syrup was a really basic one wouldnt order this again

Corned beef melt 10.79$ surprising but the corned beef was actually good. It wasnt to sour which corn beef can be n it was seasoned really well. I likes the cheese it was really good but i didnt like the veggies in it i didnt see a purpose to it i wish it was served with mustard there was no sauce if they added a sauce the dish would be alot better",13/09/16,191,1,1,1,8,0.8788999999999998,1.2910000000000001,0.9500000000000001,8.762000000000002,No,1707

I met one of my besties here for brunch while she&#39;s in town visiting. At 11 am on a Tuesday there was a 5-10 minute wait for a table (no biggie). The hostess and our waitress were super nice. I haven&#39;t seen my friend in months, so we were those people who chatted with our beverages for forever before finally looking at the menu to place an order. Our waitress was super understanding though and didn&#39;t care at all. She just told us to put our menus in the middle of the table when we were ready so she didn&#39;t have to bother us by checking in often.

I ordered a decaf coffee and she brought my own canister so I can pour as I please which was great. She still came around and refilled my cup though since I was chatting away. The tiny little metal milk cups were adorable too.

For my meal I went with the eggs your way. For only $5.99 this was a lot of food! Two eggs served how you like them with crispy potatoes, plus your choice of toast, english muffin,
biscuit or a short stack of our buttermilk pancakes. I got my eggs scrambled and chose an english muffin. I was even able to upgrade my potatoes so they had bacon and veggies in them -- delicious!

Our waitress was very nice and thoroughly explained a few dishes and answered any questions we had. She was quite shocked at the &#34;smorgasbord&#34; we ordered. There were 3 of us and we got a ton of food! 

We started off with the crepes as an &#34;appetizer.&#34; I ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes, which literally tasted like a cinnamon roll pressed into a pancake. The icing on the top was absolutely delicious and the pancakes were perfectly fluffy. I got the duck bacon as a side dish and wasn&#39;t too impressed with it. The waitress described it as a &#34;rarer bacon that sometimes need to be cut wth a fork and knife&#34; and that is exactly how it was. It was a little too fatty for me. I also ordered the Bellini, which was tasty and refreshing! 

The rest of our table ordered the following: &#34;eggs your way&#34; with smoked salmon, potatoes, and toast AND the B&amp;G, add the E with potatoes and ham. Everything was absolutely delicious. The portions are huge, so we certainly didn&#39;t finish all of the food. But, we did box it up for later :)

buttermilk-geneva,Owen B.,RUkLH1i152bEqfqwgnOpjA,#NAME?,"Really, really good but kinda let down at the same time....

I had ordered the Market skillet with onions, shrooms, spinach, Tom, and Broc topped with cheddar and jack cheese. This all comes on homefries and with 2 egg on top (I got sunnyside up). About half way in i though something might be wrong. No tom or broc and was finding bacon pieces. Turns out I was given a Mountain House skillet. similar enough so and I just rolled with it. 

Skillet thoughts: sautÌ©ed veggies were awesome, potatoes we nice and crispy, eggs were perfect, but waaay too smothered in cheese for me. Combined with the egg juices, the amount of cheese gave the bowl a consistency close to chili. Kinda a mushy mess, but partly my fault for ordering runny eggs. End of the day it was still tasty enough and filled a void. 

The rye toast and homemade berry jam were both FANTASTIC. I would come back for those alone. 

Her omelette, the Goat, was top notch. I was sorta jealous. Just how she likes it: lots of spinach and tomato and goat cheese. She had a
side of pancakes and shared: heaven.

We went at 8:45 this morning (Friday) and it was crazy crowded within a few minutes of sitting down. I&#39;m guessing it may be because high schools are graduating/finishing this week, and there were a lot of  14-18 y/o kids there. Still, service was prompt and the host, servers, and bus boys we interacted with were great. 

The buttermilk pancakes are excellent - light, but filling. The crispy potato side dish was generally very tasty (and I judge all breakfast places by their potatoes). Some were over-seasoned (especially with salt) and some were barely seasoned, but mixing it up together it was good. The seasoning tastes a bit like those mesquite bbq chips I used to take to lunch in elementary school, and I love it.

Better yet, maybe I should move into one of those swanky condos behind this breakfast place.  My breakfast cravings would be satisfied for the rest of my life!

I&#39;ve been wanting to go here for a while.  However, every time we attempted to go, which was mostly on a Saturday, the wait was annoying and too long.  I decided to come on a weekday, close to closing time.  Anyways, absolutely ADORABLE restaurant.  It&#39;s modern with a twist of country chic!  Lots of black and white decor....so simple and beautiful.  Also, clean place!!

There&#39;s a lot on the menu.  It took me 20 mins to figure out if I wanted breakfast or lunch, if i wanted to pig out or eat clean.  Screw it, I went and chose something indulgent.  So I&#39;m a sucker for biscuits and gravy. I ordered their B &amp; G with an E: housemade biscuits with sausage gravy, scrambled eggs and a side of potatoes.  Oh geeez, 10 stars for the biscuits and gravy.  Those biscuits are huge, flaky and melt in your mouth perfection with a yummy buttery flavor.  The sausage gravy meshed so well with the biscuits.  Ughhh, it was such a hearty dish, I couldn&#39;t finish it  (they give you 3 big portions of biscuits).  And they top those with fluffy scrambled eggs.  Perfectly cooked. Happy happy joy joy!  

As I said earlier, if you decide to go on the weekend, you need to come early otherwise the wait is ridiculous.  The best is during the weekday in my opinion.  Just take a day off and come here.  And the best part is it&#39;s just a walking distance away from the river so you can enjoy a stroll to walk off whatever you ate!

This place screams delicious from the name, to the decor and most assuredly the food. If Geneva were across the street you&#39;d find me here every weekend. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not. And perhaps that&#39;s for the best considering the size of the breakfast I had here. 

When you walk in, you&#39;re greeted by an atmosphere straight out of New England, as Buttermilk may be just as at home on a quaint street somewhere in the Hamptons. Whitewashed wood, with well-thought accents adorn the restaurant.

The servers are pleasant and friendly, and coming here on a Friday morning around 10, I didn&#39;t have to wait for a second to be seated. I&#39;ll bet that&#39;s not the case on the weekends, as anyone who knows about this place probably stops by. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if wait times get pretty steep during prime brunching times. 

The menu knocked me over with all the amazing choices. Eventually I settled on the chicken fried chicken skillet because I was truly trying to see just how many calories I could consume in one sitting. Spoiler alert? Not really. 

IT WAS INCREDIBLE! Do not adjust your screens, I&#39;m talking in all-caps here. First of all, what was put before me was practically a bucket of freshly fried chicken breast covered in sausage gravy and cheese, blanketed under my over-easy eggs, all sitting atop a mountain of potatoes cooked with bacon and ham plus peppers and onions. Holy cow, I&#39;m drooling just typing all that. 

All that, plus a fresh made buttermilk biscuit that came with fresh preserves and what (in my imagination) was a ball of freshly churned butter. I may have made that last part up, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if that was the case. It was very soft and melty. 

As I sat there, I texted pictures of my food and the menu to my wife who has already declared her love for the fried green tomato eggs benedict, even tho she hasn&#39;t had it yet. But she is determined to try it within the next three days. Because fried green tomatoes=everything.

All in all, I loved everything about Buttermilk and hope you do too. I can&#39;t wait to go back, but please save me a chair at your table because I know after reading this review you&#39;re all going to want to go there and I kind of don&#39;t want to share how awesome this place is with the world.

Their staff is so attentive!  We&#39;ve had refills tended to quickly, food arrives hot and plates are cleared promptly. It&#39;s a great breakfast spot!  

A few favorites include the s&#39;mores hot chocolate, their bacon, the banoffee pie and their chocolately goodness waffle.  For the waffle, I would get the almond butter on the side next time as I think it may be unnecessary but I cannot confirm my hunch at this point.

I&#39;ve been here a quite a few times with mixed impressions, not my go-to but a solid option. 

(+) This place is trendy (which, for some, could be a negative). It&#39;s large, clean, and thoughtfully decorated, but loud. There&#39;s a fun coffee bar with fancy-schmancy lattes, if that&#39;s your jam. There&#39;s also a nice drink list and some cool champagne/juice options for groups. 

(+) The menu is an overwhelming array of curious and adventurous options as well as some standby classics. An argument could certainly be made that the menu is a bit too expansive or overwhelming. But, as a typical American, I love me some choices! (Do I need a side of banoffee pie pancakes and a butterscotch latte? Duh.)

(+/-) Service is rushed but generally attentive and helpful. I have had visits where this is not the case, so it&#39;s inconsistent, often based on customer volumes. Most recently, impressions have been positive. 

(+/-) I&#39;ve had awesome (and correspondingly priced) dishes as well as some disappointing duds. Again, there&#39;s some inconsistency to be ironed out still. I think it&#39;s possible there are too many elaborate items that just can&#39;t be consistently executed.

We have found that the quality and taste of the the food has improved as well as the service. It is often quite busy, but they have a decent amount of seating while you&#39;re waiting. The biscuits are quite good now, so much that I ordered the biscuits and chicken and gravy, which is not something that I normally order. Food in generally is pretty good, and you get a TON of it. 

We last went in January, but there were TONS of flies inside. Not house flies, but fruit flies/gnats. While eating, I noticed that there was one pesky fly that I just couldn&#39;t kill. Once I got it, it seemed to regenerate. Closer to the end of my meal, I noticed the glass from the window behind me was covered in gnats..probably 15-20. The waitress seemed unimpressed that we spent some time killing the flies. Honestly, aside from the flies, we had a good experience. There are 2 things I just cannot stand. Hair and bugs. In my food. Ok, neither were in my food, but having the flies flying around my food the entire time was kind of a mood killer.",12/03/16,127,3,1,2,5,1.8504000000000005,1.622,0.531,12.847000000000001,No,1151
buttermilk-geneva,Serianna T.,k6vOe0_qglL2PZlBldoKeQ,K7xQFs79Ze6-uZ5Z46R4QQ,"We were in town for a wedding when the Boy saw Buttermilk and declared we would be eating there for breakfast the next day.  We called ahead at 9:30 and they had a 30 min wait and did not accept call ahead for the wait list.  By the time we got there, the wait was 45 min but we were sat with in 30 min.

The menu is impressive and hard to pick down to just one item but I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken under the Biscuits section and also ordered a Blood Mary.  The bloody was a little too pepper focused for my liking vs horseradish.  The Boy&#39;s eyes were as big as his stomach and he wanted to order an entrÌ©e AND an order of pancakes.  Thankfully Buttermilk allows you to upgrade your pancakes with any order and he got the Eggs Your Way + Meat and upgraded to the Oats &#39;N Chocolate pancakes.

I wanted to love my dish, the dish was a massive portion and the chicken was nicely seasoned.  The biscuits themselves were very dry and weren&#39;t all that great.  The 2 eggs that came with I ordered poached and asked for a side of Hollandaise to dip.  The hollandaise arrived and was very runny, more of the consistency of melted butter so I was very glad I didn&#39;t go the bene route. The Boy was happy with his dish and we both loved the pancakes.  Normally I don&#39;t like oat pancakes but the oats added a nice crunch to the cakes, the smaller cakes were good but I don&#39;t think I could eat a full order with as much chocolate as they put on them.

Customer service was definitely lacking.  We were hung up on when we called the first time before we could ask our 2nd question and had to call back.  I understand you are busy but a little tact goes a long way.  Our server was nice but not exactly friendly, and a server at a neighboring table dropped a syrup carafe that shattered and got syrup down my pant leg. The syrup on the floor was cleaned up but my sticky pant leg and the broken carafe pieces that went under my chair went unnoticed.

Fast forward to today. I went and picked him up and said where to? &#34;Geneva.&#34;  Now we don&#39;t live too far, but I was a little pissy at a 30 minute drive to get breakfast. I have a few spots near me that are excellent. 

We get here and the wait is super short even for a Sunday morning. I ordered the giant ball of breakfast, and it was incredible. There was biscuits and gravy and sausage and cheese and eggs. Wow. It was a total foodgasm. Hey served potatoes on the side with it. Which had little pieces of ham and pepper and had some cheese on top. Not a ton, but enough to make it a delicious garnish. 

My buddy got these cinnamon roll pancakes on the side with his chicken fried chicken. He literally forced me to have some of the pancakes, and I will say that I was absolutely stupid for trying to turn them down in the first place.

The place wasn&#39;t too crowded so it wasn&#39;t overly noisy which I assume is typical on the weekend and what other reviews have said. 

I ordered a caramel latte to drink and my boyfriend ordered the coffee, both tasted great and the coffee came with a decanter so you could refill yourself. 

We both ordered off the lunch menu, I got the pig and fig sandwich with regular fries. The sandwich was just okay for my taste, between the fig preserve spread and melted brie cheese I thought it would make for a special sandwich but the ham just tasted like lunch meat ham you would get at the store (hence the 4 stars), it would have perfect if they had used ham off the bone like in one of their other sandwiches, that is if you like a sweet and salty combo! 

My boyfriend ordered the DLT sandwich which is DUCK BACON, yes you hear me, and it was just as delicious as it sounds. He added avocado for $1 and also got the sweet potato fries which were nice, thick and crispy! 

Our waitress was very friendly and attentive contrary to other reviews I&#39;ve read.

I know these cute kitschy breakfast-and-lunch only places are kind of a dime a dozen these days, but I LIVE for brunch and so on my day off, my mom and I went and tried this place out. Here&#39;s what made it so awesome:

-HUGE coffee menu. This is not your standard regular-or-decaf. With a full espresso bar and a ton of fancy choices, you can&#39;t go wrong ordering a delicious speciality drink. I got a cookie butter latte which was rich, decadent, and so tasty. 
-Tons of menu options, with not a lot of weird or plain stuff you&#39;d never actually order.
-Their speciality is biscuits, which is a pretty fun thing to make your selling point. Us northerners don&#39;t really see a ton of interesting biscuit options.
-The portions. Are. Enormous. Seriously I can eat a LOT of brunch, and I struggled to get through my meal. My mom barely made it halfway through hers.
-I got the chicken fried chicken skillet which was UHHHHHMAZING. A huge piece of chicken fried chicken, bacon, sausage, ham, cheese, onion and peppers covered in sausage gravy and two eggs. Not for every day. So worth it.
-For an up charge, you can get a specialty pancake as your side instead of plain. I got the cinnamon roll pancakes which were soooooo good. Way too sweet to be your main meal unless you&#39;re a huge sugar fan, but amazing as a small side option. 
-PRICES. Are you kidding me with the prices? That huge skillet I got which had every ingredient under the sun? ELEVEN BUCKS. Way further east, that would be $15 and half as huge/good. With fundrinks, skillet, a Benedict for my mom, the specialty cakes, our total was seriously like $35. Awesome.

After finishing a 5K in Geneva, my friend and I wanted to go to brunch.  This place looked cute and appealing from the outside so we decided to give it a try.  There were people waiting outside, so it had to be good, right?!
We were told there was a 30-35 minute wait and given a buzzer which we could take a half mile from the place.  We walked around the area to kill time, only to wait closer to 45 minutes.  Sometimes places over exaggerate, sometimes under... And really, what breakfast place isn&#39;t crowded on a Sunday morning??? We were fine waiting.
I had just finished a 90 day challenge at my gym the day before so the last thing I wanted was boring ol&#39; egg whites with spinach or that nonsense...I was totally down with something more exciting, and well...even not-so-healthy while I take a few days &#34;break&#34; to do some indulging before getting back on that wagon!  This was the perfect place to do that.
I flipped that menu back and forth having no clue what to order, EVERYTHING looked good... red velvet french toast? crepes?  I settled on the oatmeal strawberry chocolate pancakes, which I put a dent in, and took the rest home.  My friend and I also ordered a side of bacon which was really delicious, very little fat on it, and not greasy at all.
They also have an extensive list of coffee on their menu, as well as bloody marys, mimosas, you name it.  This is brunch heaven.

What I really appreciated is that they give you extra water and a small coffee pot to refill your coffee without having to wait for your server.

buttermilk-geneva,Olivia B.,6NQAoeUgsxoAr31NVJGxTw,KrEuDjqfXsmSSYekQp6oAQ,"Just like everyone else, we were excited to give this new restaurant a try. We went on a Friday around 11:30 AM. We were told a 25 minute wait from a hostess, but it turned out to only be about 10 minutes, if that. It wasn&#39;t bad at all.

Our food came relatively quickly considering how busy the place was. Our waitress never stopped by during our meal, and we had to ask other servers/busboys for things, which was fine I guess.

The food: 

I had the Goat Omelette -- an omelette with chicken sausage, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, and herbed goat cheese. Literally was SMOTHERED on the inside with the goat cheese, which was so crazy over powering it was nauseating. Then there was a big dollop of the cheese on the top of the omelette, too. Imagine eating spoonfuls for herbed goat cheese. That&#39;s what this tasted like. The multigrain toast was a nice thick piece. The potatoes had no flavor at all so we added salt and hot sauce and ate maybe half. Wish I&#39;d had the option for hash browns instead.

Like everyone else said, it was pretty expensive, too. $10.99 for that omelette, the bland potatoes, and one piece of toast. 

Friend had the Red Rooster Skillet -- pretty cool presentation in the skillet pan but she said it was a bit difficult to eat because of this. She liked it for the most part. 

The longest time we spent waiting was after we were done eating it took about 25  minutes for our waitress to drop off our check and get it taken care of. Our waitress knew the service was not good as she apologized for not checking in on us more when she dropped off the check and saw me reaching for the comment card.

We stopped in on a Monday morning (no school for students) to check it out- and we were so glad we got there before 9 am as it got crazy busy with a wait after that. We started out with their basket of biscuits- and ours were absolutely delicious. Perfectly browned on the top, still warm and moist- and the jam and honey butter went perfectly with them. We realized afterwards that we didn&#39;t need them due to the large portion sizes- but we were glad we tried them as they are a house specialty. 

Each of us tried something different for breakfast- a chicken fried chicken skillet, their breakfast sandwich that is smothered in gravy, and their cinnamon roll pumpkin pancakes (seasonal)- we all loved our dishes, and every single one of us had at least one meal of leftovers. For us the food was excellent and the service was good which is why I&#39;m going with 4 stars. I loved the space itself- and I would definitely return in the future.

It tastes like every other typical suburban breakfast restaurant. It doesn&#39;t stand out at all. I ordered the chicken fried chicken skillet which was a surprise to see on a menu in the nothern US. The chicken was bland and the luckily the gravy and the other flavors from the skillet helped, but overall it was just ok. Wasn&#39;t bad.....wasn&#39;t fantastic. The pancakes on the side tasked like they came out of a box. For me pancakes are special and when breakfast restaurants don&#39;t make a really good pancake it&#39;s almost insulting. 

I also ordered a dopio espresso. I will admit to being a coffee snob. I knew it was going to be a problem when I walked in and noticed the Nespresso machine. I will leave it at that.

The filet mignon skillet was very cheesy( which is great) but the meat had no flavor. The honey bun pancakes were phenomenal, but the cinnamon bun ones needed a little more cream cheese icing to complete the wow factor.

I had the fried green tomato Benedict which was fabulous. The Remoulade Hollandaise is a bit spicy, so be forewarned. (I think I&#39;ll ask for the plain Hollandaise next time; the spice tends to overpower the flavor of the tomatoes.) I paid the extra $2 for the farmhouse potatoes, well worth it. 

We like our coffee a bit strong, so the coffee was too weak for our taste. It&#39;s hard to find a breakfast restaurant with strong coffee. 

Prices are comparable to Egg Harbor and the food is a little better, in my opinion.

buttermilk-geneva,Adam B.,QPPRfD8JxPypOgIP2ekTTQ,mtFXj84DQQ0S_SNDjOrhHg,"I sincerely hope this place lasts. But to be honest, with Egg Harbor Cafe and a few other breakfast places in downtown Geneva, wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to open in St. Charles or Batavia? 

That aside, let&#39;s get to the food. The orange-strawberry juice was certainly fresh and quite enjoyable. I like pulp in my juice and this was a little smoother than what I was hoping for. Still tasted good. We also got a biscuit and this was not like a typical dry round biscuit. It was more of an oval shape and they had a tangier taste than what I&#39;m used to. With some whipped butter and a little honey, it was quite good. 

Then I had the Mountain house skillet with scrambled eggs, wild mushrooms, caramelized onions, sautÌ©ed spinach, hickory smoked bacon, cheddar and jack cheese. I never expected a portion quite this large. It came in a big steel bowl, which was cool. All the ingredients complemented each other incredibly well. The one thing I could have used was some avocado. The potatoes were fine, but they could have been a little crispier. On the side, I got the lemon-blueberry pancakes. I&#39;m not a pancake guy at all, but I figured this was the place to give one a shot. I got two cakes with berries, plus blueberry syrup, and powdered sugar. The berry flavor was strong, not overwhelming. And the hint of lemon flavor in the pancake helped cut the sweetness of the blueberries, so the combination works well.

The service was fine, the food tasted good, and the presentation was nice as well. Prices are a bit high; I mean, who would want to spend $5.00 for a bowl of berries?

buttermilk-geneva,Leslie S.,rbQp0U49dlq-IcC9d3uBdw,a8nkOUqeW7hBZrAdOCL8Qw,"Once you get past the cute decor, Buttermilk is basically a very average brunch place in Geneva. 

After waiting more than a half hour for a table before asking if we were still on the list, we were finally seated near the window toward the back of the restaurant. The service, as many have said, is spotty. Our waitress was not particularly attentive, and in fact missed something quite significant, which I will explain in just a second. Let&#39;s talk first about the food: I ordered biscuits with jam to start, followed by a veggie omelette with potatoes and buttermilk pancakes. Like so many brunch restaurants, the portions were huge. In fact, they really were too big. I never did touch the buttermilk pancakes, as the biscuits and omelets were plenty. What was interesting about the food though, is that all of it was cooked in far too much butter! I know what you are thinking; you are thinking, &#34;Leslie, please, the place is called Buttermilk. Of course everything is drowned in butter!&#34; But butter and buttermilk are two different things, and although Julia Child may have been a proponent of butter, even she would think this restaurant was using too much. The butter in the biscuits, particularly, overwhelms any honey flavor that might be in there. 

I said that we would return to the topic of service, and so we shall. My husband does not like butter; he is not lactose intolerant, but has similar reactions to butter in particular. He mentioned his aversion to butter to the waitress when we asked about the biscuits. She was very upfront and explained that the biscuits were coated in a buttery mix before they even went into the oven. What&#39;s strange though, is that she did not mention the fact the corned beef my husband was also ordering was covered in butter as well. In fact, the corned beef had such a strong butter flavor, my husband could not actually eat it. This would have been a helpful tip when ordering, as he could have asked that the corned beef be cooked in olive oil, which one might expect anyway.

So overall, I am not in a big rush to return to Buttermilk. I could get the same quality food from several other restaurants down the street, perhaps with better service and shorter wait times. More importantly, the food will not be slathered in butter.",09/05/15,255,2,2,3,20,2.1329,1.653,0.9629999999999999,20.383,No,2301

buttermilk-geneva,Alina N.,k2pzEPRewHv6I2Ccjg00nQ,2GAPt7dQw3Oql9iGuYmALA,"First time at any Buttermilk and the experience was ruined. The carelessness of the management and the server was so unpleasant it overshadowed the good food.

First off, we were a table of 4 and a toddler. We ordered our drinks and one of the coffee mugs had lipstick still on it. We brushed it off and asked for a new one. Then we ordered, when the orders came out 3 out of 4 breakfast plates were wrong! We still didn&#39;t make a big deal about it since they were almost similar to what we originally ordered. We asked for bacon and the brought us a nice COLD plate of chopped up bacon! The plate was warmer than the bacon! To top it all off when we split the check and gave our credit cards they charged the wrong bill to the cards. 

Out of respect to the many servers and people working for tips we left 15% but our waitress didn&#39;t deserve more than $4 based on her carelessness but she did let management know and what&#39;s worse is they completely avoided speaking to us and at least apologizing. The place was not overly busy there was an entire wing with open tables so they have no excuse for they mishap. 

Being such a new business you would expect them to be a little more carefully and a little more courteous.

Everyone/place has a bad day so I hope this isn&#39;t the norm, though.  I will say the menu looks good &amp; they have some damn tasty buttermilk biscuits. My Mountain House Skillet was delicious as well.  But, the Hubs pancakes (just regular buttermilk, nothin&#39; fancy) needed another minute or two on the griddle - they were still a bit doughy on the inside. Considering the place is called Buttermilk one would think they&#39;d have the timing of how long the pancakes have to be on the griddle down.  Perhaps it was because one pancake was huge and the other was small in the short stack of 2 pancakes (small pancake hidden on the bottom).

The service was not great, either. All the bus boys were smiling but we didn&#39;t see a single server or hostess actually smile while we were there. Geesh, I realize it was a busy Saturday morning but c&#39;mon... And the syrup carafe that our server dropped off had a bunch of syrup running down half of it, something I doubt they could have missed - perhaps a minor detail and something I&#39;d expect at Denny&#39;s but at this place I would hope they&#39;d take the time to wipe these things off before giving them to the next customer. When it was time to pay the check my husband put his credit card in the holder &amp; then went to use the restroom. Our server came &amp; picked it up &amp; then dropped it back off (before he returned), setting it right in front of me and said, &#34;This is all set for you to sign.&#34; Clearly she hadn&#39;t even bothered looking at the name on the card or she would have known it was my husband&#39;s card (not a gender neutral name by any means) - disconcerting in this age of continual credit card fraud.

Our server was prompt to assist us once we were seated. We ordered fresh squeezed orange juice, which was good, but I prefer another restaurant up the street when it comes to fresh OJ. We ordered Banana Toffee Pancakes (not sure what the actual name was) which were amazing. We also ordered Eggs Benedict with Pulled Pork, amazing.

They have light and fluffy pancakes, waffles, and french toast, along with a great menu where everyone can find something to enjoy. The only problem is that depending on what day and time you get there, the wait is about 30-75 minutes, so be sure to plan accordingly if you decide to come here, which I highly recommend (It&#39;s worth the wait!!!). Even if you have a long wait, Buttermilk is in downtown Geneva, so you can walk around, do some shopping, or just enjoy the view of the river.

buttermilk-geneva,Eddie C.,hsRDBVC9Bi4SR7NSUKTwEw,ZaLBuVwaelQMnWWxtk-Qrw,"What a mess this place is. Opening week, thursday about noon. Me and a guest walked in and the place was slammed, at least 20+ people waiting for tables. I counted 6 open tables and booths and yet no one was being seated. We were greeted by a stressed out fossil at the hostess station and told the wait would be about 15-20 minutes. We were sat sometime in that time frame but literally watched 5 groups of people walk out in that time, which is a shame because there were places for them to sit, but a couple unorganized hostess missed them.

Anyways we sat down and our server came in a timely manner. Although we didnt get any, they have a pretty extensive coffee menu that looked like it would satisfy any run of the mill starbucks order.

I ordered the croque monseur with the egg and side of apples with honey and cinnamon. My date ordered the red rooster skillet with pancakes. 16 minute ticket time I felt was reasonable considering how slammed they were.

The croque monseur was out of this world. It was soooo friggin good. One of the absolute best breakfast menu items ive ever had. The apples complimented it well and tasted great too. 

My date really liked her skillet as well and from what i tasted it was great. The pancake was really good as well. Definitely above average.

All in all it took about an hour to be seated, get our food then check and leave. I cant really dock them any stars for the sub-par service others were getting but there wasnt really a time where people were waiting for tables and there were empty tables available. The table behind me sat empty for 10 minutes before someone was seated. If the geriatric and the bubble head at the station get their stuff together this could be the best breakfast spot in the fox valley. Seriously.

Ill definitely be back, definitely recommend to everyone including families with kids (they had a kids menu), and definitely hope they get their management situation fixed so they stay for a while.

I like that it&#39;s a small, family owned restaurant. That usually means either the food is really good... or really bad... after all the recommendations and reading the reviews and seeing the pictures, I decided that it would be really good!

Ummmm... I was really disappointed. Did I even go to the same place as everyone else?? :/

The guy who was serving us seemed incredibly uninterested and it looked like he didn&#39;t want to be there. He came to our table and I asked for a few min to decide what to order and I felt like he got annoyed?? Already the mood of the meal was ruined by then &amp; we just sat down... I wanted to walk out, but I tried to stay positive and I kinda drove far to get there so I figured if the food was as good as the reviews say, it will be worth it. 

We ordered combination pho, beef jerky, and papaya salad. Initially, I told the server I wanted spicy papaya salad. He basically made me feel like we couldn&#39;t handle spicy. He said that if it was too hot, they can&#39;t change it once it comes out.... ok...? I was told spicy has 10-12 chilies in it, as opposed to the medium, which only has 5. I ended up getting medium because I had a feeling the portion would be small anyway...

The beef jerky came out. It was a very small portion. Not worth the $9.50. I guess it was good that it was fresh and hot, but other than that, nothing special. It was just salty.

The papaya salad portion was also very small. It was close to $9. I didn&#39;t think it was worth it. I thought it would be fishy, stinky, spicy, salty, sweet, sour, just how I like it. This was mostly salty and spicy. Also, it didn&#39;t have just 5 chilies. It for sure had way more than that (more like 10-12). Not sure if he accidentally ordered spicy or what, but it wasn&#39;t medium. I figured, maybe it was medium and he explained to me wrong. Who knows? I didn&#39;t mind the heat level. I like spicy food and spicy papaya salad, I just didn&#39;t expect it. I was told it was lao style, but I&#39;ve had lao style papaya salad many times. This definitely wasn&#39;t it. 

The combination pho was also a very small portion. Usually when you get pho, there&#39;s a lot of noodles at least, so you leave with a full belly of noodles. This was skimpy on noodles, meat, seafood, everything. I didn&#39;t like that they used imitation crab meat. The broth tasted like a watered down veggie broth or something. There was nothing meaty or rich or flavorful about it. Not worth the $9+ at all.

The guy came to fill our water (even though our cups were full) and it felt like he basically came over to scoff at us for the spicy papaya salad. He asked if it was too spicy and that this is only medium and I wanted spicy. Like wtf?

He didn&#39;t check up on us or even look over our way after that. When we were done with our food and wanted to pay, he was at the register on his phone.

I don&#39;t expect really good service from asian restaurants, but this experience was just bizarre.

The service sucked, the food was overpriced, portions are tiny. I&#39;ve had plenty of homemade Laos food and this wasn&#39;t anything like it. Idk why I thought that since it&#39;s in Elgin (not in Chicago), it would be reasonably priced. It was actually the opposite. I really wanted to like this place, but nope.

Let&#39;s start with the food: it is full of flavor, authentic, and fresh. I have never, ever had a bad meal here. 

The service is always friendly. However, they can be a little slllooooooow sometimes. For me, this just gives me more time to converse with my friends and hang out. It doesn&#39;t bother me at all. Others who I have been here with, do complain about it. But this is my review so na na na boo boo.

Fresh
Tasty
Home-made
Family-owned
Friendly
Decent prices
Many people of Asian decent eating there (good sign)
take-out order ready in 10 minutes

The bad:
Hair inside my egg roll (homemade and delicious so shouldn&#39;t complain but...)
Asked for Combo pho without tripe but they forgot to omit the tripe. I get very freaked out even looking at tripe 
No website
No online menu (posted pics here)

The Pho had great flavor (and enough for 2 people) the egg rolls were in my Top 3 of all-time, my daughter loved the chicken wings (which is crazy because they&#39;re just chicken wings but they have some secret seasoning) and the Lo mein is very good!(this is not a typical Chinese restaurant so it&#39;s not the same lo mein you might expect).

No, the White Pearl is not a place to wear a cocktail dress to or anything like that, but the humble location is not indicative of the quality of food in the least. Don&#39;t be a snob. If you like great Asian food you should check it out.

We ordered two different kinds of pho and an order of eggrolls. We had the Thai Iced Coffee to drink as well, and it was excellent. Very strong coffee flavor, with just enough sweetness and milliners. The eggrolls came six to the order and with a sweet vinegary sauce studded with ground peanuts. These were very fresh; you could actually taste the filling inside! The pho came in huge bowls and was accompanied by a plate overflowing with romaine leaves, bean sprouts, chilis, and lime slices. 

Next time I would like to try the Lao sausage and some sticky rice!",21/02/15,129,5,2,5,12,4.6745,2.8010000000000006,0.16799999999999998,10.029000000000002,No,1108

I ordered the pho combination (beef meatballs, pork, chicken, tripe, squid, shrimp) soup. It&#39;s bright, delicious and savory umami wraps around you like a warm hug on a fresh, breezy day. Dip some fresh lettuce in the broth, drop in some crunchy bean sprouts, add a dash of lime and please don&#39;t forget some Siriacha hot sauce (it is beautiful).

All of the other reviewers are correct. The food is amazing -- it&#39;s literally a pearl in a dumpy old Taco Bell. But a few bites into your food and you&#39;ll forget where you are.

Some basic notes: eating pho (pronounced &#34;fuh&#34;) isn&#39;t like eating a regular bowl of soup. Here&#39;s some great tips below:

A Pho Primer
From http://www.phofever.com/primer.php

Resist the urge to dive into your bowl of pho immediately after it is
placed in front of you. A little patience and adherence to the following
will enhance and enlighten your pho experience.

Step One: Season your pho. Lift your spoon and sample the steamy broth. Mmmm. If the broth is a little bland, add a dash of fish sauce. Not too much, just a little at first and more if you need it. Next, add a sprinkle of black pepper and squeeze an entire wedge of lime into your bowl.

Step Two: Add herbs and sprouts. Add about a handful of beansprouts to your pho. Use your chop-sticks to push them down to the bottom of the bowl. Make sure to submerge any pieces of rare beef that are still pink as well. Next, add 10-12 leaves of Thai Basil to your bowl after removing them from the stems. If your pho restaurant serves saw herb, tear 2-3 of them into one inch long pieces and place them in the pho as well. Add 3-4 slices of serrano chili if you enjoy your pho spicy. Alternately, keep the serrano chili to the side for later use.

Step Three: Prepare for dipping. Squeeze some hoisin sauce and sriracha chili into a small saucer. A 50/50 split is recommended, but use less sriracha if you are sensitive to spicy foods. Mix the two sauces together where they meet along the border using the tip of your chopsticks. Take a taste of your creation.

At this point some like to add a splash of hoisin or sriracha chili to the
broth. Purists frown on this practice, but to each his own.

Step Four: Time to eat. You are now ready to enjoy your pho! Use your chopsticks and spoon to evenly mix all the ingredients in your bowl. Pair pieces of beef with Thai basil, saw herb or a slice of serrano chili - dip into the hoisin sauce / siracha chili mixture you made in Step Three. Don&#39;t forget to sip the broth in between bites of noodles and beef. Enjoy!",25/02/11,336,4,1,5,-15,6.8,5.426,0.535,32.03999999999999,No,2644

For the past few years I&#39;ve actually purposefully avoided it.  It looks like a fema trailer ate a taco bell, but I can tell you now from experience--do not judge this book by its cover.

The food is awesome and the servers have charisma. The portion sizes are huge and the windows are drafty. There was also a basketball game from 1985 on the flat screen which add a nice, confusing element to the whole scheme.

It&#39;s priced moderately and is definitely a place I&#39;d come back to....for carry out.",13/01/12,64,3,2,2,26,1.4213999999999998,0.927,0.295,5.7780000000000005,No,593
white-pearl-restaurant-elgin,Matthew K.,715Nhkx5hzTBGLIBpbz6-w,p4Z62h1TAG8ElhTmVymMgA,"I&#39;ve been to White Pearl numerous times.  Whenever I&#39;m in the Elgin area, I always want to make a stop for some authentic Southeast Asian cuisine.

Everything that I&#39;ve sampled here at White Pearl is delicious.  Particular favorites include lap beef, lad na, and eggrolls (they are of the crispy/flaky variety as opposed to the Chinese style).  Occasionally, I order the papaya salad, but it seems like it is way too spicy at times, so I really have to be in the mood to get it.

There are some major let-downs at White Pearl, unfortunately.  For one, the decor is absolutely diabolical.  Even though I&#39;m sure it&#39;s clean, the whole place just looks dingy.  Also, there is no air conditioning--just mini-fans that oscillate and blow napkins, etc. off the table.  Perhaps worst of all, there is a big-screen TV in the dining room which always seems to be under the control of somebody who has odd taste in television-- if the Bulls are playing the Heat, why are we watching &#34;Man vs. Food,&#34; watching some morbidly obese schmuck regurgitate 10 lbs of hot-wings?  Soccer also seems to be a favorite.  Bleh.  In short, it seems that no effort has been put into creating a pleasant dining experience for customers.

Lastly, I&#39;m sad to report that White Pearl recently raised their prices substantially.  Whereas I would have otherwise given White Pearl a 4/5 rating, I must lower it to a 3/5 since the value has been decreased.

I will limit my visits to White Pearl to once or twice a year after the pricing change, especially since there are other good dining options in Elgin.",17/04/12,193,3,1,2,-71,1.5496999999999996,1.7970000000000004,1.02,14.181,No,1604
white-pearl-restaurant-elgin,Robert G.,73iBHSmOomEbjB_vLih8HQ,IJmS6EZf9Cfgrms--iSRqA,"[Prologue] I started this review in Feb 2009, and am now just finishing it after going there again today. [Alrighty then...] This place was recommended to us by friends last year and while a bit far for the suburbs (near Elgin Community College), it&#39;s worth dropping by if in the area. We&#39;ve now been there on a couple occasions and have not been disappointed yet. This place was another restaurant in another life [looks Taco Bell-ish], and the furnishings pretty sparse save the big screen TV [pic]....no worries. The place was actually pretty drafty inside and the bathroom downright chilly. Tables are well spaced [lotsa room] as is the waiter service: order then get food that&#39;s it. Also not a big fan of the plastic chopsticks. No checks, no AMEX. 

This is not strictly Thai, they have a bunch of stuff there and bill themselves as &#34;Authentic Asian Noodle Cuisine&#34;--I would say 1/2 Thai 1/2 Chinese. I was Jonesin&#39; for the Laos Sausage ($6.95 for three) which I remember as being good: and they were again :) Spicy, fresh, and rather large, could actually consider these as a small entree--you&#39;d be missing out if you DIDN&#39;T try these but generally enjoy red meat. Natch, I ordered Pad Kee Mao (Beef, $7.75) with no mushrooms and it was some of the better I had: spiciness was perfect; used red and green hot peppers; Thai Basil and Chinese broccoli; not a lot of residual oil. The spousal unit got the Wonton Soup ($6.50) and it was large, as expected, and rated 8 of 10--guess for a finicky person, that&#39;s a pretty good endorsement. 

There are the token Tom Yum soups, and some rice dishes (mostly pepper or broccoli and XXXX [meat]), but don&#39;t expect a full Thai menu; only one thing is more than a ten-spot. A lot of the people there--probably regulars--seem to get some sort of Pho, so my bet is that&#39;s decent as well. I got my typical Diet Coke ($1.25, no refills) and Pooh got the Thai Iced Coffee-Black ($2.50) which she said was pretty good--I&#39;m not a coffee guy so I didn&#39;t dare try it. The menu is not exhaustive and you won&#39;t get the full restaurant treatment, but the food is tasty, quick, and cheap.",09/01/10,290,4,1,5,2,4.48,1.808,1.152,13.039000000000001,No,2177

For the past few years I&#39;ve actually purposefully avoided it.  It looks like a fema trailer ate a taco bell, but I can tell you now from experience--do not judge this book by its cover.

The food is awesome and the servers have charisma. The portion sizes are huge and the windows are drafty. There was also a basketball game from 1985 on the flat screen which add a nice, confusing element to the whole scheme.

It&#39;s priced moderately and is definitely a place I&#39;d come back to....for carry out.",13/01/12,64,3,2,2,26,1.4213999999999998,0.927,0.295,5.7780000000000005,No,593
white-pearl-restaurant-elgin,Matthew K.,715Nhkx5hzTBGLIBpbz6-w,p4Z62h1TAG8ElhTmVymMgA,"I&#39;ve been to White Pearl numerous times.  Whenever I&#39;m in the Elgin area, I always want to make a stop for some authentic Southeast Asian cuisine.

Everything that I&#39;ve sampled here at White Pearl is delicious.  Particular favorites include lap beef, lad na, and eggrolls (they are of the crispy/flaky variety as opposed to the Chinese style).  Occasionally, I order the papaya salad, but it seems like it is way too spicy at times, so I really have to be in the mood to get it.

There are some major let-downs at White Pearl, unfortunately.  For one, the decor is absolutely diabolical.  Even though I&#39;m sure it&#39;s clean, the whole place just looks dingy.  Also, there is no air conditioning--just mini-fans that oscillate and blow napkins, etc. off the table.  Perhaps worst of all, there is a big-screen TV in the dining room which always seems to be under the control of somebody who has odd taste in television-- if the Bulls are playing the Heat, why are we watching &#34;Man vs. Food,&#34; watching some morbidly obese schmuck regurgitate 10 lbs of hot-wings?  Soccer also seems to be a favorite.  Bleh.  In short, it seems that no effort has been put into creating a pleasant dining experience for customers.

Lastly, I&#39;m sad to report that White Pearl recently raised their prices substantially.  Whereas I would have otherwise given White Pearl a 4/5 rating, I must lower it to a 3/5 since the value has been decreased.

I will limit my visits to White Pearl to once or twice a year after the pricing change, especially since there are other good dining options in Elgin.",17/04/12,193,3,1,2,-71,1.5496999999999996,1.7970000000000004,1.02,14.181,No,1604
white-pearl-restaurant-elgin,Robert G.,73iBHSmOomEbjB_vLih8HQ,IJmS6EZf9Cfgrms--iSRqA,"[Prologue] I started this review in Feb 2009, and am now just finishing it after going there again today. [Alrighty then...] This place was recommended to us by friends last year and while a bit far for the suburbs (near Elgin Community College), it&#39;s worth dropping by if in the area. We&#39;ve now been there on a couple occasions and have not been disappointed yet. This place was another restaurant in another life [looks Taco Bell-ish], and the furnishings pretty sparse save the big screen TV [pic]....no worries. The place was actually pretty drafty inside and the bathroom downright chilly. Tables are well spaced [lotsa room] as is the waiter service: order then get food that&#39;s it. Also not a big fan of the plastic chopsticks. No checks, no AMEX. 

This is not strictly Thai, they have a bunch of stuff there and bill themselves as &#34;Authentic Asian Noodle Cuisine&#34;--I would say 1/2 Thai 1/2 Chinese. I was Jonesin&#39; for the Laos Sausage ($6.95 for three) which I remember as being good: and they were again :) Spicy, fresh, and rather large, could actually consider these as a small entree--you&#39;d be missing out if you DIDN&#39;T try these but generally enjoy red meat. Natch, I ordered Pad Kee Mao (Beef, $7.75) with no mushrooms and it was some of the better I had: spiciness was perfect; used red and green hot peppers; Thai Basil and Chinese broccoli; not a lot of residual oil. The spousal unit got the Wonton Soup ($6.50) and it was large, as expected, and rated 8 of 10--guess for a finicky person, that&#39;s a pretty good endorsement. 

There are the token Tom Yum soups, and some rice dishes (mostly pepper or broccoli and XXXX [meat]), but don&#39;t expect a full Thai menu; only one thing is more than a ten-spot. A lot of the people there--probably regulars--seem to get some sort of Pho, so my bet is that&#39;s decent as well. I got my typical Diet Coke ($1.25, no refills) and Pooh got the Thai Iced Coffee-Black ($2.50) which she said was pretty good--I&#39;m not a coffee guy so I didn&#39;t dare try it. The menu is not exhaustive and you won&#39;t get the full restaurant treatment, but the food is tasty, quick, and cheap.",09/01/10,290,4,1,5,2,4.48,1.808,1.152,13.039000000000001,No,2177

white-pearl-restaurant-elgin,Rich C.,upGM6Xy9xakdf1J65gnFSw,ak_V2RpYp-u3rEOHma-LgQ,"My first memory of this place was looking at the old Taco Bell building they reside in with a dubious eye... then opening the door and having the most delicious scents waft out!

The food is excellent, authentic, good quality food. The Laos Sausages are incredibly tasty, the Pho is really good, and they have the best Pad Thai I&#39;ve eaten. The beef jerky is just like the jerky I used to make at home, and very tasty. Add a side of sticky rice and some of the tastiest won-ton soup you&#39;ve ever had and it&#39;s a great meal.

The downsides are the dine-in atmosphere is really bad. It&#39;s a revamped Taco Bell that looks like someone just tossed a coat of paint on and threw some old tables they had in their basement around. It&#39;s not the best environment for eating in. I usually do take out, however, so this doesn&#39;t bother me very much, but it&#39;s worth mentioning for those looking for a good dine-in experience.

The other downside is the food is EXPENSIVE. While it&#39;s generally worth it, the cost is somewhat prohibitive, and someone used to other takeout places may well get some sticker shock. I think the value is pretty good overall, and the quality is top-notch, but price and value are a factor.

We were immediately greeted and got to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  No fancy table settings, just the necessities napkins, spicy hot sauce, and soy sauce.  Food arrived in a timely manner, considering there were eight of us.

      Okay now I could not resist.  If you get it, then you&#39;ll get this place.  If not  let em draw you the picture. 
   Imagine if you will an old Taco Bell building from the 80&#39;s, the same shape but no Taco Bell colors.  On the inside the resemeblence falls completely off.  You are there amongst a sea of non-white folks (this is a very good sign). On each tbale is Siricha (a.k.a. Cock Sauce), chopsticks, asian spoons, soy sauce, chili peppers in oil, hoison sauce, etc. 

      The food is very good, authentic asian cusisine here.  
Appetizers of note:  
   Laos Sausage (picture above from previous yelper).  These things are interesting.  Note I didn&#39;t say delicious but the flavor palaate is so unique I irder thenm  every time I being someone new.  I think I appreciate them on a different level each timeI try them.  
    Egg Rolls* are good - thin crispy, pork and noodles on the inside - you get 6 of these wto an order and the peanut sauce they are served with relaly make them sing.  

Entrees of Note:
   The Pad Thai is the most authientic you will find - I reccomend the beef myself and extra, extra spicy.  It has an awesome &#39;unnatural-natural&#39; sheen to them that most white eyes are nto so familiar with now-a-days.  MSG!  Yeah that&#39;s right i said it and meant it! (read the data folks this is nowhere near as nasty as reputed). 

   The Fried Rice - very tasty and fulof wonderful yummy whatever you get in there (chicken, veggies, bbq pork, etc.  

   The Pho - Okay white people say it like the work above that is how it is pronounced. It is awesome.  If you do not know what pho is then you are in for a treat.  You see France tried to tkae over Vietnam a few years back (see Vietnam War for reference material) and being that the greatest spoil of war is delicious food this dish was born - a mixture of an old vietnamese dish with heavy french influences equates to an amazing broth served with noodles and a ton of throw them in yourself other options, cabbage, bean sprouts, chilis, etc.  Trust me it is Phoking good!  You also get to choose the meats you want in your Pho - go bold and try the combination - the &#39;meatballs&#39; are not quite liek anythign I have ever had before and give a very nice fatty flavor to the Pho.  The seafood is alsways fresh in taste and never ppor smelling.  A nice touch (the squid strips  honestly does leave a it to be desired).  

Price:
   Cheap baby - rela cheap!

The thing about this place is that they don&#39;t only serve Thai food, some of their dishes lean towards teh Laos, Vietnamese and Chinese sides. All of which are very good. It&#39;s also a mom &amp; pop joint from what I can tell. The kids run the front end of the restaurant and the parents are in the back cooking and preparing the food. 

The food is excellent here. As the other reviewer had mention their Pho is awesome! In case you don&#39;t know what Pho isLarge portions, savory broth. If you&#39;re not into Pho try their Wonton noodle soup also very good.

If you&#39;re not into soup try their main entrees. Start off with their chicken wing appetizer. The wings are huge and spiced with asian spices and deep fried. If you&#39;re a little more adventurous try the papaya salad. It&#39;s usually spicy so ask for a mild spiciness if you can&#39;t handle the heat. Also try the sticky rice with one of the chicken wings. In fact you can probably make an entire meal out of the sticky rice and chicken wings or fried beef. The sticky rice comes in a little colorful bamboo container and you&#39;re suppose to use your fingers to scoup out the rice and eat it. This is ok, that&#39;s how they do it in Thailand. 

Try the Ladna or Pad See-euw they are one of my favorite dishes. Most Thai places americanize it too much and they end up being too sweet or too bland. Here it is cooked how it&#39;s suppose to be cooked.

Lastly, they don&#39;t serve dessert here but try their ice coffee or ice tea. Both are awesome. 

The service here is very good. Smiles all around. 

The restaurant itself looks like it might have been an old Taco Bell or something that was converted into a restaurant. The decor he is pretty bland but it looks like they are sprucing it up a bit. They have a huge TV screen inside in case someone wants to watch sports or catch-up on Heros.

I&#39;m half Thai half Laos so I think i have a pretty good knowledge of how Thai/Laos homecooking is like.

The food is excellent, authentic, good quality food. The Laos Sausages are incredibly tasty, the Pho is really good, and they have the best Pad Thai I&#39;ve eaten. The beef jerky is just like the jerky I used to make at home, and very tasty. Add a side of sticky rice and some of the tastiest won-ton soup you&#39;ve ever had and it&#39;s a great meal.

The downsides are the dine-in atmosphere is really bad. It&#39;s a revamped Taco Bell that looks like someone just tossed a coat of paint on and threw some old tables they had in their basement around. It&#39;s not the best environment for eating in. I usually do take out, however, so this doesn&#39;t bother me very much, but it&#39;s worth mentioning for those looking for a good dine-in experience.

The other downside is the food is EXPENSIVE. While it&#39;s generally worth it, the cost is somewhat prohibitive, and someone used to other takeout places may well get some sticker shock. I think the value is pretty good overall, and the quality is top-notch, but price and value are a factor.

If you&#39;re looking for ambiance, this isn&#39;t for you, it&#39;s not a wham-bam in your face decor, which I could care less for as long as there&#39;s good food.  Set in an old Taco Bell building, there&#39;s no more than about ten tables.

We were immediately greeted and got to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  No fancy table settings, just the necessities napkins, spicy hot sauce, and soy sauce.  Food arrived in a timely manner, considering there were eight of us.

I&#39;m not a big Pho fan, so I opted for a favorite of mine, Beef Pad See Ew.  Prices are great for the quality AND the quantity.  No complaints here.

The phÌ_ has a great blend of ingredients, so it&#39;s very flavorful and the broth will help clear any cold or hang over and it&#39;s damn delicious too! The next thing I get is the lad nah. When I say I get it crispy I mean they deep fry the noodle for you and pour the gravy over the noodles. This is to die for and the texture is awesome!

      Okay now I could not resist.  If you get it, then you&#39;ll get this place.  If not  let em draw you the picture. 
   Imagine if you will an old Taco Bell building from the 80&#39;s, the same shape but no Taco Bell colors.  On the inside the resemeblence falls completely off.  You are there amongst a sea of non-white folks (this is a very good sign). On each tbale is Siricha (a.k.a. Cock Sauce), chopsticks, asian spoons, soy sauce, chili peppers in oil, hoison sauce, etc. 

      The food is very good, authentic asian cusisine here.  
Appetizers of note:  
   Laos Sausage (picture above from previous yelper).  These things are interesting.  Note I didn&#39;t say delicious but the flavor palaate is so unique I irder thenm  every time I being someone new.  I think I appreciate them on a different level each timeI try them.  
    Egg Rolls* are good - thin crispy, pork and noodles on the inside - you get 6 of these wto an order and the peanut sauce they are served with relaly make them sing.  

Entrees of Note:
   The Pad Thai is the most authientic you will find - I reccomend the beef myself and extra, extra spicy.  It has an awesome &#39;unnatural-natural&#39; sheen to them that most white eyes are nto so familiar with now-a-days.  MSG!  Yeah that&#39;s right i said it and meant it! (read the data folks this is nowhere near as nasty as reputed). 

   The Fried Rice - very tasty and fulof wonderful yummy whatever you get in there (chicken, veggies, bbq pork, etc.  

   The Pho - Okay white people say it like the work above that is how it is pronounced. It is awesome.  If you do not know what pho is then you are in for a treat.  You see France tried to tkae over Vietnam a few years back (see Vietnam War for reference material) and being that the greatest spoil of war is delicious food this dish was born - a mixture of an old vietnamese dish with heavy french influences equates to an amazing broth served with noodles and a ton of throw them in yourself other options, cabbage, bean sprouts, chilis, etc.  Trust me it is Phoking good!  You also get to choose the meats you want in your Pho - go bold and try the combination - the &#39;meatballs&#39; are not quite liek anythign I have ever had before and give a very nice fatty flavor to the Pho.  The seafood is alsways fresh in taste and never ppor smelling.  A nice touch (the squid strips  honestly does leave a it to be desired).  

Price:
   Cheap baby - rela cheap!

We also ordered lao beef jerky which went great with sticky rice.  The place doesn&#39;t look like much but the food is the closest to authentic. 

The second visit, I once again had Pho but it was saltier and I also tried the laos sausage with sticky rice  which was also very salty.  The pat thai is great, it is less greasy than most places which I prefer.  Would I stop by here again? Definitely a yes!

The thing about this place is that they don&#39;t only serve Thai food, some of their dishes lean towards teh Laos, Vietnamese and Chinese sides. All of which are very good. It&#39;s also a mom &amp; pop joint from what I can tell. The kids run the front end of the restaurant and the parents are in the back cooking and preparing the food. 

The food is excellent here. As the other reviewer had mention their Pho is awesome! In case you don&#39;t know what Pho isLarge portions, savory broth. If you&#39;re not into Pho try their Wonton noodle soup also very good.

If you&#39;re not into soup try their main entrees. Start off with their chicken wing appetizer. The wings are huge and spiced with asian spices and deep fried. If you&#39;re a little more adventurous try the papaya salad. It&#39;s usually spicy so ask for a mild spiciness if you can&#39;t handle the heat. Also try the sticky rice with one of the chicken wings. In fact you can probably make an entire meal out of the sticky rice and chicken wings or fried beef. The sticky rice comes in a little colorful bamboo container and you&#39;re suppose to use your fingers to scoup out the rice and eat it. This is ok, that&#39;s how they do it in Thailand. 

Try the Ladna or Pad See-euw they are one of my favorite dishes. Most Thai places americanize it too much and they end up being too sweet or too bland. Here it is cooked how it&#39;s suppose to be cooked.

Lastly, they don&#39;t serve dessert here but try their ice coffee or ice tea. Both are awesome. 

The service here is very good. Smiles all around. 

The restaurant itself looks like it might have been an old Taco Bell or something that was converted into a restaurant. The decor he is pretty bland but it looks like they are sprucing it up a bit. They have a huge TV screen inside in case someone wants to watch sports or catch-up on Heros.

I&#39;m half Thai half Laos so I think i have a pretty good knowledge of how Thai/Laos homecooking is like.

taco-bell-elgin-3,Wes P.,#NAME?,B-OZgY7HeMlj0sOPi3TDWg,"Everyone,

My own imposed rules for any Chain Restaurant review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Since the food should be the same everywhere, with the exception of regional items, the food category will only be judged on the quality of the expected food (i.e. temperature, consistency, and amount).
3. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Taco Bell - Elgin Southwest

Location/Layout - 5/10:  Easily accessible from McLean Blvd, the restaurant is at the entrance to the shopping area just north of route 20.  Parking is ample and Taco Bell even repaved its parking area unlike the majority of the remaining mall.  Interior is usually clean, with good customer flow now that they removed the sauce island.  Note: The Yelp map has this location incorrectly shown.  It is about two miles north of where it shows on the Yelp page.  

Service - 5/10: Orders are usually taken very efficiently and processed just as quick.  There have been times that the drive through has taken precedence and the eat in patrons are forced to wait.  This is happens a little too frequently and can be annoying if you decide to eat in the store instead of driving off with your food.  

Food - 4.5/10: It is standard Taco Bell fare, which is a good thing.  Their accuracy is usually spot on and they are able to handle special requests relatively well.  There have been a few issues with missing/incorrect items which have always been quickly rectified.  The main issue with this location is that if you order anything that is wrapped, be it a burrito, enchirito, griller, chruchwrap, et al, they always have pockets of stuffing.  One bite will have the entire allotment of cheese and the next will have the full serving of sour cream.  They need to work on spreading the ingredients for the entire length/area of the product.  

Overall Experience - 5.5/10:  Taco Bell, especially the Southwest Elgin location (even before it had a drive through and when it was located across the street in the old fashioned mission design restaurant) has been my fast food staple.  I know they only have around 5 unique ingredients and they just mix and match to create &#34;new&#34; menu options but overall the taste and value for a quick on the go meal is top notch.",27/03/13,279,3,1,4,10,3.1431999999999998,2.364,0.31200000000000006,20.323999999999998,No,2495

Only 2 cars in front of me in the drive and I wasn&#39;t served until 7:28.  A 20+ minute drive thru at 7 pm on Sunday night.  The only good thing was that they didn&#39;t screw up our order.  My wife was devastated that they don&#39;t have Baja sauce anymore!  Probably won&#39;t be back for a while,23/10/16,36,2,1,0,-9,-0.15439999999999993,0.296,0.3,3.404,No,357
taco-bell-elgin-3,SANDRA D.,LWBRM-yxLSWXMY0YyV0aVQ,eK1eyTFUqn3pHg_Dq42-JA,"Taco Bell has, in the past, been a good option for me since they have some tasty meat-free options.  This location is closest to my home so I go there often (at least 1-2 times per week).  Over time, I have seen both the service and quality really go downhill.  

The past 3 weeks in a row, I have gotten home to find that my drive-thru order was made incorrectly.  In each of these situations, the order was correct on the screen &amp; receipt, but the kitchen messed it up.  The first time I got home and called, the manager (Gwen) was friendly and apologetic, indicating that they had new people working that hadn&#39;t been trained sufficiently and she offered to replace my items on my next visit.  (That was great, but would have been nice if they threw in a little something extra for the trouble.)

The second time it happened, it was a male manager (can&#39;t recall his name), he said he would replaced the items on the next visit.  I explained to him that it was happening regularly and that their kitchen staff may need some refresher training.  (This time when I went back, the cashier told me that I shouldn&#39;t have ordered at the drive-thru because he had to call the manager to void the charges -- gee thanks for scolding me, your customer.  Again, nothing extra or an apology from the manager who came up to void the order.)

It just happened again, two days ago, and this time was the worst -- they screwed up two different items and the manager I spoke to when I called was rude.  She did not give me her name when she answered, just said &#34;yes&#34; when I asked if she was the manager.  After explaining AGAIN how this keeps happening and asking if the cause was high turnover (trying to decide if I should even go back there again after 3 out of 3 errors in a row) I asked her name and SHE HUNG UP ON ME!!!  

It is a PITA to get home to find that your order is messed up, and having to scrape undesireable items off or just toss the item, which I had to do this last visit.  When that happens, a good manager will go the extra step to make it right.  When you go back, they should do something extra to make up for the inconvenience - or at least be very nice &amp; say that you&#39;re sorry - which has NEVER happened at this location.  

I used to live in Huntley, which was an excellent Taco Bell.  On the rare occasion they made an error, they would throw in an order of cinnamon twists without even telling you they were doing it, just to go the extra step.  Another time I was asked if I wanted anything else, complimentary.  Now THAT was good management and customer service.  AND their staff was trained properly so the errors were few &amp; far between.

The management at this location is sorely lacking.  They often run out of items (sporks, containers for Mexican pizzas, napkins, etc.) and every time I called, it was a different manager on duty, and almost constant problems with my orders.  The location further north on McLean at Big Timber was even worse last time I went there, so it seems that I am left with no choice but to drive 20 minutes each way to go to South Elgin or even further for Huntley, or stop eating at Taco Bell entirely.",05/09/16,351,1,1,0,-96,-0.48060000000000014,1.756,1.3459999999999999,22.897000000000006,No,3186

I knew she was yanking my chain so I parked and checked my bank account right away and not only did my transaction go through, she charged me an extra $15.56.

An overdue review for one of my oldest bookmarked locales.  I don&#39;t mind driving a ways for great sushi, and a plus that Renita M and I could finally catch up a bit. 

Strip mall location. The restaurant is a little cramped and there&#39;s nothing special about the dÌ©cor. In our section of the restaurant (there are two) it was pretty plain.  But clean. 

We ordered edamame to start but was pleasantly surprised that we each got salad and miso soup as well.  Our order was just some nigiri and maki so perhaps everyone gets the extras.  
I loved the ginger dressing--it was light and creamy and a nice change from many sushi houses where their ginger dressings are often over-powering.  The miso soup was pleasant--nothing too special. 

Our sushi choices were fresh and well-made. White Dragon Roll, California Roll and another I can&#39;t recall.  SWT, Red Snapper and a couple other nigiri pieces.  Our meal was satisfying and at a reasonable price.  

My son got the shrimp and veggie tempura appetizer for his dinner and he enjoyed it as well. 

Nice spot, friendly service.",14/08/16,129,4,2,5,36,5.5347,3.699,0.17,13.130999999999998,No,1098

Kinta had wonderful reviews so we decided to give it a go. It can be found in a strip mall along with a 7-11 and you&#39;re met with friendly workers inside.

Their bento boxes are mighty pricey! $17.50 for chicken but it sure comes with a ton of food! It might just be worth the hefty price tag as we pulled out box after box for the bento box portion of our meal. Their teriyaki chicken was decent though nothing I&#39;m over the moon over and just ever so slightly dry.

For my main meal I had a couple of their basic rolls - Spicy Tuna Roll and the Philly Roll. Their spicy tuna is quite spicy and comes with cucumber (not listed) but I liked it. Same goes for the Philly Roll - a solid option and I liked it just fine. Both were sloppily rolled though, not neatly/tightly done so they were falling apart a bit. 

All in all, Kinta Sushi is a viable option when in the area though I wouldn&#39;t make it a destination spot. Their sushi chef needs to tigheten up the game a bit, as well!",23/06/16,128,3,2,4,14,3.2251,1.661,0.238,11.101,No,1109

The servers and sushi chefs are always smiling and gracious hosts, often bringing miso soup or a house salad with fantastic ginger dressing free of charge. 

I love the wakame salad and sashimi. Several rolls are stand outs: American Dream, Lady Roll, Terminate, and Volcano. Sake don is generous in amount of salmon and rice is usually very good.

Not only psyched but also shocked. My husband and I, if we could, would live on sushi all day every day 365 days a a year. But unfortunately my name isn&#39;t Kim and his name isn&#39;t Kanye ( or maybe rather FORTUNATELY) but either way we don&#39;t have the funds to eat sushi every day!

So we checked out the yelp reviews and pictures and gave it a shot. We ordered pickup. 

My favorite item was the jalapeÌ±o bomb. Those were delicious. I feel like pickup was not the best option for this place because the food was not as good as we had hoped. I think if we had been eating in and consumed the food as it was coming out freshly made then I would have liked it better. 

Some of the rolls were so big I could barely fit them into my mouth in one bite. The items tasted somewhat fresh. Everything was packaged very nicely as well. 

All in all, I would say it was an OK experience. Maybe we will give them one more chance when in town again and we will definitely dine in next time.

We compromise and find places that serve other things. We saw the great ratings for Kinta and thought we would try it out! Maybe it could be our new sushi grounds!

I ordered the Kinta Bento Box. You get a little bit of everything! They start you with miso and salad with ginger dressing. There were 2 spots that had steak and chicken with veggies. Then there was a spot with tempura veggies and shrimp. The last spot had 3 pieces of Nigiri and 6 pieces of Maki. It was way more than I could eat! I took the meat and veggies home for lunch the next day! Everything was fantastic though! The cooked items were perfectly done just to the right temp and the sushi was fresh.

There were a few other couples there, but it was by no means crowded, so we were seated right away.  Our waitress was very sweet, potentially a little too shy.

We split a couple of rolls and a couple bottles of hot sake between us.  As others have mentioned, the rolls are very wide- most slices took two bites for me to be able to handle.  I forget which rolls we ordered, but both were very good and we were pretty well stuffed after splitting the two of them.  The order came with a gratis bowl of miso and salad, which was a nice touch (and something I typically have only seen at the AYCE places, where they would prefer to fill you up sooner than later).

The only major downfall about eating here was that they were obviously ready to close up and head out the moment we got done.  A lady who appeared to be a manager or owner kept walking around to see if we were done and they started breaking down tables, cleaning, and otherwise getting ready to go home shortly after we got our food.

You have to over look the strip mall and pull in, then look past the interior of this place.  It&#39;s small, a little dark and not too shiny...but do try the Taco/Tako Yaki....fried octopus dough with shredded tuna skin on top.  Melt in your mouth, donut hole sized bites of fried dough with octopus in it.  These are a little spicy with a brown sauce drizzled on top.

I&#39;m a pretty picky eater over all and the thought of raw fish just did not do it for me. I was craving miso soup, though, and this place was really highly reviewed on Yelp and I figured I could get chicken teriyaki if I wanted a more substantial meal. 

But when we got there, my more adventurous friend convinced me to get one of the dinner specials that came with California rolls and a couple of pieces of nigiri and to just suck it up and try it. Oh boy was that a mistake. Since that day I have been to Kinta almost every week. I&#39;m completely addicted. Every waiter there knows me and a few even know my regular order. (California sunset, California roll, and the vegetable tempura appetizer) But I&#39;ve seriously gotten almost every roll on offer and all of them are delicious.

My husband has been on a sushi kick for a bit now and while I am learning to like it...even the raw items...it is more his favorite and not mine quite yet.  You may want to keep that in mind while reading this particular review. 

We drove up and I tried to pre-warn him that this sushi hot spot was located in a non-descript strip mall.  Apparently, he wasn&#39;t listening too well as he was not impressed by the outside of the building and the empty parking lot.  With plenty of hesitation we walked inside.  Color me plenty surprised as it&#39;s quite nice and cute inside!  They wanted to seat us in the main dining room off to the right hand side, but I wanted to see the chefs in action and requested a table straight back near the sushi table.  They agreed and we were quickly seated.  There were two chefs ready to work, but we took a while to make our decisions.  There was a lot to consider.  I decided to try some beef gyoza while my husband started with some Chef&#39;s Choice nigiri.  I loved their gyoza!  It was served piping hot with a nice dipping sauce.  There were five pieces and they were a nice size.  Ultimately, this ended up being the vast majority of my dinner because I filled up so quickly.  The nigiri was a hit, too!  The yellowtail was the fan favorite and the whole dish was a success.

We moved on to ordering some additional dishes.  And because my eyes are truly bigger than my stomach, I ordered a spicy scallop roll (cooked) and a shrimp tempura roll (yes, cooked).  My meal came with a little side salad.  The dressing was creamy and very tasty.  He ordered more nigiri and a roll that was raw and served with salmon on top.  He really enjoyed it, but said the nigiri was so good that he could have just stuck with that all evening.  I ate a bite of each of my rolls and brought them home to my son.  I was just too full from the gyoza.  

The restaurant started to fill up a little while we were there and there were quite a few carryout orders.  I think maybe we were a little early at 6ish.  We had excellent service from both woman who were hustling back and forth.  The dishes were cleared promptly and the glasses were kept full.  

The prices were competitive.  My sushi man confirmed he would absolutely stop by for dinner again and I would concur.  Kinta Sushi has made the go-to list for dinner options.",29/10/14,273,4,2,5,50,6.346000000000001,4.367,0.745,27.887999999999998,No,2447

This review is purely on the takeout experience, as the food that I&#39;ve had (both takeout and dine in) has always been great and flavorful. I refrained from writing about my last experience, thinking it was a one-off, but after last night, I don&#39;t think it was.

The last time I got takeout from here, I failed to check all the boxes (or any boxes for that matter!) before I left. We don&#39;t live that far from the restaurant, but far enough that it&#39;s not just down the street. When we got home, we found that the order that I was give was NOT the order I called in. It was completely different! When I called about it, they were apologetic and offered a credit for our next meal.

This time, I called in another phone order and had them repeat the order to make sure that it was right. They quoted 25-30 minutes for the takeout order. I arrived closer to the 30 minute mark since I also had kiddo with me. Those with toddlers know that a wait at a restaurant can go either really good or really bad. Totally depends on how the wind blows! When I arrived, they asked which was my order, and I had a bad feeling when I saw her face. While I waited, I had no less than three other takeout orders come and go before I finally asked where my order was. Kiddo and I were coming up on waiting for 20 minutes. No one really gave me a straight answer as to where my order was, but there was very hurried and frustrated Japanese being thrown around between the workers. Our order finally came, but with no explanation or apology until I asked for the owner. He also had no explanation, which was disappointing. Once I got all the bags and kid into the car, I came to realize that they probably did not start our order until I walked in, as I had 3 rolls of basic sushi (no bells or whistles) and an order for noodles for the kid.

I&#39;ve been here quite a few times, but haven&#39;t had the chance to given a review.  The sushi here is fairly priced and I recommend coming a bit early since the place does get crowded pretty quick in the evening. I have also been here during lunch on a Tuesday and it was packed as well.  

Went out last week with a group and was seated quickly, the restaurant was pretty packed on a Thursday night.  The waitress was kind and seated us quickly. Received the complementary miso soup and salad.  Ordered the Takoyaki, very good and the price is reasonable compared to many other places that I have been too.  For rolls we ordered the Lady Roll, Double Salmon Roll, Chicago Crazy, and the Volcano Roll.

I recommended starting off with the Chicago Crazy roll, some may not be a fan since it has lettuce in it, but its was very refreshing eating this roll then moving on to the heavier rolls.  The cuts of fish were large and fresh.  The salmon and tuna were the melt in your mouth kind! Avocado in the rolls were large and fresh as well.

We also ordered the Bibimbap, which came out in the stone bowl and the rice crisped up nicely.  I would of liked more meat in my bibimbap, but overall it was very good.",10/04/14,144,5,2,5,48,4.7199,2.683,0.577,11.738999999999999,No,1311

It took a while to find a decent place in the suburbs for sushi and this place hits the spot.  For me this place has good prices and good sushi,  Delicious rolls overall, rice was tender, and the fish was fresh. Creative Maki combinations too to note!

We spent $50 for sushi for 2.  They threw in 2 miso soups complimentary.  (I am always appalled when restaurants charge for miso soup.... it&#39;s just broth with tofu for God&#39;s sake!)

chorizo-grill-elgin,Jim S.,MkJWWwDSIVehGBiVU2Ggmw,Ez-nKLskbeX5TE9vgYrukg,"I have literally passed by this place hundreds of times on my way to work, and home.
I was passing by yesterday, and decided to stop by and give this place a try.

It&#39;s larger than I expected... with about 10-12 tables.  I ordered at the counter, but I noticed that they did have table service.

I started with fresh chips and salsa. The chips were hot and fresh out if the fryer. They were good, but perhaps could be better with a bit more salt, and also a little less time in the fryer.
They were complimentary with my food order.  

They had a nice salsa. It was a pretty deep red with some bits of onion and cilantro. It was good, but much spicier than I expected... not necessarily a bad thing. 

They also put 2 squirt bottles on the table.. a red one, and a clear one that contained a creamy green looking sauce.  I generally prefer red, so I tried the red one first.  The sauce was actually green...sort of a tomatillo type with a bit of heat, a bit of sweat, and a tartness. I liked that one. I don&#39;t usually go for avocado based sauces, but I decided to try the green one in the clear bottle.  It was waaaaaaaaaaaaay hot!  I expected a mild type due to the creamy look.  This was interesting, but not really my cup of tea.   

So... on to the main course..  I had a chorizo taco, and a pastor taco.  The chorizo was excellent.  Good flavor, a bit of char, and not greasy.  I asked the waitress if they were making their own chorizo. She said that they were not, and she did not know the brand.  The flavor of this one was very similar to Tacos La Flor. 

On to the Pastor.  It was OK.. The flavor was mostly a predominant BBQ sauce taste. Not bad by any means, but I prefer the style of some of the other places I frequent.


For those that are interested, they also have burgers and some other varied menu items. 

All in all, I may stop by again. I&#39;ll give it a solid 3 stars.  Next time I&#39;ll give the steak a try, and perhaps the chicken as well.",14/05/16,232,3,1,5,-13,6.4109000000000025,4.763999999999999,0.41300000000000003,26.823,No,1975

chorizo-grill-elgin,Bill F.,hphKeHFZYGSe0aK-up4LNw,Ybdlv7gD5E4SQ-j3j73Cjg,"Their Chorizo is clearly homemade (if not here, then somewhere nearby) and has a very interesting blend of spices-- not your typical Chorizo-- it has something in it like cinnamon or cardamom, which gives it an extra layer of flavor normally not present in Chorizo. My son had nachos supreme with chorizo and it was a really nice change from the normal. 

They serve chips and salsa with three different sauces, a homemade red sauce, a creamy Jalapeno sauce and a spicier... I&#39;ll call it &#34;yellow&#34; sauce.  All very good, and a nice change from what you typically get. (don&#39;t be thrown by the squeeze bottles...it isn&#39;t ketchup)

I had a very substantial torta on a fresh roll with marinated pork, and it includes fresh avocado as a standard topping - nice touch. 

The place isn&#39;t fancy, and it&#39;s not exactly on the beaten path, but the food is reasonable and made to order.  A good place for lunch. 

They also have quite a lot of non-mexican stuff like burgers and hot dogs and even Gyros-- much more than a typical mexican place.  Not sure exactly what they&#39;re trying to cater to there, but if you have kids that don&#39;t like mexican, there is probably something they will eat on this menu.

My enchiladas were delicious the mole was absolutely perfect. They came out hot, and the service was great. 

One waitress working the whole dining room during a lunch rush, and she did an amazing job. 

My friends nachos were a regret order.. I wouldn&#39;t recommend any friend of mine to order them.. So I figured I&#39;d tell people on yelp. They&#39;re not gross, but they&#39;re just not nachos worth ordering at a Mexican restaurant. There was a goopy cheese sauce, and over cooked chicken pieces. They were just- kind of okay. 

The atmosphere was clean, nice, and welcoming, but there was no warmth to the place.. It was loud (meaning nothing to absorb sound at all). It also felt as if the heat was not kicked on- My friend and I ate with our coats on.

I would give this hole in the wall (that&#39;s a good thing) 5 stars if they ramp up their service a bit.

chorizo-grill-elgin,Rachel D.,KZue5E8aYSAuu4kmaF4isQ,KJW1oza50TA2Lr7PuVytsA,"Went to Gail Borden my local library in Downtown Elgin and needed to take an alternate route home because there is construction from March to August and my exit McLean Boulevard from Route 20 (Lake Street) is closed all day long, so I turned   from Route 31 onto Highland. While driving down Highland I spotted this restaurant on the corner of Highland and Washington Street which I never would have known about, had there been no construction &amp; closed exit on Route 20. 

I decided to take a chance and stop as it was well past lunchtime and I could feel my Hypoglycemia start to kick in. Having recently gone back to eating Gluten &amp; Dairy Free, 99% of the time I can usually find something I can eat at a Mexican Restaurant. 

I decided to order the Taco Platter which came with 3 tacos with my choice of fillings. I choose one with chicken, one with steak, and one with chorizo (Mexican sausage) on corn tortillas which comes topped with fresh cilantro and onions if you want, which I did, I also asked for tomato, lettuce and avocado to be added in. The platter comes with rice &amp; refried beans all for $7.95. I did not realize it was going to still be 25 cents extra for an avocado slice on each of my tacos as I did not get cheese or sour cream as I am avoiding dairy.  Originally I ordered Guacamole but when I found out it would be $4.50 I took a pass as it would be more then I wanted for one meal.

I placed my order as a carry-out because the doors were open to the restaurant and there were bees flying in and out, being allergic to bees, wasps, hornets, etc. I do not want to take the chance of getting stung and needing to use my Epi-pen just to eat something,  the service was very fast.

Once I arrived home to eat my food I was delighted with the flavor/seasoning/taste of all my taco fillings, the corn tortillas were very good despite being on the soggy side. Perhaps if I had eaten at the restaurant this might not have happened? The  rice was good but not great due to an excess of salt for my  taste buds. The refried beans were topped with cheese which disappointed me as I said no cheese. I picked out the cheese and the rest of the beans were very good.

The girl at the counter told me on Fridays from 10AM-7PM and Sat-Sun 8AM-4PM they have weekend specials of Gorditas, Quesadillas, Sopes, Huaraches, Menudo, &amp; Taco Rojos all hand made with Natural Corn Flour. I am excited about going back and trying Pumpkin Flower, Corn Truffle or Mushroom Quesedilla&#39;s.

They also have traditional American fair on the menu:  Burgers, Italian Beef, Polish Sausage, Chili, Corn Dog, Pizza Puff, Cheese Sticks, Onion Rings, Buffalo Wings, Fries, Nachos, Shrimp Cocktail, Hot Dog, Chili Dog, Gyros, Chicken &amp; Fish Sandwich. 

There are some American items with Mexican twists the Guacamole Burger, Chori-Burger, A La Diabla Shrimp, Taco Salad, Los Dorados, Chori Dog and assorted beverages.",28/03/12,348,3,1,2,-12,1.7857,1.238,0.784,16.979,No,2924

The food was decent but service was definitely lacking.  I wasn&#39;t expecting 5 star service since it is a diner but what we received was pretty terrible.

My friend and I came around 8pm on a Friday and it was pretty dead except for a couple tables.  I had the Fritta skillet with a side of potato pancakes and my friend had the sausage and cheese omelette with a side of bacon pancakes.  Both the omelettes and skillets come with a side of buttermilk pancakes, toast, or potato pancakes.  Here are some of the pros and cons from dinner.

CONS: 
1) I ordered the potato pancakes with my skillet..the waiter came out with buttermilk pancakes
2) The waiter asked us if we wanted more water rather than just refilling our glasses
3) We had to wait a long time before our waiter came to check on us and get us our checks because he was busy cleaning the counters
4) When we asked for separate checks, he looked confused and said &#34;oh..separate checks&#34; and acted like most people don&#39;t ask for it

PROS:
1) Food came out fast
2) Food was pretty good and portion sizes were fairly large for the price

I loved the interior. Many who are my age and younger might say that it is dated, but it reminds me of the kind of restaurants my parents took me to as a kid back in the 1970s. It had that Chicago nostalgia feeling to it, so I was alright with it. Still, the booths were a little small. The service was nice and friendly as well. Those were the good point.

However, looks and service can take you so far. The food didn&#39;t live up to the hype. I ordered the traditional Eggs Benedict and the eggs were not prepared correctly. One had only a slightly runny yoke while the other was basically cooked solid. My mother went there a few weeks earlier and had the same experience. As far as the taste, it was great. However, with Eggs Benedict, those eggs have to be spot on, but they were terribly off. If they were spot on, I could give this place a 5-star review.",05/01/15,103,3,2,3,30,2.0652999999999997,3.0039999999999996,0.774,12.222,No,940

But that&#39;s where our experience took an unfortunate turn for the worse.

We were seated in a section with a rude, old waitress who definitely shouldn&#39;t be working in the hospitality industry. Her attitude and demeanor would have been more fitting of a truck stop diner than a family restaurant. I&#39;ve probably never had such a bad waitress in my life.

I ordered the Special Club #3 which comes with chilled juice. Now, I&#39;ve been to many breakfast places and I always order orange juice. It&#39;s a staple part of my breakfast. But I&#39;ve never seen such a small serving. It might as well have been poured into a shot glass. But considering it&#39;s part of a combo I&#39;ll play along.

Maxfields seems like a standard family owned pancake house.  Nothing really stands out about it.  The decor is unassuming, a nice selection of booths and tables to accommodate a variety of parties.  Our wait was about 15 mins, which was much appreciated, especially given our pint-sized diners.

Our waitress was friendly enough and made sure that we were offered drinks right away.  She wasn&#39;t super pushy when it came to us lolly gagging about what we wanted to order.  Our food came quickly, despite the restaurant being packed at the time, which was pretty impressive.

From a quick glance, the menu is pretty extensive, although I had a mad hankering for crepes, so I didn&#39;t take much notice of anything else on the menu.  My dining companions got crepes and pancakes.  The food was alright, fairly standard breakfast fare.  The portions were pretty generous, and I felt like I got a lot for my money, which is always nice.

I will have to say that the servers weren&#39;t turned off by our kids, which is worth noting and much appreciated, despite the fact that the toddler of the group proceeded to sticker the table (don&#39;t worry, we cleaned it up before we left).  

I don&#39;t think that Maxfield&#39;s would be our first choice of breakfast places for out next get together, but if our go-to place is beyond packed (again), it&#39;s nice to know that Maxfield&#39;s will be our solid plan B.",03/11/13,181,3,2,5,25,5.2374,2.558,0.267,11.176,No,1590

My dad ordered one of the specials and got an entree along with bread, soup, and dessert - a great value.

After a couple more visits, the service is still excellent, the food is still prepared a bit lighter in sugar/salt than other restaurants, the prices are still good, and the portion sizes are still large. Here&#39;s some things that stood out:

The soups here great. After visiting many other family restaurants in the area, I find that this is probably my favorite place to go for soups, especially when they have creamy soups.

The beer battered scrod and shrimp creole here are delicious as well and provide a great reason to come here on Fridays. However, I did not like the texture or flavor of the macaroni and cheese at all.

Regarding texture again, the broiled perch, meatloaf, roast sirloin of beef, and pot roast could&#39;ve all used better texture although the flavors were pretty good. Maybe the meat is simply too lean to get an excellent texture without being higher in fat.

The restaurant is great in potatoes, whether it&#39;s potato pancakes, fried, or mashed they&#39;re all good.

The ice cream is good here too and for some people, if you add whipped cream on top you will be very pleased. The rice pudding is still in my opinion the best in the area. Extra cinnamon and cream make this a real delight.

Still not a big fan of the cakes/pies but the cheesecake is quite nice.

The waitress offered to bring her something else. Someone else had ordered a Denver omelette and said it was good, so she ordered that. 

By the time she got it, the rest of us were almost done eating. Then, when we got the bill, we saw that they tried to charge her for the original entree as well. When she brought that to the attention of the manager, she took off the entree but still charged for the soup. She said that because my mom ate the soup, she had to be charged.

Unfortunately I have not been impressed with the quality of the food at all.  I had a craving for a corned beef sandwich and decided to try Maxfield&#39;s out for dinner.

The bread they brought to the table was stale, clearly left out all day. The sandwiches we ordered came with soup, and the bowl of chicken soup we each received was a bit salty but otherwise good. 

The corned beef sandwich on rye was very disappointing. I can forgive the small amount of meat used, after all, I have been used to some places piling on 3 inches of meat and I never finish a sandwich that size in one sitting, so only an inch or so of meat is reasonable. But the bread was very thinly sliced and not toasted, so it quickly fell apart while eating the sandwich, which had no toppings like mustard or mayo, and I was not offered any of these.  The meat was also not terribly fresh, and had likely just been microwaved before being slapped on some plain bread.

My wife&#39;s gyros was packaged gyros meat, not shaved from a spit as I expected from a Greek restaurant. She only had a few bites before pushing it to the side.

I will say that the french fries we both received in abundance were really great. They had a nice battered texture, stayed hot, and were very tasty.

We ordered an egg, sausage, and pancakes for my son. The scrambled egg was literally tasteless, and the hash browns were soggy and tasted awful. The sausage was a little soft but otherwise fine, and the pancakes oddly tasted a bit like yellow cake rather than pancake, but were generally good.

I did not come to Maxfield&#39;s with high expectations at all, but I was still disappointed. With all the good reviews here I was expecting better.

The menu is extensive if you figure in the lunch menu, but we were here early so it was breakfast only.

I decide to order some Cinnamon Apple Crepes since it sounded delish. Our server was very good as she kept our coffee cups filled and checked in on us frequently. The food came out pretty quick, which was good since I was famished. The Pork Chops were served still in the marinade, and they were so tender and tasty.

It&#39;s a neighborhood breakfast spot located at the end of a strip mall with lots of seating, great food with quality ingredients, and local diners.  The breakfast prices are reasonable -- a real value for what you get, too.  The place is clean, comfortable, and presentable -- nothing fancy, but right at home.  The waitresses and manager (an older woman who rules the roost with a keen eye for order and customer comfort) are welcoming and on top of their game.

For breakfast, I ordered an omlette with sweet, crisp apples and cheddar cheese -- my first omlette with fruit in it, and a surprisingly wonderful combination.  My son got his usual eggs and bacon, which kept him happy.  My husband ordered a Mexican style omlette -- very spicy.  All generously portioned and delicious.

Menu options are plentiful as well but standard except for their &#34;baked pancakes&#34; and Greek versions of popular breakfast items.

I opted for the cornedbeef hash omelette with a side of potato pancakes and my wife chose a rather plain french toast with sausage and bacon. Both were acceptably well prepared in a standard diner fashion and neither of us had complaints about portions.

Service was attentive and my coffee was topped off, literally, after every 2 sips. Almost annoying but I&#39;d rather have piping hot coffee than lukewarm coffee so I really shouldn&#39;t complain.

Our final bill rounded off to just under $20 not including tip and we left full and satisfied.

maxfields-pancake-house-and-restaurant-schaumburg,Cristie F.,d-KWUwwt9jGmuIBG5pyP0w,QuHEUoiVSPS2td5UyvhwKA,"I was pretty damn impressed with Maxfields. In a last minute decision, and as last ditch effort to find a decent breakfast joint on a Saturday morning at 11:30am, I remembered Maxfields hidden in the strip mall at Schaumburg//Plum Grove Road. I had eaten there years back and remembered it being somewhat decent - but definitely worth giving it another try. 

I was really surprised to find there wasn&#39;t a wait. I was also really thrilled. I was starving, and anything more than a 5 minute wait was going to crank up my crankiness. I am diabetic after all, and I can turn into a raging B when my sugar is low. ((Sounds fun, huh??))

The menu was huge, offering your standard diner fare for both breakfast and lunch. I was somewhat sad to see it wasn&#39;t very vegetarian friendly. Aside from salads, pancakes, eggs, etc., the only other offering I spotted in terms of a lunch type meal was an olive burger. And that didn&#39;t really appeal at 11:30am. ((Oh well - I&#39;m not completely veg anyway)) Portions were huge, and the prices were low, which also pleased me immensely.

I settled on having a half order of biscuits and gravy, a fruit bowl, and 2 scrambled egg whites. My bf ordered the bacon waffle and a side order of potato pancakes. Everything was delicious. The potato pancakes were a little heavy for my liking, but they had good flavor. The waffle had bacon chunks baked in, with a few pieces of bacon laying on top to much on. YUM. Biscuits and gravy could have used a little more flavor, but they weren&#39;t too terrible. I just prefer more of a kick!

The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive. She made sure we had everything we needed. Once we ordered, our food was out in a matter of minutes - and still hot and fresh!

The coffee, on the other hand, was kind of gross and tasted faintly of alcohol.  According to a quick Google search that may mean that the coffee beans were a little past their prime.  In addition, the service can be spotty and the wait can be long.

Another plate we ordered was a feta omelette, which was eggcellent! The eggs with tomatoes, spinach and cheese hit the spot. The side dish of potato pancakes was a real gag to swallow.

I was a big fan of Mike &amp; Miguel&#39;s in Geneva and was sad when they closed.  Since then, I have been trying various Mexican restaurants and hoping to make one my go-to place for Mexican.

I did a take-out order.  The ambiance and setup fit my style.  I&#39;m not a fancy person and like things to be simple.  Walk up to a counter, place your order, pay, get a receipt with a number on it, and go wait at a table.  After a few minutes they have your order at a window and you get your food.  The staff was polite and friendly.

I got a chicken macho burrito, which I believe is their largest size.  It was definitely big and a lot of food for the $7.95 price.  I didn&#39;t finish it for two reasons.  First, I was feeling full after eating 3/4 of it.  Second, it only tasted OK.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t good either.

This was really good. We both got chimichangas which we awesome (steak was cut in tiny pieces which was actually nice). Flavors were great. Spicy but not overwhelming. Pretty good. We also got queso fundido.

So here&#39;s why its not 5 stars:

The queso fundido wasn&#39;t what I&#39;m used to. I&#39;m used to cheese with chorizo on top all melted and sizzling when it arrives, served with chips or corn tortillas. The version here was cheese and chorizo and some kind of salsa/sauce mixed which made it a lot like soup. It was still ok tasting, but threw me off.

Second, the chimichangas had sauce/salsa on them, cool no problem it tasted fantastic. But that sauce (same as in the fundido, mind you) was liquidy. And my plate had a layer of liquid on it. Fine for enchiladas or something. But you just fried this burrito to perfection, all crunchy and delicious, and now there&#39;s liquid under it making it all soggy. 

My favorite part of chimichangas is the crunch. So, you lost me there too.

The salsas they gave us were meh, but the food didn&#39;t need it! Pretty good.",30/12/15,142,4,2,5,35,5.758,5.359,0.7929999999999999,15.848,No,1249

Guess what? It&#39;s still pretty good! The building itself is charming, &#34;loud&#34; and easy to find. I still hate what they call a parking lot but that&#39;s not really worth deducting any stars for. 

I&#39;ve never tried the more &#34;American&#34; Styled food. But I&#39;m sure if I did, I wouldn&#39;t like this place as much. No one raves about their hot dogs that&#39;s for sure! (I&#39;ve never verified this)

I&#39;ve had tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and tamales, I would say I&#39;ve liked them all. Again being in the suburbs of Chicago, there are a lot of great Mexican/Latin food. This is one of those places.

I love it here!

The place is clean, the service is timely and you can tell that everything is fresh. The steak tacos are authentic and delicious, they do add cheese and lettuce to the tacos which isn&#39;t EXACTLY authentic, but I like them this way! The rice and beans are flavorful and you can tell they are homemade. The Salsas, guacamole and chips are homemade as well! The chips come out piping hot so you can tell they make them to order, or at least close to it. The queso fundido was something that stood out to me. Queso fundido is melted cheese on top of chorizo, you can eat it with chips or wrap it in a tortilla, for those who do not know.  It is hard to find this dish somewhere that reminds me of how my father made it, and the jalapeno grill did it! ( My dad is an excellent cook so this review means that much more haha).

Couple of things that stand out to me.  I LOVE the fish taco&#39;s here!  Arguably the best I have had in the area.  Nice size, topped with a tasty cabbage slaw.  Well worth trying.  Steak tacos are very good, as are the barbacoa tacos.  I have recently found the Tacho&#39;s Burrito, which is the perfect burrito for me (add cilantro and onion to anything and I&#39;m hooked), and had breakfast for the first time the other day.  Again, Tacho&#39;s Omelet.  Loved it!  Will definitely be back for that!

Finally stopped.   Interior is every bit as cute as exterior.   Woman inside was a bit reserved at first, but gave us a genuine thank you as we left.  Her service was fast and accurate.  

Surprisingly extensive menu for a little tiny restaurant.  In addition to standard mexican fair, they have enough american food (hamburgers, fries, grilled cheese) to allow a family with a fussy eater (mine!) to eat there.

I had flautas combo (rice, beans, fixins).  Tasty.  Not being an expert on mexican food, and never having had flautas before, I can only say they were too crunchy for my liking - so I probably would not order again - but I suspect this is a personal taste thing, and not a problem with the food - all ingredients were fresh and tasty.

Tasted hubby&#39;s burrito - an impressive beast.  It was good-good-good. As usual, hubby ordered the better item on the menu.  (Darnit!  How does he always do that?)

Definately will return next time we are doing a St. Charles/Geneva run.

Prices were reasonable - my combo was in the $7 range.

the-jalapeno-grille-st-charles,Amanda B.,vNwEPW2S4cvlubjWCB6rIw,HjNBdr7YTrezmDIziIEbMw,I love this place and have enjoyed everything I have eaten there.  My favorite is the carne asada tacos.  The prices are so affordable too.  I started going there about two years ago and it is my favorite mexican restaurant in the area.  The only draw back is the fact that they don&#39;t have air conditioning in the summer so make sure you eat fast.,17/09/12,35,4,1,3,5,2.1126,1.084,0.0,3.916,No,351
the-jalapeno-grille-st-charles,Scott K.,zvXi85MvIVHQiJvsZmcZWA,0y22vtR0Kbg2jzWryIcajA,"I&#39;ve been wanting to try The JalapeÌ±o Grille for quite sometime, (a real long time, couple of years if not more) but each time I saw it wasn&#39;t  eating time or I just wasn&#39;t in the mood for Mexican if it was eating time. Well, this past Sunday my wife Michelle I finally tried it. It isn&#39;t visible from Saint Charles main downtown but rat

The first thing I was surprised is the menu was much more then just Mexican it had some hot dogs, Italian &amp; Polish sausage, beef sandwiches, burgers and more  one would not expect to find on a menu of a place called JalapeÌ±o Grille. As I scoured the menu I saw many appealing items the most being T J Spicy burger, but I pretty much had my mind set-on a taco.  So went for it and Michelle decided on the same.

It is a order at the counter type place and I have to say our order taker wasn&#39;t full of sparkle and seemed like she was not enjoying the moment but we all have them moments so I decided not to let that to influence the most important part of eating the food itself.

I decided on three ground beef tacos, one in the hard shell, a corn shell and soft shell. I of course not being the veggie king of any cuisine requested meat and cheese only. I know boring but veggies and I just cannot get along once they and my taste buds make contact. However, I was told there were onions in the ground beef, but figured OK let&#39;s impress the wife and go for it. 

Yeah the fact that their was going to be onion in the ground beef had me thinking my taco would appear with these big honking onions, but I was glad to see that was not the case, though there were small bits of potato in there also it did not bum me like it did at another Mexican place. They were smaller and not as plentiful and no carrots, the tacos on their own wee not spicy but I added some red sauce and was soon enjoying all three wishing I had more.

We ate in and the seating was scare but OK, the dÌ©cor was basic Mexican bright colors making it more welcoming and I enjoyed some of the posters promoting Mexican films. The parking was even scarcer and we had to end up parking at a nearby park but the walk was short and exercise was good for me.

I very much want to return and try more items (and won&#39;t wait nearly as long, next week maybe). However since I only tried the ground beef tacos (didn&#39;t try nachos and from another review wishing I would have) can only give it three stars but I&#39;m feeling positive those future visits will eventually make me a fan, however I&#39;d welcome you to beating me in becoming a fan of The JalapeÌ±o Grille.

Not only is their food authentic Mexican, but their prices are incredibly affordable given the high quality of food in big portions.  It&#39;s tough to start naming favorite things because they really nail it in every category:  apps, entrees, dessert, drinks.  Their blackboard with chalk is fun to look at and has more warmth for us than a typical menu board.  They serve some other foods too that don&#39;t strike us as particularly Mexican, but we guess that those things (burgers, fries, etcetera)  are to appeal to a wider spectrum of people.  Their tacos rock, their flan is second to none, they have horchata - yes - but they also introduced me to a new drink pronounced  like, &#34;huh mai cuh&#34;.  Their rice and refried beans are really nice too.  Their salsa is also outstanding.

alianos-ristorante-batavia,Lane L.,OxF-Od4xq5d4cxJaMkym1A,BU1bqCEm9u2pDEg9wrrFvQ,"After a Christmas concert my kids partook in at church this past Saturday night, my Wife made reservations here.  Not completely sure why (she did look at their menu online and deduced that because they had red meat, chicken, etc, I&#39;d be ok), but with me being VERY finicky and basically a &#34;plain&#34; type person (I don&#39;t like a lot of &#34;crap&#34; like sauces, seasonings, garnishment, or other &#34;contamination&#34; such as vegetables), going to fancier places just isn&#39;t something we do.  So again, why she picked this place, I dunno.

Anyway, enjoyed messing around with Mother Catherine (I think that was her name), when we first arrived.  We got seated right away.  Our waitress was great, albeit service was a little slow (not her fault in any way/shape/form).

Again, I reiterate, I am not into fancy things and am VERY picky when it comes to eating, much less liking specific ethnic foods, so Italian surely isn&#39;t one of them that is tops on my list.  So after reading the menu, my choice was steak or pizza.  It ended up being pizza for all (My mother who was with us is much like me too).  I didn&#39;t go with steak because I wish restaurants would understand... A MAN wants a steak!  Not a paltry 12 ounce bite of red meat.  A 12oz steak to me is a snack.  Not even an appetizer!  So I certainly wasn&#39;t going to pay $30+ for a snack.  If it were a big, two pound, three pound, or more slab or red meat beauty, I&#39;ll pay for it, not 12 ounces!  Gimme a steak that it&#39;s thickness is measured in inches and hangs over the plate it&#39;s on, and a baked potato the size of a football and I&#39;m happy as a clam!  But back on point...

Anyway, the pizza WAS excellent, but I feel like a melon-farmer ordering a pizza in a more &#34;upscale&#34; joint.  Obviously other patrons there were on dates, a family get together, or more intimate affairs, and eating more high end &#34;crap&#34; (as I will call it), so me ordering a &#34;pie&#34; looks a little odd.",09/12/15,243,4,1,5,-22,4.0324,1.918,0.362,15.721000000000002,No,2003

We when you go to a restaurant you are looking for two things, good food and good service.  We had heard good things about  Aliano&#39;s so we expected both.  Unfortunately we were disappointed because of the service.
Our server, although nice enough, preferred to talk more than serving her customers.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, exchanging brief conversations is a friendly way to interact and create a pleasant experience.  But I really do not need to know what she did the previous day and who she did it with.  Not to the level of detail she provided us, especially when it adversely affects  the people she is responsible for serving.
For example, we ordered an appetizer and enjoyed some bread while waiting.  Our server stopped by the table to let us know the appetizer would be out in just a couple minutes and then proceeded to carry on a lengthy conversation with the table next to ours.  I would say it lasted a good ten minutes (she all but pulled up a chair) before the diners at the table asked if they could order.  All the while we are sitting, waiting for our appetizer which I am sure was sitting in the kitchen service window the whole time.  It tasted like it could have been great had it not been so cold.
The rest of the dinner was served better, although after waiting again, we had to ask for our salads and I would have liked to have had some time to finish them before ours dinners arrived.
Also, I ordered a Manhattan to enjoy before my meal.  It was poorly made as all I could taste was cherry juice.  I thought about sending it back, but decided I would make the best of it.   Turns out that when the bill came, I had spent $11.00 for it.  I don&#39;t pay that much for a drink like that  in downtown Chicago, let alone in a small, suburban restaurant.  I wish I had sent it back now.
So the bottom line is the food was and/or would have been very good. The service was exceptionally poor given the time of day(remember this was early, about 5 o&#39;clock before any rush).  And the drinks were expensive and not of the best quality.
I always like to give a restaurant a second chance especially if there were some good qualities seen.  So we will be going back at least one more time, but we won&#39;t be going out of our way to do so anytime soon.",26/12/15,251,2,2,5,47,5.904,3.9400000000000004,1.216,19.843,No,2439

There was only one person working, with about 10 tables to take care of.  He also had to answer phones and seat people.  It&#39;s completely possible he was the one cooking the food in the back too, based on the lack of service.  

We sat down and waited 10 minutes for our drinks (water and soda, nothing that required time). He then explained to us that they were out of about 6 things on the menu.  We understood; Mother&#39;s Day was the day prior and I&#39;m sure they were busy. We ordered appetizers and asked if it would be best if we took our entrees to go, since we only had an hour for lunch.  He assured us our pasta would be ready in &#34;15 minutes tops&#34;. Well, 25 minutes later we got our appetizers and he said our pastas would be right up.  20 minutes later, we asked him to box our entrees up because we had already been there over an hour.  He didn&#39;t even offer an apology for the delay.

When we got back to the office, we had our food.  It tasted ok, but the lunch portions were hilariously small for the price.  The ravioli lunch entree includes THREE raviolis - not the large sized ravioli, but the small size.  Literally 3 bites of food for $10.

For appetizers, we had the goat cheese bruschetta and fried ravioli.  Both were very good and portion size was exactly what you&#39;d expect - 4-5 pieces of bruschetta and 10-12 ravioli.

We were blown away by the quality of  the good and the attentive service.  They made suggestions that we spot on. We had a great evening and have suggested the restaurant to all of our friends. 
We just held our son high school graduation party at Aliano&#39;s last sunday and had a group of 18 with 14 of them being their first time. The food we choose with the help of Mario the owner and &#34;Momma Catherine&#34; was awesome. Everyone was in awe of the food and wanted to come back soon. My parents told me they wished they had a Aliano&#39;s by their house. Scott our server was awesome. 
The appetizer was a fresh made bruchetta,  the main course was stuffed shells and chicken parmesan,  which both were top notch (there was a bit of a discussion on who was going to take the extra pices home) and for dessert... homemade canollis and tiramisu.  Needless to say no one was hungry when we left.
The drinks were great and they have a great selection of beers including Bell&#39;s amber and oberon. Everyone was friendly and welcoming to our group and even momma came by to say hello to me and give our son an embarrassing kiss and congratulations on graduating. Classic!
Mario- your awesome keep up the great work!",21/05/15,132,5,2,5,20,5.815800000000001,2.86,0.262,11.878,No,1278

I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with our experience altogether. Service was quick, friendly and smooth. Our server did forget to bring one thing, but she was busy and I asked another server. Otherwise, service was great. 

The food was not too shabby either. We had fresh hot bread and oil to dip in, baked mostacioli and gnocchi. The red sauce was excellent and the gnocchi was light and fluffy.

The second time we came for the lunch buffet. Unfortunately, all the entrees were cold because the heating/serving dishes were not properly lit. Our waiter offered to heat up our plates for us. In the meantime, they re-lit the serving dishes. By the time we finished our re-heated plates, the buffet still had not yet warmed up.

Our waiter went to check out the possibility of this, and the owner or manager came out...profusely apologizing...and gave us our lunch for free. Kudos to him...mistakes happen and he owned up to it.

Strike one: while refreshing one of the foods they put the cover on the floor and then put it back over the fresh food. Unsanitary much?

I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re confused about what new York style is but what they serve is NOT that. New York style is thin and cut in big triangles. Normally,  you can fold it and eat it like a sandwich.  Alianos NY style was almost like double dough with a crust on Crack!   It was so thick and heavy. When they handed us the box I knew something was wrong just by the weight alone!

alianos-ristorante-batavia,Seeker O.,WBorSqafQPGK5qFM3bIaJw,bVnCBcGNFvSyr801WhHhYw,"I decided to give this place a try after reading a few reviews. So what was the final outcome?....Meh. It&#39;s not the worst Italian restaurant I&#39;ve ever been but certainly not the best either. I&#39;d probably rate Rosebuds or Zsa Zsa&#39;s ahead of this establishment. 

Since it my first time, the decision was made to order the basics. Here&#39;s my thoughts:

Calamari Fritti - lightly fried with a marina sauce. Kind of chewy which is fine although I&#39;ve been to place where it melts it in your mouth. I guess it&#39;s what you prefer. Rating-okay... A little too chewy

Papa Gnochi - potato stuffed pasta. Not as flavorful as I had hoped. It does come with a marina sauce but very salty. Normally I don&#39;t have an issue but this time it really stuck out. Rating-chewy and okay but tone down the salt in the sauce.

Broccoli cream soup - flavorful and very creamy but again, very salty. (What&#39;s up with that?) Rating - good but less salt.

Thin crust pizza -  this was disappointing. Not only did I get the wrong pizza but there was huge order in front of so they couldn&#39;t correct their mistake. I did try what was presented and found it to be dry and really not that great. Rating - not great with a cardboard like texture

Overall this was an average place. I may come back another day and try again but for now I think I&#39;ll try a few other places instead. One positive note was that the  cost of the pizza was deducted from the final bill so you have to give them credit for that.",18/08/13,162,3,1,1,4,0.43589999999999995,1.7100000000000002,1.278,19.011000000000003,No,1512

alianos-ristorante-batavia,Vanessa S.,#NAME?,sU1PPCDChbJs0uv86JZWcQ,"I&#39;m not ready to give up Aliano&#39;s. We went for dinner later on a Saturday night, there was a private party in the bar which in my opinion is a terrible idea - have parties in a private room, not taking over the entire bar.  However, the hostess seated us right away in a dining room, and the ambience was great - except the two owners kept adjusting the lights, one would make it a little brighter, and the other would turn them down so dimly I had to whip out me cell phone for some light. Has anyone else noticed the menu is printed in about size 7 font?? I can barely read that thing, and I&#39;m young!  

The service was fair, the waiter was very friendly but just seemed inexperienced. He would disappear for long periods of time, his timing just seemed off. We got drinks and soup with minor delays, but then he cleared the soup and bolted - hello? Can we please place our dinner order? He refilled my water but ignored the other glass because he seemed nervous to reach for it, never asked if he wanted another glass of wine, and we had to find him to ask for the check because he was so immersed in cleaning for the end of the shift. It seems like Aliano&#39;s has an abundance of servers because you can see groups of them standing around, but they all seemed trained in avoiding eye contact. 

If it wasn&#39;t for the food, I probably would not return to Aliano&#39;s. We had two types of their New York Style pizza, we could taste the fresh ingredients, and it was honestly the best pizza I&#39;ve had in a while. Looking around, the entrees looked equally appetizing, especially the seafood, I can&#39;t wait to try more of the menu!

Overall, Aliano&#39;s has potential. The bar, when not packed by a party is a great place to enjoy a drink, the food is fresh and delicious, and the space is fun and cozy.

Our experience was ok. Some entres excellent. Some so so. Overall, my opinion is that this restaurant is a little overpriced based on what we received. Service was not an issue.

We started out with an anti Pasto appetizer. I had high expectations given we were at an Italian restaurant. The dish was ok, with some nice meats. Not quite what I expected, however. The bread was good, as was the olive oil. Salads were average. I expected freshly grated cheese for the salads, and the entrees, but this was not offered.

We had a couple of pasta specials and a couple of pizzas. The pasta dishes were solid. One of the pizzas was very good, Luigis I believe. The other pizza was a white pizza that suffered from a severe lack of flavor. Had a little garlic, but nothing else.

Prices are about $13 to $15 for an 18&#34; pizza. Pasta dishes were in the range of $12 to $18, with a side salad running $5 more.

alianos-ristorante-batavia,Nancy M.,QcN4g85Iu5rvHvMbm80ung,GsOl9axNCNE03NKI8i_sUA,"We purchased the Sunday dinner buffet through Amazon.  When our group went up the first time (close to the time that the buffet was set out), everything tasted really good and the buffet table was fully stocked.  We wanted to try some other options and we all went up again.  To our surprise there was virtually nothing in the pans and it didn&#39;t look as though anything was going to be replenished.  We had to tell our waitress that they needed to refill the pans (of everything, including entrees, salad and dessert) and to add clean plates, all that was left on the buffet table were dirty plates.  After waiting about 10-20 minutes for more food, we were disappointed with this food.  It was strange to us that the everything was so good the first time, but remarkably different at our second helping.  Granted, it didn&#39;t make or break our meal, but I thought that the buffet could have been set up differently.  Right next to the dinner plates was a small dish of salad and dessert (fried dough with chocolate).  I thought it was odd that the dessert wasn&#39;t at the end of buffet.  

When it came to pay, I thought that the entire meal (excluding tax) would be covered by what we purchased by Amazon since it said it we were paying for one dinner buffet, including soft drink.  However, that wasn&#39;t the case.  We each had to pay .95 -- again, not that it was a big deal and that we couldn&#39;t afford the .95, but that&#39;s not how it was represented to us when we purchased the voucher.  When we asked our waitress about that, she said the price of the buffet was a higher price than the voucher and then she said it was the tax amount, but there was another entry on our bill for tax that we paid...very confusing.  I think she just didn&#39;t know what to say.

We purchased one more buffet on Amazon, but that will be the last time we go to this restaurant.

alianos-ristorante-batavia,Dorothy P.,#NAME?,riir8DMjjpHhOWm-Tt_8kg,"Fan-tastic.  I will have to start out by saying that I bought a Groupon deal for Aliano&#39;s a few months ago because the restaurant is in the same strip mall as the dance studio (The Attic) that I have Zumba classes.  The expiration date was fast approaching, so my husband and I decided it was time to bite the bullet and give them a go.  

We dined on a Wednesday night and were pleasantly surprised to see that they were quite busy.  I would note that we sort of had a rough start.  We walked into the restaurant, and there was no one there to seat us.  A few of the servers walked by and offered a quick &#34;hi,&#34; but that was about it.  After waiting about 5 minutes for someone to seat us, I joked that we might not be able to review them on Yelp, since no one wanted to seat us (but they sure are good at saying hello).  Luckily for everyone, one of the servers was nice enough to escort us to an open table after she dropped off drinks at a table she was waiting on.

We were promptly greeted by our friendly waitress, who took our drink order and suggested the spicy calamari special to start with (before we really had much chance to check out the menu).  She could see that we were a little dazed still, so she went to grab our drinks instead.  By the time she came back, we had decided that calamari sounded delightful and ordered the appetizer special (before we realized that the entrees come with a soup or salad...hello leftovers).  I ordered the tortellini alla prosciutto, while my dining companion (also known as the husband) opted for a baked mostaccioli with a meatball.  We both ordered the Italian soup since it was pretty darn cold outside that night.

When the appetizer arrived, I knew we were in trouble in the best possible way.  The server put down between us a heaping plate of lightly fried calamari &amp; we looked at each other.  Wow, the calamari was perfectly cooked, not rubbery at all.  The breading was nice and light with minimal greasiness, and the hot peppers that it was all tossed in gave just the right amount of kick.  The soup was good too, although not super memorable (had I written this review quickly, I could probably be more descriptive.  You&#39;ll just have to try it for yourself). By my last spoonful of soup, I was stuffed.  I guess that&#39;s what you call a rookie mistake.  In the spirit of perseverance, however, I decided not to throw in the towel.  Oh no, I&#39;m not a quitter.

Our entrees came out perfectly timed, piping hot, and heaping in our respective bowls.  My husband&#39;s meatball was about the size of a baseball (oh my goodness), which was pretty darn impressive.  The alfredo sauce on my tortellini was delicious, nice and light, sort of brothy but creamy at the same time.  I took a few savory bites before I decided that I probably shouldn&#39;t stuff myself.

Then things took a turn...my husband looked at me and said &#34;how about dessert&#34; even though our dinner plates had hardly been touched.  Like the fool that I am, I happily agreed that dessert was a good idea, thinking we&#39;d probably share something, I&#39;d take a few bites &amp; leave him to finish it up.  Bzzz, wrong.  We can never agree on a dessert, so we each ordered our own.  Judging from the picture on the dessert menu, I picked the pistachio gelato with chocolate sauce.  It looked dainty, like it was served in a cute little shot glass, just enough ice cream to satiate any nook of empty stomach I might have left.  Wrong, this thing, like the rest of the food portions that we had enjoyed thus far, was HUGE.  My hungrier half opted for the cheesecake brownie, essentially cheesecake filling stuffed between two brownies &amp; covered in chocolate.  This thing looked like a cake in and of itself.  I think we each took about 2 bites of his dessert, a few spoonfuls of mine and then gave up just before our stomachs exploded.

And then for a little bit of magic.  Aliano&#39;s menu items aren&#39;t super cheap.  They aren&#39;t super expensive either, but I figured that a 4 course dinner (without alcohol) would land us at least $65 or $70.  When the bill came, I joked that it was going to be around $50 after the groupon discount, but I was wrong.  Our bill was $56 before the discount, meaning we got more than a belly full of food for around $45 after tip...my reaction was to pay the bill and leave...fast...before anyone noticed that we got away with highway robbery (oh and not to forget the leftover entrees and desserts).  That&#39;s precisely what we did.  And we shall most certainly return to Aliano&#39;s another day for more delectable Italian food and hospitality.",23/01/13,525,4,2,5,30,8.041500000000001,4.717,3.0959999999999996,37.18900000000001,No,4652

My major complaint was the service.  It wasn&#39;t busy at all. 6 tables on a week night, yet we had to find our waiter after 10 minutes so we could pay. (He was not the only server.)  The waiter also had a very odd aloofness about him that made us uncomfortable.

alianos-ristorante-batavia,Curt R.,C5NdB56J1Ls8-V8j94e4PQ,#NAME?,"Well a short back story. I went early when they opened in 2011 and got probably the worst and slowest service ever by a completely incompetent server. Chalked it up to newness and tried it again a few months later and had even a worse experience with them. I even reached out to ownership with a personal letter offering some honest feedback that went unresponded to. We were given a Gift Certificate to restaurant from a friend for the holiday so decided to give it another go.

It was New Years Eve and I made 615 dinner reservations. We were banking on the 9PM show just a couple of miles away. We were seated promptly and offered water and bread. There was a special New Years menu for 2 and regular menu. My wife ordered a glass of wine and we ordered Calamari, Cesar Salad, and 2 Entrees Bacon Wrapped Scallops and Veal Parmesan. There is a  Eight top to my right that is just finishing up as we are ordering. There is also some Karaoke guy singing and working the tables. A little cheezy but at least they are trying to entertain the guests. About 45 minutes later our salads show up. They are not really drained very well and full of water. C minus .We remind waitress of calamari we are assured it is on its way. 8 top to my left is broken into 2 4tops, cleaned, bussed, and seated in this time. Calamari shows at 90 minute mark. Its good but we are ready to eat. The 4 top to my right gets their dinner even though they were seated 30 minutes after me and I am ready to leave. I have had the singer approach my table more in the time I have been there more than my waitress. When I flag her down I point out to her that we have been there two hours. She apologizes and &#34;SUDDENLY&#34; our food appears. My dish is closer to cold then hot and my wife&#39;s $35 scallop entree has two, yes two scallops on it. I&#39;m fuming at this point. I send my entree back forever, nibble on my wife&#39;s and we end up leaving at the 2 hr 15 min mark. Management does not visit our table but my entree is removed.

China Dragon I can be found in a strip mall of the very busy Algonquin Road. Who&#39;d thunk friendly service and tasty Asian food can be found in such a place? I ordered takeout through Eat24 (they send $2 off coupons almost every weekend) and everything was ready to go as soon as I got there to pickup. Everything was packed very well which no spillage which is an important part of carryout.

I have an obsession with sweet potato rolls and this was the cheapest I think I&#39;ve ever seen on a menu. It&#39;s oddly priced at $4.36 and comes with 6 pieces. I loved it and I&#39;m pretty sure it tasted extra great because of the cheap price tag.

The small sesame chicken is $6.99 and a big portion...I can&#39;t imagine how huge the large is! The flavor on the sesame chicken was sweet and much better than I expected. It was on par with some of the best sesame chickens I&#39;ve had across Chicagoland.

I still think Woow&#39;s rolls and presentation are better for $1 more.

Prior to that, I could have it a couple times a year, but was most always disappointed.  Since I lived in China, I just haven&#39;t been satisfied with &#34;Americanized Chinese.&#34;  Even going to major city Chinatowns and asking for the dishes I preferred would bring a woeful look and an apology &#34;we just can&#39;t get those ingredients in the U.S.&#34;

I usually fare a little better with dim sum - most places haven&#39;t Americanized it as yet.  I suppose that will happen in time.  We&#39;ll see scrambled egg and sausage steamed dumplings, or some such.

Oh well.

One major difference is surely the cost of ingredients in China vs the US.  The Chinese aren&#39;t tempted to saturate dishes with inexpensive &#34;fill&#34; like in the US, and the US restaurants idea of fill is vegetables you&#39;ll never see in China - zucchini, carrots, and such.

And of course, there is always the &#34;American invented&#34; dishes on Chinese menus in the US, like &#34;Crab Rangoon,&#34; supposedly crab flakes, cream cheese and scallions in a deep fried won ton wrapper.  Seems these first appeared at the Polynesian themed chain &#34;Trader Vics&#34; in the mid 50s.  They have devolved to be much heavier on the cream cheese (a product that was never available in Asia until the past few years), and if there is any crab at all, it&#39;s that artificial crab.  Sigh.

I was back in suburban Chicago to see a client and wanted something different, looked for places that would deliver to the hotel, and found China Dragon via one of the food delivery services.   Ordered shrimp with cashews, a couple egg rolls, and the crab rangoon.

The entree was OK, but I didn&#39;t care for the egg rolls at all, there was some &#39;under taste&#39; that I couldn&#39;t identified, and the &#34;rangoons&#34; were completely devoid of crab.

The restaurant does furnish you with ample quantities in the servings, it&#39;s hot, delivered quickly, and inexpensive.  And they furnish you with a couple years worth of soy sauce, sweet and sour, and mustard packets.

china-dragon-i-algonquin,Caitlin L.,wrwhws10-hfM0oeT7WQgFw,pyUIWqjv7gG9I-MEFskjNw,"I have found a wonderfully priced, fresh tasting, and beautifully presented sushi place!
This review is purely TAKE-OUT we did not eat in the restaurant.

I have been searching for a reasonably priced sushi place for a while. From Sushi Station to WoW Sushi to SushiCafe. 
(Jurin is excellent but we don&#39;t usually have the money to buy from them.)

We got Godzilla, Rainbow, Philadelphia, and of course the California for roughly $35. Each were arranged in a pleasing way. None of them crumbled apart. The flavors were delicious; just the right amount of sauce on the Godzilla, and the fish tasted fresh, not frozen or old.

When we called to verify that the &#39;assorted fish&#39; on top of the rainbow roll didn&#39;t have Tilapia.

Side Rant:
*** If any place serves tilapia in sushi it is NOT traditional and is merely to cut costs. They are cheating you out of money, and cheating you out of a good sushi experience. Talking about you Sushi Station. Gross!  ***

 Anyways, the employee who answered the phone was very polite and double checked. Assuring us it would be White Fish or White Tuna. They also accommodated to putting a smaller amount of cream cheese in the Philadelphia roll.

I was weary to place our order due to unflattering or lack of reviews over their sushi. But I figured they had to be better than WOW Sushi. They surpassed! I would put them right up there with Jurin. I will most definitely be placing orders with China Dragon in the future whenever I am in the area.

We ordered two containers of sushi chicken fried rice and the pot stickers. Oh my goodness. It&#39;s a little pricey but we have so much leftover we will be eating it for days. Will definitely be returning here and will definitely tell everyone I know. The food was still hot like it had just been cooked not driven to us and the appearance was mouth watering.

The broth tasted authentic and refused to cool down.  Beef slices were very tender. Bean sprouts, basil, lime, jalepeno were all included along with siracha and hoisin sauce..impressive for takeout/delivery.

My Order:
(s) Pan Fried Noodles
(s) General Tso Chicken
6 Piece Crab Rangoon

Pros:
First off aside from the food the staff was very welcoming and nice to me. They greeted me as I came in and made me feel very welcome. As for the food the vegetables that came with my noodles were crisp and fresh tasting. The crab Rangoon came in a large portion which my family did enjoy. Also the white rice that came with my order was cooked well.

Cons:
The pan fried noodles were nothing like I was expecting. The to go box they came in was mostly packed with large pieces of vegetables that were sitting on top of the noodles. The noodles themselves were at the very bottom of the container and were burnt in spots. 
However, the chicken was the biggest disappoint. It was really hard and dry making it difficult to chew.",12/03/15,119,3,1,3,5,2.0268,1.234,0.8180000000000001,9.948,No,1082

china-dragon-i-algonquin,Tina A.,DwV3BvRZ8sVjqUOJo07Xvw,9h6AAifehgWJRnSrjz7VXA,"I wanted to give China Dragon an updated review since they have remodeled, and now have sushi.

 I want to point out that this update is more of a sushi review then their Thai/Chinese cuisine (which is far superior) that I previously commented on. 

First off the whole left side of the restaurant has been expanded and now has seating, not a very big area, but definitely enough to seat at least 30 people. The ambiance is casual and has a small sushi bar. The hostess seemed a little overwhelmed as I believe they were a little short handed, although there were only a handful of us in the restaurant. My boyfriend and I were seated and given water right away and our orders taken. We got pot stickers, a happy roll (spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, and mango), spicy tuna, and a sweet potato roll. It took a while for our appetizer to come out and our server was apologetic, no biggie...Pot stickers were on point, as usual, no complaints there. Then our sushi came out, presentation was beautiful! Sweet potato roll was tasty, but it&#39;s pretty hard to not get that one right. Then I tried the spicy tuna, at first bite I thought, &#34;mmm pretty good, got a little kick to it&#34;. Then as I proceeded to chew all I could taste was fish, as in fishy fish. Not appealing at all. I gave the roll one last try and again, fish. I moved on to the maki roll, the happy roll and it was better but I think that the mango really masked the fishiness of the tuna (which clearly had an after taste). Not my favorite, at all. I ate all of the sweet potato and only 2-3 pieces of the rolls that contained the fish. My boyfriend being a trooper, finished it off even though he was sloshing it down with his strawberry mango smoothie (which was fantastic!).  We both left disappointed.  

All in all, come to China Dragon 1 for the Chinese, thai, and those delicious smoothies, pass on the sushi. Fish didn&#39;t taste fresh AT ALL. Real bummer since it&#39;s around the corner from me....",31/01/15,237,1,1,4,9,3.2594000000000003,2.162,1.791,18.047,No,1985

There were certain dishes that would be considered a little more adventurous for the suburbs and not considered your standard Chinese take out fare.  For example, they have some Salt &amp; Pepper dishes which weren&#39;t  fantastic but saves a drive to Schaumburg or Chicago and still quite tasty.  Plus this is a dish that in 15 minutes can go from great to okay as it loses its crispness so have to keep that in mind.   Some of their dishes have Korean influences which helps mixed it up as it goes for flavors. 

We tried about 8 different dishes and they were all above average and everything is reasonably priced.  We received a free Chicken Teriyaki dish on our order.  Food was packed well and they have online ordering.

We ordered the following: minestrone soup and the Indian soup. He loved the minestrone and said it was so good he could&#39;ve just eaten a bowl of that and been satisfied for dinner. The yellow Indian soup was a pleasant surprise and had great curry flavor (surprising for an Italian place). 

We came to try the grilled Parmesan halibut  on a recommendation and it did not disappoint. It was delicious! I had the garlic crab pasta which was good too. I really liked how they offer half or full portions for the pasta entrees. It&#39;s nice to have that option when you know you&#39;ll fill up a little on soup and bread rolls before the entree comes.

Patio seating looked good but we opted to eat in the dining room. Our last visit wasn&#39;t our best do to another families misbehaving child. 
A modest menu with a fair variety offered many pasta and  chicken dishes. I went with a Grinder Sandwich. Pastrami, ham and cheese toasted to gooey deliousiness.  The only problem was the thing was so hot the inside burned my mouth. I let the second half sit for sometime to cool but it was still so hot I burned my mouth again. The wife went with the almost world famous crab and pasta salad. This dish has been one of their best for 30 years. They always serve it whenever Geneva has a Swedish days or Festival of the vine at their sidewalk booth. Salad mixed with multi colored pasta covered in crab. In the old days it was all crab. Now it&#39;s 50-50 crab and surimi (fake crab). We happen to love surimi so it still taste great.

chiantis-geneva,Alyssa J P.,PoAc1N3GaOeWdBVSFsleig,bmNYzLesTu3op7q6-eh9zg,"Chianti&#39;s appears to be one of the few Italian restaurants along the Fox that serves plain old pasta marinara. As a vegan in the mood for pasta, that&#39;s pretty much all that restaurant-made Italian food has to offer me.

Chianti&#39;s is slightly tucked away off the main drag in Geneva in a large building, inside looks like an old house from the 70s that was converted into a restaurant that remains the same today. Walking in there was like a time warp. My mom and I were the first customers in, so it was a little eerie.

&#34;Breadsticks&#34; are served on each table; those breadsticks being the individually wrapped crunchy type. My mom and I weren&#39;t sure if this meant we wouldn&#39;t be served real bread with our meal or not. Fortunately, real bread was served with our pasta.

The marinara was satisfying. Not too thick, but not as simple as I prefer in a sauce. The prices were good and the pasta wasn&#39;t under- or over-cooked. One point off for only offering fettucini, spaghetti, angel hair and penne.

The garlic dip and bread sticks are addictive and the meal portions are perfect for us.  We usually order the lunch portion even at dinner and it is always enough to satisfy.  We like to sit up front on the 3rd street side and watch the people walk by and enjoy the beautiful fall day.

We mentioned this to the server, but she didn&#39;t really give us the &#34;first time here&#34; talk; telling us what&#39;s good, recommending food/drinks, telling us about the restaurant etc.... 

We sat in the bar area which is its own little room. We both enjoyed it and were the only two in there which was nice and quiet! However.... We seemed to be forgotten about. It seemed as if our server was in a rush every time she came to check on us. After we had three apps and a few drinks prior to our meal, she seemed to warm up a bit. (Maybe because our check was going to be high or because it was later and the main restaurant wasn&#39;t so busy??) 

For apps had the calamari, bruschetta, and the cheesy mushrooms. Calamari was ok but just a deep fried appetizer you could get at a bar. I wouldn&#39;t recommend the bruschetta, was pretty bland. The mushrooms however were AMAZING. So were our main entrÌ©es. I had the shrimp and broccoli angel hair pasta with a white wine sauce. I got the small, which was more than enough. I was surprised with how low our bill was as we had three apps (although they are half off in July on Tuesdays!) four drinks and two entrees. Bill was around 80$.

We were seated right away and our server attended to us quickly. One of my friends had to catch a train back home at 8:30 so we were in a bit of a hurry, we were grateful for the timely service. 

The restaurant is small, but nice, casual Italian style with white table cloths and dim lighting. I liked the atmosphere, perfect way to end a night out with girlfriends. It was also nice they were open later on a Sunday, most places on 3rd street in Geneva were closed. 

We were so hungry so the first thing we noticed was this white sauce on the table and we wanted some! We thought some bread might come out but then one of us noticed some crispy bread sticks on the far end of the table. The white sauce was a homemade creamy garlic sauce for dipping these sticks and it was delicious! We cleaned the cups of sauce dry before our waitress came back with our waters. The waitress also eventually brought out crispy warm bread rolls which were great too. 

The menu consists of standard Italian fare. I wasn&#39;t in the mood for pasta so my friend and I ordered side salads and split the stuffed mushrooms and the calamari. The salad was  Okay. They make their own dressings so I asked for ranch but it tasted more like sour cream and the salad was just iceberg lettuce with a few veggies, nothing special. The stuffed mushrooms were amazing however! The highlight of the meal. Cheese on top and crunchy on the inside, I would definitely recommend these, especially if you are a cheese lover. I was very disappointed in the calamari. It was very breaded, and there were no actual calamari or even the rings, they were basically just calamari straws. If you are a calamari lover like me, I wouldn&#39;t order them from here. I also tried my friends cheese lasagna and it was wonderful. 

I would go back to Chianti&#39;s, order the mushrooms, skip the salad and try a pasta dish.",06/10/14,215,3,2,5,27,7.7424,4.571999999999999,0.733,17.695,No,1952

We first went here after hearing it was &#34;pretty good&#34; about a month and a half to 2 months ago, and I can not get enough! 

Walking into this place is very nice, it&#39;s smaller and quite cozy, appears to be able to accommodate larger groups as well. The atmosphere is phenomenal as well, nice Italian style music playing in the background, lots of wine and I love the train circling in the front room. 

The always give you bread sticks (long, thin and cracker-like) with garlic dipping sauce (which is also their garlic salad dressing and available for purchase at the front counter) which, being my first food experience here was what sold me. Do not plan on having a nice date after eating this garlic dipping sauce, it packs a punch! But, if you are a garlic lover it is fantastic! I love their soups, minestrone and chicken tortilla have been my favorites so far. Their Caesar salad was good as well, very light and flavorful. Still need to experience the appetizers besides the cheese garlic bread. It was VERY good, just ask for some marinara on the side for dipping.

Now as for the dinner, I have tried to mix it up and try something new each time, I have yet to be disappointed. If you like seafood I highly suggest either the Garlic Crab or the  Linguini &amp; Clams. If you are thrown off by textures go with the crab since clam has the grittier texture. Both were phenomenal! (Get the asiago cheese on the top, it adds even more flavor!) Besides the seafood I have had the Sausage &amp; Peppers and  the ravioli. Their marinara is awesome, very flavorful and the tomatoes are fresh! The best part is most of their dishes are lunch or dinner portioned too so if you are a light eater, not as hungry or starving they have options.

For the food, I&#39;ll give it a solid 3 stars. The wife and I went here on a whim on a Saturday night, while they didn&#39;t have any tables in their &#34;main room&#34;, they had one available in the &#34;bar&#34;.

I didn&#39;t even know they had a separate bar area! As we walked through the main room, the hostess opened up the outside door, we walked about 20 feet outside, and then back in again to a bar area that I&#39;d say holds maybe 20 people at most. There are only 4... yes, 4 stools at the bar itself. We were seated at a small 2 person table-top.

Upon the waitresses suggestion, I ordered up the Parmesan-crusted tilapia on top of sauteed spinach (it was a &#34;special&#34; of the night).  It was delicious, definitely a four-star rating for my plate. I&#39;m a pretty well-rounded seafood eater, and the fish was delicious, and the spinach was cooked just right. The wife ordered a basic pasta dish with tomato sauce (sorry I don&#39;t remember the exact one), and to her it was just average. Not bad by any means, but nothing she raved about afterwards.

I bring it up to a 4-star rating because the ambiance of the restaurant, along with our server, was great. When we return I&#39;ll specifically ask to be seated in the bar section, it was like we were eating in someone&#39;s home (well, with a custom-made bar).

The food was also ok, nothing exceptional but decent Italian classics.  I had the lasagna and it was one of the better things on the table.  Two of my friends ordered sautÌ©ed spinach and it was barely wilted, not appetizing at all.  Salads as starters were pretty good.  I guess one of their claims to fame is this garlic dipping sauce.  I don&#39;t get it.  It&#39;s basically liquid garlic, way too strong for my taste but I know a lot of people like it.  You&#39;re supposed to dip these hard skinny breadsticks that are wrapped in paper into the garlic dip.  That seemed a little lazy to me, some fresh bread would have been nice.

I have nothing good to say about this place The food is way worse than I can make at home.  Panera Bread serves tastier pasta. But beyond the food, the service and management is incredibly bad.  

I considered ordering a sausage and peppers dish on the menu.   Then I hear commotion at the table next to me.  The gentleman had ordered this dish and received it without any peppers in it.  He asked the waitress (who while nice seemed clueless) to bring some peppers and she brought him a bowl of RAW green peppers.  Then, they had the nerve to try to charge him for the extra peppers!  The gentleman had to get with the manager to get them to take it off the bill.

Now to our meal.  My wife, daughter and I had to get up and leave after we had not gotten our meals over an hour after we had ordered.  We dropped cash at the table and just left and went down 3rd street to another establishment.  

The wine selection was awful.  You would think in a gentrified area like 3rd street in Geneva the restaurant could put a little effort into picking a few inexpensive Italian wines that go well with simple cafe fare.  Instead you get the same $6 swill Chianti they sell at Jewel.",06/12/14,139,1,1,0,-31,-0.5756999999999999,0.444,1.0770000000000002,14.478999999999997,No,1272

The quality of the food and the variety is excellent. Some things on the menu here that I haven&#39;t seen elsewhere (dill alfredo? unexpected and FANTASTIC) not to mention their soups were amazing and could have made a meal all by themselves.

I promise it will be worth the chance you give it. I can&#39;t even begin to describe the wonderful experience we had at Chianti&#39;s. But I will :)
     First off, it&#39;s in beautiful Geneva so the drive from Naperville was easy and very pleasant. We had no trouble finding parking and had a short 2 minute walk to the restaurant, which is in the cutest little house on the corner of the street. You walk in to a little front foyer where you wait to be seated after giving your name for your reservation (which you should definitely make). The foyer and the dining area are separated by a curtain which makes the experience all the more exciting and exclusive. 
    The dining room is divided into 2 smaller rooms with booths and tables. The decor is clean and cosy which allows you to focus on why you&#39;re really there...THE FOOD. 
     After reading previous reviews I was itching to get a taste of the famous garlic dressing/dip. I was NOT disappointed. I consider myself a huge fan of garlic and am rarely surprised by garlic dishes but wow! This dip is creamy and garlic-y and fresh! We got the house Chiantis which was reasonably priced ($6 a glass) and that was a perfect choice with the flavors throughout our meal. We of course ordered the stuffed mushrooms which is another popular item and it was excellent. Large portion and so full of flavor. 
     Next we decided on the dinner portions of the Cajun chicken tortalini and the 5 cheese lasagna with bolognese sauce. I feel like you can reasonably judge an Italian restaurant fairly based off of their red sauce. AMAZING RED SAUCE! You can tell it is freshly made with lots of love. The Cajun chicken was spicy, flavorful, and cheesy. The lasagna LITERALLY melted in my mouth...I&#39;m telling you this is life changing lasagna. 
     We finished with sharing the made in house tiramisu (another dish that tells you the quality of a restaurant) and it was beautiful.

Helpful tip - there is a small outdoor patio on Campbell St which is around the corner from the main entrance, it&#39;s off the pedestrian heavy 3rd St and often pretty empty.

I want to start off by saying the waitress was rude. She was attentive but had a bad attitude. What really turned me off about this place was the food. The calamari was definitely poor quality and frozen. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan - also tasted like it was made previously then frozen. Inside was all soggy and the breading was soft. Just gross.

I couldn&#39;t wait to try the mushroom caps filled with cream cheese and baked with mozzarella. Surprisingly I was pretty disappointed in them. Very little flavor to the point I had to dunk them in the garlic dressing just for a boost.

 For the entree I ordered the rib eye. Good size but no flavor. Not even a little salt an pepper, which I ended up adding myself. Also I ordered it mid-rare and it was closer to mid-well. Certainly was not an $18.95 steak. 

My wife got the 5 cheese lasagna which she thought was okay, Sister in law liked the salmon and my brother in law had the cheese ravioli which he said was also okay.

The waitress was fine...she was very nice.  The prices were reasonable.  We enjoyed the bread, soup, and salad.  Then came our main courses...  I had the chicken Alfredo and my husband had the chicken Parmesan.  My Alfredo sauce was really runny and with the first bite I knew I was not going to enjoy my dish at all.  The chicken had no seasoning and it seemed as though it was maybe boiled instead of grilled or something, making it super rubbery.  The sauce had too much pepper  for my liking and something in that dish tasted as though it was from a can or it was frozen for awhile.  Whatever it was, it did not taste fresh.  My husband loves chicken parm and he was very disappointed with his dish as well.  He particularly did not like the chicken.

There were other families and the atmosphere, though romantic, was great for kids too.  The wait staff was very friendly and quick.

The food was excellent - my daughter had the stuffed cheese ravioli with Bolognese sauce and overbaked with Mozzarella which she loved.  Finally an Italian place in the western burbs too that offered grissini!  The freshly baked bread rolls you get were excellent with a nice crust, served warm.

I started with some Minestrone soup (very good) and then had the chicken and peppers alla vodka which was excellent.  Nicely spiced and the lunch size was plenty without overeating.  The house Chianti was also very nice.

My only complaints are that the kid&#39;s menu consists of the standard cookie cutter spaghetti marinara, chicken fingers, etc.  However, since Chianti&#39;s allows you to order most all entrÌ©e in lunch size, that worked out perfect for my daughter as well.

Our server was great and one of the nice things about this place is the other servers help out. Your glass is empty they grab it and fill it for you. I always like to see that because it shows everyone cares about their job.

First, the bright spots. The salad with Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, and carrots was crisp and fresh. The dinner rolls were warm and crispy. The servers were perfectly nice(though they struck me as inexperienced and a little overwhelmed by our questions about the food). It is very inexpensive. 

Onto the horror. My Linguini with Clams was like something a passive aggressive lunch lady would dream up. First of all, it had little hidden bits of crunchy onion in it, when onion isn&#39;t listed as an ingredient on the menu. This would have been fine if it weren&#39;t for the rest of the dish. Instead of the lovely steamed clams I imagined, these were chopped clams from a can that looked like something we would feed our cat to entice her into taking her medicine. All in all, blecch. 

Pity my partner&#39;s Shrimp Scampi were dead, as they no doubt would have enjoyed swimming around in their vast garlic butter reservoir as though performing in a nightmarish gustatory ballet (Prawn Lake). At least that might have livened up the dish, which was as boring as church on Christmas.

Good

1. We got in right away with out a reservation. 
2. The waitstaff was really super nice. Our waitress was nice without being intruding. 
3. Food came out fast! Almost too fast. 
4.They have these prepackaged crispy breadsticks at the table which at first I eyeballed like no they couldn&#39;t be that good and they send out this garlic cream dipping sauce thing...but then I tried it...let me say I would have eaten every breadstick package and the garlic cream dipping sauce was the best. 
5. The location is nice...where you could do some shopping after your meal. 

Not so good

1. The pasta we ordered is something I could have made at home . We ordered vodka pasta and spaghetti and meatballs. It wasn&#39;t bad but it wasn&#39;t fantastic where I would rave about it.
2. The meals came with a salad or soup and rolls but the soup I got was gross. Skip the minestrone soup it is water with vegetables. 
3. The hostess was weird, there is no other word for it I can&#39;t explain it really well it was one of those situations where it was like a robotic friendly? Forced friendliness. 
4. The dessert we had was also very average...once again I could have made it at home. 
5. Yes can we be stingier on the bread? When I get a bread basket of warm rolls I may like 1 or even 2 pieces...if it is that good 3...there was exactly one for me and one for my friend. 
6. The interiors seemed dingy and sticky and there was a horrible smell coming from the kitchen...like a sewage or old food smell. 
7. This last one is not the restaurants fault but there was some party going on in the back and there were 2 children running and screaming in the restaurant. It is dangerous and also very annoying. If I wanted running unsupervised children with my meal I would have went to McDonald&#39;s playland.

Coming from an Italian family, we expected the food to be delicious.  This was a total disappointment.  We started with 2 appetizers, bruschetta and calamari.  The bruschetta was bland, and the calamari was a dark brown in color, small and tiny, tasted like shrimp, and had no distinctive appearance of calamari.  The cheese ravioli were hard, the filling had no flavoring, and the sauce was dark red in color and bitter. The salad dressing, Italian, was horrible.  The only positive, warm buns, they were good, and our waitress was very friendly and accommodating.   The restaurant itself was very warm and humid, and I noticed the back door was open.

Service began with a garlic cream sauce with crunchy breadsticks (I believe imported from Italy).  The garlic sauce was insane! So good.  So unbelievably good. 

The salad was a normal salad, nothing too special - I had a balsamic/olive oil dressing.  For my main dish I had the Chicken Oreganato.  It was ok - the pasta it was served on was on the bland side and the chicken could have had more spice on it, but overall it was still good.

The  calamari was served looking like fried clams instead of calamari and very chewy.  The caprese salad was just okay.  The dinner salad was very good especially the garlic dressing.  

For dinner I had the Cajun chicken tortellini because I had read a review on another site that it was very good.  Well, maybe the cook has changed because it was not Cajun, not spicy  or flavorful at all.  It was quite bland topped with quite a bit of cheese.  The portion, although dinner sized was small compared to most other restaurants.  I would not recommend this dish.  My husband had the sausage and pepper dinner and the sausage was chopped in chunks and lacked flavor and said he would not order it again.  

The hostess was very friendly and accommodating seating us right away.  The server was warm and friendly as well as the bus help. 

We had a booth in the center dining room, but every time the diner behind me moved, I felt like I was being bumped in the back.

The salad again appeared to be packaged greens from the grocery and paid an additional charge for balsamic vinegar which was the best thing about the meal, but I can go the store on State Street and buy my own.  The pasta was overcooked, flavorless, dry and the crab was exceedingly sparse which turned out to be a good thing because it had that old frozen taste.

Environment: Very good, quite a bit of seating. The Ale House has an upscale bar and grill feel, families, younger people, good variety.

Service: Good, very kind young lady was an attentive waitress.

Hungry after a very long day, she stumbled on the Geneva Ale House. Her mapping software brought us to the wrong spot, but after circling the block and looking up at the sign, we were amazed the place didn&#39;t jump out and bite us!

We walked in and were surrounded by regulars. We chose a table about half way back. The bartender/server took good care of us. They have a late night menu and I would easily go back to grab a bite from that menu again. 

We tried the Door County Cheese Curds. At half price, they were perfect!  I would not have been happy paying full price for the portion that appeared in front of us. They were definitely tasty though. The burger was good and the soup was very good. My hubby wanted a grilled cheese sandwich (to-go) and he was happy by the time he was able to eat it. 

Overall, the Geneva Ale House was a good fit for our needs that evening. For late night eats, it&#39;s a win. As far as their regular menu, I&#39;ll have to visit again to find out.",28/11/15,131,4,2,4,29,3.9151,2.983,0.319,12.697999999999999,No,1082

We weren&#39;t here for a romantic date, I was lazy and didn&#39;t feel like cooking, and why not get out of the house on a Friday night?  Geneva Ale House was the perfect spot for a cozy, casual date.  The beer list is a hit, I had the Sierra Nevada Otra Vez and later a chocolate porter.  There were a lot of predictable choices (Two Brothers) as well as some different ones, so there&#39;s something for everyone.

I had the Campfire Burger, cooked medium, and served with a maple BBQ sauce and pork belly on a pretzel roll.  The burger and sauce were fantastic, the subtle smoky flavor complemented the sweet maple.  The pork belly was a thick, overcooked slab that was too chewy - the burger would have been fine without it!

We shared the cheese curds with a bacon aioli.  These were good, but the portion was small for the price.

I liked the neighborhood feel of the place, especially since there are newer, more trendy restaurants popping up in the area.  Geneva Ale House is a little less yuppie than those places.

We were seated right away at a table next to the window. There were a lot of other patrons at the restaurant, but it wasn&#39;t too crowded. I loved the exposed brick throughout the entire restaurant too.

Another thing I loved about dining here was that they served Cider Boys cider. Most places only carry Angry Orchard cider, so I like when bars and restaurants carry more of a variety.

We ordered the cheese curds for an appetizer and the bacon aioli dipping sauce that comes with it was amazing.  My entree, however, left much to be desired. I ordered the fish tacos (because I LOVE fish tacos) and I&#39;m afraid they might not have been cooked all the way. They tasted ok, but I was sick the entire night. :( When I showed my husband the picture of my meal, he couldn&#39;t believe that I ate the food. And, now that I take a closer look at it, the fish in the tacos does look a bit translucent. For a split second, I did think that it smelled  little fishy, but I was so hungry that I ate them all.

geneva-ale-house-geneva,Mark K.,hNlq0BtXl4s_rN-jvKQBOg,eQTsskClhSBghGxF9-nfZQ,"It&#39;s time for an honest assessment of this place.  I noticed the last time I stopped in for dinner, and it had been awhile, that the place was very quiet during prime time dinner time.  Never used to be that way.  Here&#39;s my take, and I offer it as an opportunity for the owner to think about making some changes.

First is the staff.  The bartender, a girl with black hair and has been there forever, needs to get a personality.  Really.  She seems out of it.  Never says hello, barely acknowledges customers, and even for regulars.  She seems miserable.  FYI- The servers are nice, and a couple of them very sweet, but it only takes one.  Second, the food.  The burgers are so good, well seasoned, quality meat, but always overdone.  The cooks can&#39;t get it right.  When you upgrade to a 15 dollar burger you need to get it right and they never, ever do!  We noticed the buns weren&#39;t fresh this last time which really sucked, and the fries seem to have changed to try to keep pace with their restaurant neighbors, i.e. Seasoned.  I prefer traditional, crispy fries.

So, we will likely stick with the Nobel House for pub grub, or one of the other pubs in St. Charles, at least for now.  That said, get some friendly bartenders who don&#39;t have that far away look in their eyes, some cooks who know the difference between medium and well done, and we will return.",15/07/16,167,2,1,2,-13,1.2208,1.172,0.854,17.973999999999997,No,1380

geneva-ale-house-geneva,Suzanne Z.,mYUurN0VcUwdLOZaUTN0gg,#NAME?,"Came here on a frigid Friday night, and was met with a 15 minute wait at 8pm. Not a big deal, so we stayed and headed to the bar. The beer selection here is fantastic- particularly for the canned/bottled beer. I ordered a chocolate cherry stout which was delicious.

We were seated no more than 7 minutes after arrival, with the hostess finding us directly to seat us. We got the dreaded booth spot closest to the door and window, but overall it wasn&#39;t too chilly there. Waters came out after that and we met our nice waitress shortly after that as well.

The ale house is long and skinny, a little cramped, but not too loud where we couldn&#39;t hear each other. The vibe is upbeat, and there is a lot of families there, which was a little surprising, seeing as it is a bar with a strong beer emphasis. 

Our group of 4 ordered the fried cheese curds, because what could be better than fried cheese?? The app was small, more appropriate for two than 4 people. The curds were crispy, with a cheddar? cheese in the middle, but were more breading and air than cheese. The bacon aioli side looked amazing- big chunks of bacon in a thick dip- (I was told it was good), but I couldn&#39;t have it due to Lenten obligations.

I ordered the fish and chips as my meal. It was nice to see a few fish options and 2 veggie burger options to satisfy my no-meat Friday! My counterparts ordered burgers-including the burger sammied between to grilled cheeses. Shortly after ordering, the waitress told us the food would be right out. We were starving, so this was great news, until the food didn&#39;t arrive for 45 minutes!! Majorly upsetting. I get that sometimes a burger or fish dish may take longer, but feel if this is known up front, we should&#39;ve been told this upfront so our hopes wouldn&#39;t have been so high.

Once the food arrived, I received a large plate of fried catfish and fries. The pieces were thin but so LONG! They barely fit diagonally in the take-out box. The fish had a clean flavor and was delicious. Their tartar sauce was SUPER lemony, which wasn&#39;t unpleasant, but definitely different. The fries were hot and good, but I&#39;ve had better. The coleslaw was majorly funky, though. I took a bite and immediately thought I had eaten bacon. Upon asking, the waitress stated it&#39;s just how it&#39;s seasoned. But it was bitter and so artificially smoky-smelling that one bite was more than enough. The fact that I threw up the next day two made me wonder about that stuff.

Overall, everyone liked but not loved their food and experience here. I&#39;d come back for the beer, but that&#39;s about it.",23/02/15,299,3,2,5,45,4.548100000000001,3.6929999999999996,2.051,28.256999999999998,No,2626

First and foremost, they have an amazing beer selection, one of the best in the Tri-Cities. The vast majority of it is bottled, however. They have Church Street Heavenly Helles, one of myfaves, so major props for that. 

I&#39;m not one to go to a bar just to drink; there needs to be some good grub to go with it. And the ale House delivers. Their black forest turkey sandwich is one of the best turkey sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had. A lot of turkey with smoked bacon and honey mustard on a pretzel roll, it&#39;s an excellent combo. Also, don&#39;t skip the onion rings. they come out thick and crispy with a side of spicy ranch with avocado mixed in. Also, when you first bite into the ring, the whole onion doesn&#39;t come out, which is a cardinal sin. The ale house burger is very good as well. Mine was cooked perfectly medium, although I wish the patty could have been a little thicker. It just seemed I had more pretzel roll than burger. Also, they have very good fresh cut fries, which I like to dip in their garlic aioli.

This is for the crafty beer tourist who gets caught in the trap believing that nothing is actually something, or your a local who drinks Geneva Kool Aid with the willingness to wait for extended periods of time for a table of glorified bar food.

The wait staff and &#34;some&#34; bar tenders all wear rose colored glasses...because they are all on vacation congregating at the kitchen door. That&#39;s a jam session that just doesn&#39;t end.

By all means, don&#39;t ask for a domestic beer, you&#39;ll receive a quip...&#34;not at this establishment&#34;. In my opinion, PBR is the original craft beer...remember, it won a Blue Ribbon!

The burgers are hit or miss with a choice of Angus, Grass Fed, Wagyu or Dry Aged with an up charge for each selection. My question, how do you really know? However rest assured, the obligatory fish taco is on the menu!  Damn, most side sauces offered to compliment your meal are the equivalent of a scoop of Hellmann&#39;s.

We started out with the prosciutto/mozz sticks, which were good, but we couldn&#39;t taste the prosciutto.

My wife and I used to live in St. Charles and really miss the vibrant restaurant scene so we were excited to try a place that didn&#39;t exist when we were foodies in this area.  Especially with solid yelp reviews!

I am always nervous when reviewing an Alehouse especially when we&#39;re eating.  Many times I have come across very imbalanced restauralehouses that try to straddle the fence and fail on both accounts.

I&#39;ll start with the beer menu... A+
For a two year old Alehouse the investment they&#39;ve placed in their craft beer menu is really amazing.  Very impressive!

We started our dinner with an appetizer order of cheese curds and calamari.

The cheese curds were cooked perfectly and fried the same. A+. But I will not remember them.  Because the were fully upstaged by the cheesy bacon grease sauce they were served with. A++++++++
I could go into detail about this sauce that changed my life........ But I won&#39;t.  You have to try it yourself to understand.  ;)

The calamari was prepared well and unique, but the sauce was practically all mayo and there was a clump of calamari stuck together the size of a softball. B-

I decided to order soup and an appetizer for my dinner.  

The soup of the day was described by our waitress as &#34;chicken and rice&#34;.......  For me that is the dry toast of the soup world.  So I went with the French onion (a classic!).

The frog onion soup tasted good.... But failed the crusty melted phenomenal cheese test.  B.    Gotta broil the cheese people!!!

I  had for dinner the pork belly tacos with roasted poblano sauce and peaches. A++
Only two complaints.... 1. The poblano sauce burnt my face off.  2. More pork belly of course!

I was really impressed with both the beer selection and the quality and uniqueness of the food.  Ambiance is minimal and service got the job done.  I&#39;ll be back!",26/07/14,223,4,1,3,6,2.561499999999999,2.4680000000000004,0.7250000000000001,22.808,No,1941

They have a decent draft beer selection, but a huge bottle beer selection and their bottle prices are pretty reasonable.  We decided to try the cheese curds as an appetizer and they were just okay, although the bacon aioli that was served with them was great.  I decided to have the burger as the main course, served on a toasted pretzel roll with fries, it was cooked to perfection and had a great flavor.

I was a little sad to see and taste that one of their beers on tap that I ordered at the time wasn&#39;t so, instead I got a lukewarm beer from a pitcher poured into a glass.

I had been communicating with the manager via email about this reservation and he assured me it would be no problem. When I called to confirm I was told they dont hold tables so I was a little worried as this was a business function. I was also told he had my name and # and if there was an issue they would call me. As luck would have it there were no issues and we were seated immediately. The server was prompt and friendly. My only issue was the noise level. It is very loud. The server could hardly hear us. I also wished she had told us when we ordered that the appetizer portions were small and we would need double. But we just ordered more.  We tried the calamari which didnt look real appetizing to me but everyone ate it. We also tried the fried pickles which were pretty tart. The chicken quesedilla was good and the cheese curds were as well. But again, small portions. I had the burger with cheddar, onion straws and bbq sauce. I ordered it medium, it wasnt.

geneva-ale-house-geneva,Leslie S.,rbQp0U49dlq-IcC9d3uBdw,NYFRtZhExBvE_KcCxXXxXw,"I have tried the Ale House several times now, and while I really love the concept (who doesn&#39;t love beer flights?), I have not been overly impressed by the food or decor. I think a little tweaking to the menu and some interest on the walls would really pick this place up.

The beer selection at the Geneva Ale House cannot be beat locally. The menu offers an incredible range of domestic and international beers, and they frequently change with the seasons. The bartenders are very good about making recommendations based on your interests, likes/dislikes.

The food at the Ale House is your typical bar fare: burgers, onion rings, etc. They do have a few interesting items, such as Chicken and Waffles or Slow Roasted Pork Belly Tacos, but I usually order the mini chicken sandwiches, as there are not very many items that interest me (I am not so much a fan of waffles with sriracha, personally, and whomever created the menu must not have been either, as it is very badly misspelled on there!). The mini sandwiches are fine, but nothing special.

The decor is a bit lacking - there are a handful of random pictures and beer signs on the red-painted walls, but nothing that says &#34;ale house&#34; or even &#34;Geneva.&#34; It actually bothers me that the decor is so generic.

The staff is not overly friendly here either, which I suppose is also part of the reason my husband and I do not often come. They serve you as needed, but do not go out of their way to check on you or chat.

Overall, I would say this is a middle-of-the-road bar/restaurant with the potential to be much more.",08/12/14,178,3,1,1,-29,0.7263,1.0699999999999998,0.8570000000000001,12.073000000000002,No,1594

I was sold on this place because they have cheese curds on the menu - a rare thing for Illinois, though not so much Wisconsin.

We got here on a Saturday night for dinner around 7 - prime time for sure!  Yes, there was a wait, and the place is smaller than I imagined so the bar area in the back was pretty crowded as many were waiting for tables.  I felt bad for the restaurant staff who had to work around this crowd hovering around the bar area.  I think the set up is a little awkward in here, especially for the dinner crowd.  

Once we were seated, about 20ish minutes later, I forgot about the chaos of the wait.  In fact, while we were waiting we grabbed a beer - their menu is extensive and I know ZERO about craft beer so I grabbed an Ace Pumpkin Cider being October and all, and I had this beer a few weeks ago while out to lunch.  

We got seated and our service was great - we settled on a few appetizers and a flight of beer each.  You can get a flight of three beers for $9 which was fine by me, again I know nothing about beer so based on the descriptions I choose three and they paired well with my food.  As for our appetizers we were VERY pleased....we got the cheese curds and the bacon aioli to dip it in was AWESOME! I&#39;m used to marinara or ranch but this was great.  We got the October &#34;special&#34; appetizer - mozzarella and prosciutto sticks which were mozzarella sticks but the cheese was wrapped with prosciutto and breaded and OH SO GOOD!  We also split an order of sliders which came on little pretzel rolls.  Everything was great, we were very satisfied, and for dessert we got the fried cheesecake.

geneva-ale-house-geneva,N E.,jrBffP2hdXS6wqXGIBKh-Q,r76LUwlVsXgBIqwnlt0QdQ,"Geneva Ale House is a unique and trendy restaurant. It took us a while to decide on what to order because every single item on the menu sounded delicious! Eventually, we decided to start with the cheese curd appetizer. Having had cheese curds in Wisconsin, I was a bit skeptical about how these would measure up. Fortunately, they were fantastic. Maybe it was the bacon aioli that accompanied them, or the fact that they were fried to perfection. Regardless, I would definitely order them again.


I ordered the artichoke chicken Panini at the recommendation of our waitress, and my friend ordered the Reuben. Both were outstanding, and the portion sizes were huge! The flavors of my Panini were very complex; there was so much going on between the vegetables, chicken, and pesto. I ordered it with the sweet potato fries which were the perfect combination of sweet and savory; they were highly addictive. My friend said her Reuben, with its melt-in-your-mouth house-made corned beef, had the perfect sauerkraut-to-Thousand Island ratio and wasn&#39;t at all dry, as Reuben&#39;s often are.


The prices were fair, and the service was top-notch. Our waitress was enthusiastic and friendly, as was the bartender. We will definitely return, because there are so many more things on the menu that we want to try!",26/07/14,138,5,2,5,23,6.311100000000001,3.364,0.141,11.495,No,1309

geneva-ale-house-geneva,Dan S.,81fr37MM4GR62S2yvOt3gA,ryRU79w17mqzI3TGijXdyw,"I&#39;d actually give this place 4.5 stars.  The only detriment I found was that it was louder than I&#39;d have liked and we waited a little longer than we were told. 

Kelly &amp; I arrived on a Friday night at 6:30.  I had read reviews that the place gets really busy &amp; was expecting a post work/happy hour Friday night crowd.  We walked in and were told about 20 minutes.  There was a seat at the bar so we waited there.   

The overall feel of this place is very warm with burgundyish colored walls.  It&#39;s fairly small inside as well with 10-15 tables.  There was only 1 stool at the bar so she sat while I stood.  We were given the beer menu.  Quite the extensive beer menu! I&#39;d say in total maybe 150-160 beers to choose from, but none of your standard domestic beers. The beers are all sorted by types: IPA, ciders, stouts, ambers, growlers, etc. I tend to like the lighter, cleaner, crisper, sweeter beers while Kelly loves her a good chocolatey stout.  Luckily, she had an app that describes the beers.  I went with a honey amber which was pretty good.  Kelly ordered some birthday cake/batter beer which she really enjoyed.  

The hostess came &amp; got us about 30-40 minutes after we had arrived. It was a little disappointed we waited longer than expected but from what we could see, nobody had even left while we&#39;d been there.  The waitress we had was very good, nice, etc.   We ordered the fried cheese curds with bacon aioli as an appetizer to start.  They were very good. The aioli was way more mayonnaise than bacon IMO but it complemented the curd well.  We both ordered burgers.  Kelly had the Alehouse burger (bacon, fried egg, cheese, grilled onion) with house chips while I had the Campfire burger (cheddar, maple BBQ pork belly, onion straws &amp; maple chipotle BBQ sauce) with sweet tater fries.   I ordered a flight of beer while she ordered a growler of the creme brÌÈlÌ©e beer which she had before &amp; loves.  The beer flight was a nice deal but I wasn&#39;t in love with any of the 3 options I had selected.  

As far as the burgers and sides,  Kelly had a burgorgasm.  She loved it and the house chips.   My burger was pretty good!  It wasn&#39;t quite as juicy as I&#39;d hoped &amp; I didn&#39;t really taste the pork belly all that much but was a good burger nonetheless &amp; one I would order again. .  The chipotle BBQ sauce was a little spicy but not bad at all.  I don&#39;t do spice &amp; I could handle this level of heat. It&#39;s a laid back, subtle heat that just says &#34;hello vicar&#34; after a bit.    The sweet tater fries were very good!  I&#39;d go back just for the beer options &amp; these fries alone.   Hot, soft, fresh with some sea salt on them.   

Service on the night was very good.  Our waitress stopped by at just the right times &amp; my water glass was never really empty.    No complaints at all, especially given how busy this place was. 

Overall, a very enjoyable experience &amp; I look forward to trying to broaden my beer palette here.   We&#39;ll definitely be back!",04/04/15,354,4,3,5,80,9.797899999999998,7.046999999999999,0.9189999999999999,33.034,No,3058

BEER -  They have an extensive beer menu that includes roughly 150 crafts.  Their selection is broad enough to please any palette and features a good deal of choices that I really enjoy.

Simple interior, but good decor, lots of flat screens to catch the game.

Excellent sandwiches, appetizers, and entrees as well. Hearty fare to go with heavier beers, or lighter fare for dieters. Stuff for vegetarians too, including an amazing sounding quinoa burger.

I had the BLT with a side of sweet potatoes fries--it was a great blt with a neat special sauce. Crunchy bread, excellent, thick-cut bacon. The sweet potato fries were overcooked and burnt tasting, topped with a sprinkle of powdered sugar. I had a bottle of the Dogfish Head Peche and hated it, so I ordered a sprite and made my own shandy--much better.

He had the quesadillas and ordered an extra side, of fries. Delicious fries, well cut, seasoned perfectly which come with a little dipping sauce which tasted like mayo, sour cream, and some sort of herb. Very tasty indeed. The guacamole that came with the quesadilla had a spicy bite that I enjoyed.

We ordered beers...what kind? eh for me it didn&#39;t really matter it was a white Belgium variety. I don&#39;t drink a lot of beer. I am not a beer snob. I drink Michelob. The beer was a recommendation of the waiter. If you LIKE beer, there are 4.56 million on the menu so knock yourself out. 

We ordered the cheese curds. about 5 came out to us in a little bowl. They were really good, but if you want to share with more than 1 person, order more than one. The dipping sauce tasted like mayo with some bacon in it. You&#39;d think that would taste good but it really does taste like a mouthful of mayo...with a little bacon. It&#39;s a little gross. I know, because you see &#34;Bacon Aoli&#34; and you think WIN...not a win. wished for a different dipping sauce. 

I ordered the special burger - 50% ground beef and 50% andouille. Although their andouille was very mild, the addition was totally welcome. It was a nice flavor. The burger came with asaigo cheese and sauteed peppers. messy but all of it worked really well.

My husband ordered the Cubano which was the best Cubano I have ever tasted and it can feed 17 people...or two. The pulled pork was really well done and it was on great bread. Seriously, this may be the best thing on their menu. 

We both ordered the sweet potato fries. The small one had the cheeseburger kids menu with regular fries and upon tasting one, I realized that the sweet potato fries are the better option for sure. They are crisp and light and soft inside and salted perfectly. Get them. 

The only downside really is that the total bill was a little pricey, even for Geneva, even for pretentious beer. I don&#39;t expect Panera prices, but it was a little more than it needed to be.

I had the grilled cheese with bacon and house made chips- it really hit the spot! The chips were perfect, thing and crunchy. I also got to try a bite of the sriracha chicken and blue cheese waffles, which was pretty spicy, and had to many conflicting flavors IMO.

If you have seen my reviews, you already know that any place that has good craft beer and burgers is a place that I need to be.  Geneva Ale House delivered on both accounts.

(Sidenote:  I was surprised that they asked for a temp for a stuffed burger, but I went with medium, and it came out overcooked.

Items of note were the bacon dipping sauce for the cheese curds, the grilled cheese burger which uses grilled cheese sandwiches instead of buns for a burger, and the fantastic beer menu.

First the good news: Great tap selection, really good bottle selection. Good burger, other than the Turano pretzel bun that turns into a matzo cracker when you start to wolf it down...

Now, the bad news: What&#39;s with the 2&#34; of head on the Belgian ales? And why is all the beer just slightly cooler than ambient temperature? And what&#39;s with the music -- a stereo stuck ceiling high with two speakers? Really? Put a decent sound system in - please!

More bad news -- the &#34;Cubano&#34; came out looking like a quesadilla - no, really. If you can&#39;t get decent Cuban bread and a press, drop it from the menu. Most of the other sandwiches looked good, though.

Great crowd on a Friday night though. Get a good beer-tender behind the bar, upgrade the stereo, refine the menu, and this place will ROCK! Stand by for an update soon...",20/03/10,120,3,2,3,24,2.2978,2.283,0.6970000000000001,10.02,No,960

geneva-ale-house-geneva,Jen K.,ARxC9nTVYkcuUaXTjcdCUQ,Yrn6eOAZrRviE4bJsgsgbQ,"I was pleasantly surprised with this bar. My husband was a big fan...which is saying a lot, he&#39;s a tough guy to impress, food AND beer-wise. It&#39;s a small, unassuming place with little decor. When we walked in at 7:30pm on a Saturday night, the host said, &#34;Sit anywhere you&#39;d like&#34; and there was ample seating available. Not always a good sign, why wasn&#39;t the place packed for dinner? 

We were promptly greeted and ordered beers right away. While it does not have the most extensive draft menu I&#39;ve seen, the bottle and draft menu were both impressive for a small place. Lots of craft options! I think beer lovers will be pleased all around. I had Solemn Oath Mr. Innappropriate (wheat beer) and my husband ordered the Boulder Honey Saison...his was great. If you go there and they still have this, I highly suggest it. 

GET THE CHEESE CURDS. Omg, get them. They are heavenly. It&#39;s a perfect size portion for two people, maybe not four people (but then again, we can pack away a LOT of food), but they come with this amazing bacon aioli. We thought it was cheese sauce at first, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s just that flavorful. We were basically licking the bowl when we were done.

I ordered the Ale Burger, which came with LTO, grilled onions, bacon, and a fried egg. I ordered it med-rare and it came on a pretzel bun. The toppings and burger were melt-in-your-mouth, while the pretzel bun helped hold it all together. The burger patty wasn&#39;t overly juicy or messy, which was great because so many med-rare burgers I order are good but falling apart. This burger was the perfect overall texture. My husband and I both said our burgers were the most memorable we&#39;ve had in awhile!

$50 later (two burgers, two beers, one app), we were really full and happy. I was able to take half my burger home too! I ordered the fries which were just ok and a little soggy, and my husband ordered the fried onions (delicious...get those instead of the fries). I like this place because it isn&#39;t pretentious but has every right to be.

Price wise was just right. U can come in and ask which pierogies u want. U will have a selection of meat, cheese, potatoes, etc. it would cost 7.99 for 9 from what I remember. They have other Polish foods available such as Borsch, kielbasa (sausage), and blintzes.

ej-pierogi-elk-grove-village,Catherine P.,#NAME?,2XToPu719fG5OjSTevul5Q,"When was the last time I said &#34;let&#39;s go out for Polish food?&#34; 

Answer: never. 

It was a Friday afternoon. We&#39;re out of turkey for sandwiches and the hubby says we&#39;ll just go out for lunch today since we&#39;re out of turkey. Ok, no problem. 

Friday morning at the office, I decide to ask my &#39;work mom&#39; if she would like to be my lunch date today and she accepts.

I&#39;m pretty much over all the same average food in the Elk Grove area and being restricted to a half hour lunch, you can&#39;t travel too far to dine out so I jumped on Yelp to see if there are any new places in the area and up pops EJ Pierogi! 

After reading a few reviews, we decided to make this our lunchtime destination. Our coworker (who is Polish, btw) kinda invites himself to join us for lunch after my work mom offered to bring him back something and let me tell you, I&#39;m so glad he did. He totally turned out to be our Polish ambassador! I found myself asking him what was what and would I like this or that?

At first, I wasn&#39;t sure if the lady behind the counter didn&#39;t like me but it turned out she was very kind and informative. By the end of our visit, she was growing on me and seemed very appreciative of me taking photos to post online to advertise their adorable establishment. 

Now this place is not located in the nicest building, but they really transformed what used to be a subway into a cute neighborhood place. They are located in the same building as the quick oil change place and next to a rundown hotel, but when you&#39;re inside this restaurant, you kinda feel like you&#39;re at someone&#39;s home (someone with a hot bar, that is).  The dÌ©cor is minimal but the place is clean and tidy. The dining area is open and if they were packed full of people, it would not feel too crowded by any means.

They have all kinds of pierogis. Fruit, meat, potato and cheddar, cheese, mushroom, you name it! 

Did you know how filling pierogis can be? Neither did I! 

The two and a half of the NINE pierogis I ordered were fabulous. For pierogis, that is. I don&#39;t know much about them but they were tast-teeeeeee!!!

I did make time to ask &#34;what is the meat in the &#39;meat&#39; pierogis?&#34; and she informed me that it&#39;s a mixture of pork and beef. Thank goodness. I was a little scared there for a minute.

We were there a while waiting for them to fix up some blintz and soup, so we did figure out that if we ever want to dine here again, we would have to call in our order ahead of time. While we waited, we ask a lot of questions about different items on the menu and while I was walking around snapping pictures like a tourist in Italy (or Poland. maybe), I saw they make goulash!!! Now, I&#39;ll tell you a little something about me. As picky as I am about my food, and as much of a scaredy cat I can be when it comes to trying new things, I grew up with a European step-father. He used to make goulash and cabbage rolls and all sorts of things you wouldn&#39;t imagine I would ever try, but I did try these things growing up and really found I like a lot of these different foods. Keep the cabbage away, but I&#39;ll eat the stuffing inside in a cabbage roll or give me goulash any day of the week! I&#39;ll eat that stuff up! So I decided the next time we go, I will order the goulash if they have it available. 

We saw a sign for &#34;finger dumplings&#34; and asked what they are...we were informed they are little potatoes...but they take 7 minutes to make so we&#39;ll have to get those next time. 

Both of my coworkers ordered the Borscht soup. He liked it a bit more than she did. It didn&#39;t look too appetizing to me. They did have a chicken and dumpling soup on the menu that I debated ordering but glad I didn&#39;t because that would have just been too much food! He had the Kielbasa sausage and cabbage with potatoes and inhaled it! Both my work mom and I stuck with the pierogis and blintz as our main dish. I like the pierogis. It&#39;s not something I would eat regularly, but I did enjoy my lunch. I was a little surprised at how filing the pierogis can be!! I think it&#39;s the dough. It&#39;s pretty heavy. Like I said, I ate 2-1/2 of my pierogis and sent the rest home with my coworker because I wasn&#39;t going home after work nor did I think they would keep for another day or two. 

EJ Pierogi has a coupon deal on www.restaurant.com available for $2.00 with a $5 value with a minimum purchase of $7.50 so you can save a few dollars here. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back. Next time, I&#39;m sharing an order of pierogis with someone else or trying the goulash and definitely getting an order of those finger dumplings!!! I&#39;m so happy that I tried something new. I was not disappointed!",08/10/13,509,4,1,5,5,12.3848,7.522000000000001,1.4029999999999998,46.07299999999999,No,4773

We took advantage of the 50% off coupon and went to town on that menu!

We ordered:
- Red Borscht - classic and tasty with those mini dumplings
- Kraut &amp; mushroom pierogies - new flavor to me and fantastic
- Potato &amp; cheddar - my new favorite. Serious comfort food in a dumpling!
- Meat - meh, the meat was on the dry side and didn&#39;t really pack an flavor making for a sandy texture.
- Spinach &amp; cheese - excellent savory choice with plenty of spinach.
- Pyzy Meat - pretty much the star of the show. It&#39;s like a round, meat stuffed dough ball of fluffy, chewy deliciousness. Little pockets of heavenly comfort food is what they were. These must be eaten fresh because they get hard after a night in the fridge and don&#39;t soften up with heat.

The place is immaculate. Clean and a modern interior. I&#39;d have no problem staying here to eat. Nevertheless, I was getting a big order for the family and had to get home.

We ordered:
12 Potato Pierogis
3 Spinach Pierogis
3 Meat Pierogis
3 Kraut &amp; Mushroom Pierogis
3 Cheese and Potato Pierogis
2 Polish &#34;Hamburger&#34; Patties
Dumplings
Polish Sausage
3 Cheese Blintzes

The Pierogis are great. A good size but not too doughy. I particularly liked the Spinach Pierogis.

The Polish &#34;Hamburger&#34; patties were good. My wife did not like hers as much as I liked mine. The ones we normally get at another place are saltier, which apparently my wife prefers. I actually liked EJ Pierogis patty more because it was not as salty.

My wife and kids loved the dumplings. They were all gone without minutes. I&#39;m not a big fan of dumplings so I have to take their word. The dumplings were larger than your typical Silesian dumplings.

The polish sausage was huge. Flavorful and well cooked. They even added cooked onions. The sausage by itself, on a roll or bread, could have easily been somebody&#39;s lunch.

Finally...the blintzes. OUTSTANDING. Sweet cheese on the inside and a soft dough on the outside. They sprinkle butter and sugar on them too. Blintzes are a tricky thing---sometimes there&#39;s too much dough and too little filling and vice versa. This place has it down to a science. I have to say they were the best cheese blintzes I&#39;ve ever had.

For all this food we paid $39. We had a $5 restaurant.com gift certificate so it was $34. Really not that bad of a price considering all the food. It fed a family of four and we had leftovers. 

I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant. They even serve goulash, soup, and some kind of mushroom and melted mozzarella sandwich that looked amazing.

The polish sausage had a crisp tight casing and the meat was well seasoned.The sausage was accompanied by a creamy cooked cabbage and mashed potatoes. They we&#39;re velvety and smooth. 
I had started with a delicious Borscht soup with mushroom pierogi gently submerged in fragrant, rich tangy broth. It was one of the most sensuous meals I&#39;ve ever had! 
Our hostess was attentive and available, seeking our opinion with every presentation. 
The atmosphere was as casual as it was affordable! It&#39;s a MUST GO, if you&#39;re at all interested in a passionate, yet unpretentious presentation of Polish cuisine!

Nothing I said was exaggerated.
I even posted a picture of the receipt as proof.

Basically...
they put onions in my food even though it said no ONINOS on my receipt. 

Not only was my order wrong  and not only was ONIONS spelt wrong....but the wait time and subtle rudeness was included in my review.

I decided to give them a second chance.
I called today, and the voice of the rabbit who answered  sounded like the same goat that took my order the last time. I had to repeat myself 3 times. After the 3rd time, I told him to &#34;nevermind&#34;. I hung up the phone.

I got a kung pao tofu ($9) and a small order or broccoli in garlic sauce ($5). Unfortunately, you can&#39;t get brown rice here, so I went without.

The kung pao tofu was really tasty---it had a savory brown sauce with slivers of garlic and a medley of colors and textures. I wish they had put more tofu in the dish and less celery (the dish seemed to be 50% celery by volume), but the dish still tasted good and came in a large portion.

The garlic broccoli was also good, but I thought the sauce was a tad too sweet on this one. Just a tad. In both dishes, the sauces were more liquid than solid, which is a good thing because some Chinese restaurants over-do it on the cornstarch, leading to gelatinous sauces.

The service is friendly, if harried, during the lunch hour.

My issue was with the dine-in service. I had better help from the lady who was cleaning the floors than the manager!
We took my grandmother here as it&#39;s one of the few places she likes to eat from, but decided to dine-in instead of doing our normal carry out. The management and staff were anything but accommodating. I understand this is not McDonald&#39;s have it your way, but we were making a request to order a small order of one of their menu items. My grandmother does not each much and ordering a large would have been a waste of food. The waitress said they only do large size and would not allow us to order the small size. When she brought the manager over he confirmed that they were unwilling to accommodate our request and they only allow a small size to be ordered for carry out. I could understand if they didn&#39;t allow it at all but they have the option on their carry out but wouldn&#39;t allow us to order it in house. 

When we mentioned that we may just leave because it didn&#39;t make sense to order more food then we would eat the manager said that&#39;s fine go somewhere else.

For me that was the last straw. Your food may be ok, but I live in America the land of choice. IF my business is not important to you enough to accommodate a request that really allows you to save supplies and avoids being wasteful AND if you&#39;re more than willing to accommodate me taking my business elsewhere I&#39;m happy to oblige. You&#39;ve now lost a 3 consistent customers because you wouldn&#39;t make one small (literally) accommodation.

I work hard for my money and i&#39;m happy to spend it on local business&#39; that value their customers. This place is not one of them.


Side note: for the lady who was cleaning the floors that night. Thank you! my grandmother needed Equal for her tea (which they didn&#39;t have) and she came from out of nowhere and offered her splenda from her own purse to use. I hope good things come around for your small, but much appreciated deed. A bright spot in place with poor customer service.",24/11/15,213,1,2,4,42,3.6553,2.99,0.966,19.042999999999996,No,2167
wangs-garden-aurora,Patrick H.,FJf9ytjOQLZm7w3J4ZugiA,R1nX5XfdSujwXogW2CSmlQ,"Wang&#39;s Garden is pretty good for the area.  It&#39;s a shame that we don&#39;t have better Chinese Restaurants around here.

The first thing I use to judge a Chinese Restaurant is their Egg Rolls.  Here they are hit or miss.  Sometimes they taste a little old and not very crispy.  Other times they are spot on.  So if I average it out it&#39;s mediocre.

Then it&#39;s the fried rice.  Which again is mediocre.  Some of the ingredients are cut too big, so they don&#39;t cook the same.  I find if I pile on the soy sauce, it&#39;s not bad though.

I&#39;ve had a couple of other dishes, but I tend to stick with sweet and sour chicken 90% of the time.  And theirs can be soggy sometimes.  It might be because of the steam overcooking them while I&#39;m driving home. 

One thing I can say for sure about them is they are super fast.  If you call it in they will say it&#39;ll be ready in 10 minutes... I walked in once in 5 and it was done.

So 3 stars seems like a fair rating for a place like this.  It&#39;s not great, but it&#39;ll do.",02/12/14,102,3,1,3,6,2.2652,1.902,1.061,15.037,No,1044

The noodles had a perfect texture - just heaven to put in your mouth.  The flavor was great and the portion was plenty.

The sushi came last and was great!  The salmon had a great texture and flavor - very melty.  We had a spider roll that was very good other than maybe too much nori that hung around at the end of the bite.  We also had a godzilla and Aurora roll and both were tasty.

So I tried a few things of each. I had basic fried rice and lo mein plus spare ribs and crab Rangoon from the Chinese end. I figure if they can&#39;t make these right then they have no business being open. Excellent on all accounts! Even my four year olds gnawed on the ribs with joy! Pork fried rice was really good. They use that yummy Chinese BBQ pork (you know the kind that&#39;s reddish?). Lo mein was simple and tasty. Just right. Good crab Rangoon too. Maki rolls were superb for the price. As good as most Japanese restaurants and less expensive. The pad Thai was a little underwhelming. Flavor was good. Not great. Noodles a little dry too.

I sat down and waited patiently. After about 10 minutes she finished taking the phone order. Instead of taking care of me she proceeded to take in other walk ins knowing that I was there first.

Something seems to have changed.  Got take out.. my usual.  Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken, egg roll and chicken fried rice.  When I get Chinese, I almost always get sweet n sour chicken.  So I think I&#39;m a pretty good connoisseur of it.  

I was happy when this place opened, close to my home. I enjoyed their more tender tempura batter and the chicken was good.. it was a good ratio of chicken to batter.  Now, it seems there is more batter than chicken and a lot of the pieces, the batter was a crunchier texture.  The chicken seemed like skinnier strips, rather than the chunks it used to be.  

I&#39;ve never been a big fan of their egg rolls, but they seemed even worse, today.  Drier, less flavorful. 

The fried rice was for my husband, but I took a little of it.  I don&#39;t remember there being peas in it before??  Maybe they have always put peas in their fried rice, but I can&#39;t stand peas in fried rice. Bluck!

wangs-garden-aurora,Jim K.,0mgZF0Z0JGRrbfSXjp3XRQ,slquqU6O4vEUXCr4dMP-Jg,"My lovely wife and I have been craving sushi for a few weeks now after the Holidays.  We had made reservations at our local favorite in Batavia but after a VERY hectic work week, we just didn&#39;t feel up to getting dolled up, going out on the town, and dealing with Randall Road traffic, particularly with the threat of ice/sleet/snow in the weather forecast around the dinner hour.

Thanks to all our Yelper friends, we gave Wang&#39;s Garden a call after checking out the menu online.  The fact that it is a 10 minute drive away is a BIG plus, though we were wishing for delivery.  

A lot of the reviews we&#39;ve seen here are for the Chinese side of the menu, but the sushi craving needed to be satiated, so sushi it had to be.

We started with the Lollipop appetizer, which couldn&#39;t have been more delicious and refreshing.  Artistically wrapped in cucumber, it was a winner.

An assortment of nigiri was very good, and at a great price point.  I do wish one of my favorites, Uni (sea urchin), was on the menu, but what we had was enjoyable except for one small bone in a piece of the Yellowtail. Unagi, another favorite, was yummy.

We also ordered some Maki...Aurora, Mexican and Spider.  All were excellent, but by far my favorite was the Mexican.  We love cilantro (and its infant form, coriander) and the addition of cilantro and jalapeno to this roll just sent it over the Moon! 

Comparing the Chinese menu to our local Aurora favorite that offers delivery (see my review) showed that Wang&#39;s was a little more expensive for a lot of things, but it seems like the overall opinion on Yelp is favorable.  We&#39;ll have to try that side of the menu sometime.

Spicy choices are indicated on the menu with a red pepper and on request can be prepared &#34;extra spicy&#34;.

I am a big fan of hot and sour soup and Wang&#39;s Garden includes a larger than average bowl with lunch, as well as your choice of crab rangoon or egg roll appetizers.

The waitstaff gives service rivaling much pricier places in the area- we were treated like valued customers and every request was taken care of immediately. The waitstaff is also friendly and fun without being intrusive.

The decor is what I like to call &#34;Asian New&#34; and the dining area was spotless and inviting.

A couple that came in before us got &#34;freaky fast&#34; service for their take out order. It was absolutely amazing....

My opinion differs from my husband&#39;s who enjoyed it a little more than I did.  We got the house chop suey, egg rolls, pot stickers and shrimp fried rice.  The chop suey and pot stickers were excellent. They provide you the option of fried or streamed pot stickers with isn&#39;t typical of our usual Chinese place.  We opted for the steamed pot stickers and they were perfect. 

 My complaint is with the fried rice and egg rolls.  The rice was bland and the shrimp that came with the rice was undercooked.  Because of this, I ate around the shrimp.  The egg rolls where mildly startling because I bit into it and there was absolutely no color inside the egg roll.  Maybe I&#39;m being fickle, but I&#39;ve had my fair share of egg rolls and I&#39;ve never come across one that had NO color on the inside.

Pros:
-Avalanche roll, shirmp tempura with crunch. 
-Blossoming Flower (the BEST), crab and honey wasabi. 
-Rainbow roll, the old standby. Those are our staple rolls.
-Salmon nigiri is always fresh. 2 pieces per order, so the price is right.
-Eel nigiri is always delicious.
-Warm sake is dangerous...

Cons:
-I only had 1 bad experience with Wangs. Our Blossoming Flower roll had way too much honey wasabi, but we blamed that on the guy distracting the sushi chef while he was making our rolls. That same night I tried a roll that was advertised as being peppered. WAY TOO MUCH PEPPER. It was basically inedible.

Wang&#39;s is a family and office favorite. The lunch specials are delicious, fast and reasonably priced.

wangs-garden-aurora,Jillian K.,Kd0M7iguaOaAflNW5uqvxA,L19UIS1riP77VV-vCldYpw,"I don&#39;t normally write reviews on here but my experience at this restaurant was so horrible that I thought I needed to share. I placed my order for pickup over the phone for 2 entrees, 2 orders of fried rice, and 2 egg rolls. The total came to $40! For Chinese takeout? I almost cancelled my order because of the price but decided to give it a try. After we arrived to pick up our food (my sister was with me), the nice woman at the register began to collect payment and I asked her to go over the order with me again because the price seemed unusually high. I realized that instead of charging me for 2 egg rolls, they charged me for 2 orders of egg rolls (each order comes with 2 so I had 4 in my bag). At this time, another woman came over to assist her. I am not sure if she was the manager or not but she took over for the other woman. I politely told them that I only needed 2 egg rolls so I wanted them to remove one order from my bill. The rude woman began yelling at me in front of everyone and telling me that is not what I ordered on the phone and muttered something in another language to another employee. She tore opened my stapled bag, took the extra egg rolls out, and threw them on the counter. She snatched my credit card from me to adjust the amount. Normally, I would have said something to her about her behavior and left without my food but I was too stunned to say anything. Once we got the food home, it was pretty bland and definitely not worth $40. To make matters worse, my credit card was never credited so they charged me the original amount and the adjusted amount for a total of almost $80. They will definitely be hearing from me and I will never go back to Wang&#39;s Garden. I suggest you avoid this restaurant for their poor customer service and less than average tasting food.",12/05/14,192,1,1,0,-19,-0.8101,1.021,1.213,15.767,No,1816

I haven&#39;t tried their Chinese food yet, but since its right down the street and the sushi specials are a good deal, I decided to give it a try. For $13.99+ tax I got to choose 3 rolls from a limited menu and it came with soup, salad and a fortune cookie. The sushi is decent. Its not on a par with Swordfish or even Raku, but its also significantly cheaper and for the price, the quality is about what I would expect. While I took my food to go, the atmosphere appeared very relaxing and the staff members I dealt with were pleasant and courteous. The place is also very clean which is a must if I&#39;m eating raw fish from an establishment.

For a total of $16.80 which included tax I had a big bowl of hot and sour soup, two wonderful perfectly cooked crab Rangoon&#39;s and a delicious Mongolian beef with steamed rice. My friend had a big bowl of wonton soup with huge wontons (she had to cut to eat,) a hot, perfectly crusty egg roll and General Taos chicken with fried rice and a small side of broccoli. Plus we shared a wonderful pot of hot tea. The food was hot, fresh and tasty!  A perfectly rounded lunch for what you would spend at a fast food restaurant.

wangs-garden-aurora,Dorothy H.,WsvobP1N14FhHph1NwPw8g,UIwPsilHThwmZ18gKLx6CQ,"OK- I don&#39;t normally do reviews. But this place warrants one. My husband and I ate at the restaurant about 3 weeks ago and it was awesome. The diningroom is asian modern with orange walls and very nice tables. We started with some sodas and ordered the fired pot stickers. $4.95 for six! They were perfect as was the dipping sauce. LOVED the fried won ton strips that they give as a free appetizer with sweet and sour and mustard. I could have eaten those chips all night. Fresh- warm and light. Nice touch!

Since it was our first visit I had to check out the hot and sour soup. $2.50 It was very good but could have used more ingredients to make it more substantial. But if you like hot and sour this is not bad.

My husband and I are kung pao chicken freaks. We ordered that and the mongolian beef to mix it up. OMG! the BEST Kung Pao Chicken we have ever had. $ 8.95 The sauce is perfect, hot and nicely spiced- coats the nicely cut up chicken pieces. The carrots, green peppers, water chestnuts, celery and zucchini ( yes- some nice slices) were perfectly diced and complimented the taste profile. with yummy peanuts. The plate presentation was so pretty!!. The mongolian beef $9.75 was fresh with wonderful slices of beef. Perfectly cooked in the sauce with onions and layered on crispy rice noodle. I love this dish and usually get soggy chewy beef elsewhere. Not here. It was excellent quality meat all on a beautiful plate presentation.  Portions were decent size - not huge- but for the quality it is worth it.. Not a big mound of food with lackluster taste. This was seriously great chinese. Both entrees were served with a side of white rice. 

Service was prompt and friendly. We ate almost everything and had no leftovers. But we were so stuffed. You just want to keep putting that wonderful Kung Pao taste in your mouth.. All for under $30 with tip ( they were having a 15% off special for grand opening) but even without that, the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity served.

Tonight we ordered take out Kung Pao Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork.$8.50- ready in 15 minutes on a Saturday night at 7pm.. really? Really. The Kung pao was just a wonderful as our first visit. The sweet and sour pork freaked me out a bit. I opened the container with the fried breaded pork and there were &#34;dozens&#34; of perfectly portioned meat pieces in a light crispy ( tempura like) batter. Wow. Not some, massive big and small globs of meat stuck together like we get at East China inn. Popped one in my mouth and it was wonderful. Pork so tender. It was a pleasure to eat as each piece was a perfect mouthful with the sauce/rice. soaked up the sauce but did not get gummy still crisp and tender! Love the way they cut and fired the pieces of pork!  

Give this place a try- we can&#39;t wait to try some of their other dishes.",09/10/10,345,5,3,5,52,15.8559,11.170000000000003,1.622,34.208,No,2849
wangs-garden-aurora,Tanya S.,XqZZIEEzGkEh56JCp0KCYQ,73UjNbSoQjQAOS45rcihFg,"i went back again. with my mother. this time and for dinner. i tried something other than the pad thai. She had the mu gu beef and i had sesame chicken. We also ordred rainbow rolls.

I thought i would review this restaurant one last time on a day when they weren&#39;t crazy busy because i am sure that 12+ crowd caught them off guard so i didn&#39;t get the quality service i would have gotten had it been a normal day. It was nice and quiet, a little bit less than busy but still enough take out and dine in business. 

Let me say...the rainbow rolls were YUM!!! oh...my...god! WOULD ORDER AGAIN! 

I tried my mom&#39;s Mu Gu pork...just the meat as i don&#39;t like cabbage at all, and it was good!!! My sesame chicken was so yummy! It seemed that the coating was way different than ECI. it semed more light. less heavy. I liked that. The broccoli was cooked just right so it wasn&#39;t too soggy. 

Don&#39;t think when your order arrives, that you have a skimpy portion. 
at first, it looks like you don&#39;t get a lot but i think that is an optical illusion because the plate it is served on is HUGE!! (where as, at East China Inn, the plate is smaller)...so..same amount of food, but you are fooled into thinking it is less because the plate is big! just an FYI. because, i was so full, i took left overs home. 

So, compared to my last visit, i give this place 5 stars now! we went when it was not busy...and we got great service, no mess ups, no slowness. My mom mentioned  at the start of our meal &#34;Can i have a menu to take home?&#34; and the waitress nodded and smiled. When we got our to-go boxes she said...with a genuine smile &#34;And i have included those take home menus for you in with your togo bag!&#34; proving that she did not forget even though we didn&#39;t have to remind her!!

some places, you have to REMIND them of things because they forget. I am definitely going back, next time...for lunch sushi because i am a broke college student who wants to save a few bucks haha.

Visited a couple of times, typically ordering a cold roast beef sandwich with desired fixings, etc. Good sandwich at a fair price - better than the chains; it&#39;s a local family run place.

But what was really great was my most recent experience. I was busy at work and thought it best to order in, so I decided to call BBCD and ask for delivery. I called around 11:30AM, figuring that as long as my meal came before 1PM, I&#39;d be fine with that. So I place my order (which typically includes a pound of potato salad which I spread over a couple of lunches), and am told it will be around 45 minutes...   so 12:15 or so - great!  Well, about 20 minutes or so later, one of the BBCD people is walking into my office with my order.

We ordered:
2 Italian Sub Sandwiches 
1 Classic Cheeseburger and 
1 Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich (I asked if it could be grilled and they let me know that they don&#39;t have any grilled chicken. I guess that should have been a clue right there that they don&#39;t use fresh ingredients in anything that they make.)
I placed my order at 6:30 on a Thursday night (not knowing that they closed at 7:00)
My total was $25 and I was to pick it up in  25 minutes. 
I arrived on time and picked up my food. (I used my $20 voucher that I paid $10 for and then I paid the remaining $5 and change of my bill with cash.)
Review:
On the italian subs, the giardinara was extremely hot.  Even after removing it, there was no way my kids could eat it because the juice from the giardinara was all over the sandwich. Then, I noticed that the meat in the sandwich had started to go bad!
The slices of salami had pink centers with GREY surrounding the edges! 
There was no way I would eat it and I definitely would never feed it to my kids. 
Even if the giardinara had been mild or the meat had been fresh, there&#39;s still no way in hell that I would ever call it an &#34;Italian Submarine&#34;.
 It was not even close. 
They seemed to have used grocery store soft rolls. Reminiscent of a 6pk of &#34;Pepperidge Farm Sub Rolls&#34; or the equivalent. 
How are you going to name your restaurant &#34;Breaking Bread&#34; and not offer amazing bread? 
Moving on. 
The Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich was a gross shade of yellow and was cold. 
The burger was cold also.
I&#39;m not sure how it could have cooled off that much in the less than 5 minute drive to my house. 
Perhaps they didn&#39;t want to make a fresh patty when closing time was so near and so we got one that may have been sitting in a warmer for hours? Who knows. 
We didn&#39;t eat any of our food. 
I called right away and one of the young teenage boys answered the phone. 
I asked to speak to a manager to which he replied that he WAS a manager. 
I explained to him the problems with our order. Starting with the giardinara on the subs.  I didn&#39;t understand why it wouldn&#39;t state that the giardinara was spicy v.s mild on the menu. 
He replied that he didn&#39;t know that there were two different types.
I moved on to my issue with the meat on the subs being grey. 
His answer for was that, &#34;It was probably just the blood settling.&#34; 
What??
 I also told him about the cold food. After rejecting his counter offer of restaurant credit, he agreed to refund my money and took down my info. 
The day I came to collect my refund, the woman at the register was extremely rude to me. 
I explained to her that I had used a Planit Save voucher worth $20 to pay for my $25 tab. 
She looked at me and said, &#34;Yeah, but you aren&#39;t getting a refund for he entire meal, it says here that you complained about the sub sandwich&#34;. 
I explained to her that no, it was the whole order that was unacceptable. 
 I explained the issue with the giardinara on the subs. 
 She said, &#34;That&#39;s not our fault, that&#39;s how you ordered them!&#34;
I explained to her that it usually states on a menu if an item is spicy ....
She scoffed at me. 
I then said, &#34;I wouldn&#39;t have served them to my kids anyways because  the meat on the sandwiches was bad.&#34; 
She rolled her eyes as though I was lying. 
I told her, &#34;The meat on your sub sandwiches was GREY. Not fresh. There&#39;s NO doubt about it, I have pictures.&#34; 
I reached for my phone to unveil the evidence and stated 
&#34;You know, this is completely ridiculous and I cannot believe that this is how you choose to do business.&#34; 
With that, she said, 
&#34;You know what?!...&#34;  and angrily opened the register....
&#34;Here&#39;s your $15!&#34;
It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve had to deal with customer service THAT bad.

I got the ham and salami sandwich and it was warm and delicious. I paired it with the homemade potato chips and dill sauce- also delish. Delivery has been great every time but the food, not so much. Second time, same meal as before, but they gave me a fourth of the amount of dill sauce, which I thought was odd. The sandwich was kinda cold. Third time, a coworker and I got the Mediterranean burgers. Terrible, fake, cold, thin meat. It was 99% bun and 1% meat, which had almost no flavor. The only flavor came from the &#34;garlic mayo&#34; which was tasty, but I didn&#39;t want a bun slathered with mayo, I wanted a hearty burger with mayo to compliment. The potato chips I ordered were soggy, and my co-worker&#39;s fried pickles were tasty but also cold. Another coworker ordered on a different day and said her chicken seemed fake and cold. I understand with delivery food can&#39;t be scalding hot, but it seemed like the food had sat for far too long.

Service: The service was good and the staff was friendly.

Environment: Cute little sandwich shop. Nothing fancy, but clean and comfortable.

Food: Here is where I had a problem. So far I have only tried 2 things on 2 separate occasions so to be fair their other sandwiches could be much better and I picked the 2 that they are not too great at making. 

First Time I went here I tried the Corned Beef sandwich and was rather disappointed. The quality of the meat and bread was good but there was far more bread than meat, and that is not how it should be with a Corned beef. They use very thick cut marble rye and then put the tiniest portion of corned beef between them. Not worth the money I paid for the sandwich. 

Second time I got the Italian Beef with Mozzarella and it was decent, and this time the amount of meat in the sandwich was a fair amount. However I have to say considering Portillo&#39;s is only a 5 minute drive up the road they have some hefty competition when I want an Italian Beef.",17/01/14,123,3,1,2,-9,1.7088,1.709,1.216,9.076999999999998,No,1190
breaking-bread-catering-and-deli-cary,D S.,Kci3DkUggsC2zY1CNEsnvg,ixJcF3qU39HxczSGVONuxQ,"Breaking Bread is a locally owned, family owned sandwich shop in Cary. 

This is a great stop for an afternoon meal that is different from the chain places that surround it.  They offer a wide range of sandwiches, burgers, and dogs as well as soups. 

Their location is not exciting and you can easily drive by without noticing it, however, the interior is welcoming and has a nice vibe.  They really need to add a menu board.  A first timer would be quite confused and may feel awkward upon entering just because you are not sure what to do as evidenced by the stack of discarded, printed menus on the counter during lunch time.  The small printed menus are really the only way to know what to choose from which is odd. 

The food is worth the confusion.  

The sandwiches are made fresh to order and the ingredients are EXCELLENT.  Fresh cut meats, cheeses and veggies.  Awesome Guac!  The BREAD is the money maker:  fresh, warm, and hearty.  I highly suggest getting their &#34;Signature Sandwiches&#34; which are often lightly toasted.  The sandwhich is large and will fill you up.  

Total with chips/drink is around $8-$10 so it is in the Jimmy Johns/Jersey Mikes price range for lunch but this is locally owned, fresh ingredients.

I have throughly enjoyed my meal each time I have eaten here. 

Why not five stars?  Their hours are pretty awful and their menu is impossible to remember and always changing.  Their soups are awesome but not always available.  Weirdness.  

This place is much better than the chains that surround it and I highly encourage you to give it a shot and support a local business!  YUM!",15/08/14,183,4,2,5,11,4.1623,3.7809999999999993,2.1950000000000003,16.024,No,1620

I would only recommend going here if you have an hour+ to eat or 45 minutes or more to wait for your food. I came here for lunch today and it took my grilled cheese 45 minutes to get made, then I didn&#39;t even have time to eat it because I had to take my friend back to school. Honestly took longer than at a nice sit down restaurant when I order steak. Very disappointing experience. I will not be back unless I have a few hours to waste waiting on food I could make myself in 10 minutes.

As for the quality, it was alright. Once I got the sandwich home and ate it, (because I had to drop friend off at school, so I got it to go) it was cold. I did get a hot sandwich. Taste was pretty good, if only it had been hot like it was supposed to be. 

As for price, I would say it is a little over priced for the amount of food you get.

I went with two co-workers who knew of my past experience, the first thing we all did was look at our silverware, all of which was clean. They have new menus that we were able to open - smelled like baby powder so I&#39;m assuming they&#39;re actually wiping them down from time to time. The table was also clean (one seat had what looked like salt on it but that was easily swiped to the floor, no biggie there).
Salsa &amp; chips were decent, chips were fresh although the salsa was not as spicy as we would have liked but still good. Each of us ordered relatively basic things (steak burrito, chicken quesadilla, steak/beef tostadas) and none of us had any complaints - we weren&#39;t raving about it but again, basic orders. The steak actually tasted like steak this time which was a good thing.
The waitress was pleasant - not the most friendly of people in the world but nice and attentive, which is all I ask for. 
The prices didn&#39;t seem outrageous but all of us ordered from the lunch specials, didn&#39;t notice prices outside of what was on that menu. 
So, obviously not the best I&#39;ve had in my life but it wasn&#39;t bad and with it being the closest restaurant there is to the office, I&#39;m sure we will be back again.

I know they are a banquet hall - but I saw them marketed as a Mexican restaurant. Americanized Mexican would be more realistic. I went here to grab a quick bite for lunch because all I wanted was a burrito... and they couldn&#39;t even get that right! They had sauteed red and green peppers as well as sauteed onions in the burrito. Kind of odd texture. I&#39;ve been to a ton of authentic Mexican restaurants and I&#39;ve never had any sauteed veggies put in there, and the onions are always raw. Plus, it was mushy. 

And I was entirely pissed off with the waiter. Must have had selective hearing to just plain didn&#39;t give a shit. When he was asking us what to drink, my friend ordered and I was going to order &#39;a water with lime please&#39;, and before I could even say lime, he scribbled on his pad of paper and walked away. He brought me back water with lemon. I&#39;m not over the top picky when it comes to that kind of stuff, but it ticked me off how he blatantly didn&#39;t even wait for me to finish what I was saying before walking away. I also had to ask for salsa verde about three damn times before I finally got it.

Oh, and the best part. Yes the best part was when I asked for some avocado in my burrito. I got the bill, and they charged me about $3 for it!!! I buy 2 avocados every week and I know they are $1.79 per whole avocado. To be nice, there was about three-quarters of an avocado in the burrito... and they charged me almost the same price of the burrito for some avocado added. When we were paying, I called the waiter over and explained to him that charging me that kind of money for three-quarters of an avocado was ridiculous since they are $1.79 at the store. Normally a waiter would know I am calling bullshit and would offer to take the charge off or at least cut it in half. He didn&#39;t do anything. He blamed the manager and then told me, &#39;Well... we have to go market price. They&#39;re very expensive these days.&#39; And I said, &#39;Bullshit! They&#39;re $1.79! I buy two a week! I know this! And PLUS, I&#39;m not the owner of a restaurant so I do not have the luxury of bartering with local produce outlets. Sheesh!&#39; I paid for the everything as charged and left a 20% tip, but Lord knows you won&#39;t even find my dead body in there, and I will tell the whole world what a f***ing joke your &#39;establishment&#39; is.

This time I happened to come on a Friday for an event (wedding) and the experience turned out to be better than expected. The event offered great dishes with an open bar. The first dish was a salad that didn&#39;t really taste that good because the olives threw it off but that&#39;s just a personal thing. Secondly, the bread on the table looked appetizing but it turned out to be hard and cold! No bread tastes good without it being warm and soft. The dinner plate was great but the only thing that could be improved would have to be the potatoes, flaky and once again, cold. The dessert was tasty and satisfied my sweet tooth. The service was decent but they were pretty busy as I observed.

Not only did he forget about the event we paid for but was very unapologetic. We were supposed to decorate at noon. He didn&#39;t even have the room set up until 1:30, the time the event started. Needless to say we were scrambling to decorate.  He forgot about the event and only had one employee working the tables, which left myself and the other person hosting the event with me grabbing empty pitchers of water, carrying them to the bar, and back to the appropriate tables. This is absolutely unacceptable! His attitude was &#34;well the room was set up by 1:30.&#34; All he cared about was that he got paid. The service we received was not a priority. He wanted to charge extra for another table because he was counting babies as part of the plate count and had the nerve to question the other hostess about it in front of a table full of guests.

The service was perfect, they were so friendly and I felt so welcome and comfortable dining alone. The restaurant was clean and when I left I asked about ordering guacamole and chips to take home. The man asked if I wouldn&#39;t mind waiting a few minutes and whipped me up a huge, fresh batch without peppers because he had asked if I like my guacamole spicy. 

Now I have finally made it home after a very long drive enjoying the very best guacamole I have ever had. I am now spoiled off any other guacamole.

It is small, maybe ten tables and a bar with a few stools. It&#39;s just east of Barrington Road on Hassel, in an older strip mall next to the 7-11. 

We went for an early dinner. When we arrived at around 4:45pm, there were two people at the bar and all of the tables were open. We grabbed seats, wanting to try their Wednesday night $1 taco and $3.99 margarita specials.

On the regular menu, there are a variety of meats to choose from. The $1 taco special is more limited but has enough options to make you happy. 

After reading earlier reviews, we decided to try their guacamole. I must admit, it was probably the best I&#39;ve had. Anywhere. The guac was fresh with just the right amount of tomatoes, jalapenos, cilantro and garlic. There was plenty for the two of us.

I had three tacos - two steak and one chicken. They are served on double corn tortillas with onion and cilantro. ThÌ©y reminded me of great street tacos. My wife had two steak tacos and we split an order of time and beans.

Everything we ate was outstanding. The bartender was generous with the amount of tequila in the margarita, so I only had one. 

But, most of all, the service was fantastic. While we were there, the place started to fill up. But, even when all of the tables were full, he made us feel like we were his only customers.

The prices can&#39;t be beaten. The quality of the food is outrageous and the service is excellent. I think we&#39;ll become regulars on taco night!",03/02/16,184,5,1,5,-13,5.7016,3.493,0.409,20.100000000000005,No,1559

Strange how sometimes the places we visit the most frequently often escape the thought processes for Yelp. Odd. 

Anyway, as you can tell from the vast majority of previous reviews of this little gem tucked away (almost hidden) off of Hassell, people come from all over to get the food here. Here in Hoffman Estates itself, this joint has a damn near cult-like following. They catered a huge party at my apartment complex, the girl I am dating thinks this place is the second coming of Pancho Villa, and their Guac is flat out orgasmic. Does it live up to all this hype? Pretty damn close in my estimation, and this is coming from a guy that adores Mexican food over any other ethnic cuisine out there. 

The restaurant itself is tiny. They have maybe 6 tables, a bar, and a small kitchen. I have always encountered the exact same people every time I have ever visited and they are super friendly. It also gives me the opportunity to work on my rapidly diminishing Spanish language skills. Speaking of which, why the hell do most universities teach Spain Spanish as opposed to the Mexican variety? I think odds are far higher that I will encounter a Mexican in my day to day life in the US than I will find myself sitting in some villa outside of Barcelona, but what do I know? 

I am not going to rehash everything that has been said before about Cantarittos, as the vast majority of what people are Yelping here is 100% accurate. The food is fantastic and about as authentic as you are going to find anywhere I have ever been in Chicago. 

The only reason I rate this place 4 as opposed to 5 stars has to do with a lack of consistency. Sometimes when I show up it&#39;s unbelievable, others it&#39;s just so so. If they could do it up like a rockstar on every visit, they would be firmly sitting undisputed on the top of the food chain and be the gold standard by which all other Mexican places were measured against.",16/07/15,209,4,1,2,3,1.9288000000000003,1.528,1.8400000000000003,15.632000000000001,No,2039

There really aren&#39;t too many GOOD mexican joints in the area... this one gets the job done. I&#39;ve never dined in, but it seems clean and to-the-point.

Clearly, they care about giving quality service grub!

Over the course of a couple of visits, I&#39;ve stuck to really ordering $1 tacos on Wednesdays. You can opt for the lettuce/tomato version, or the more authentic taco with onions and cilantro.  It&#39;s not very filling, and I probably order and extra 1-2 more (less meat and less ingredients overall, say, in comparison to other spots like TBK). 

But I enjoy supporting small businesses, and this one is on point for sure! You won&#39;t find greasy, fatty, poorly cooked anything here. they care.  Extra plus: they once had an elotes cookout during the summer! YUM!

I ordered chicken enchilada and taco combo($6.99)- chicken was dry, rice was dry and pretty tasteless, and I don&#39;t care for the beans.

We also had the ceviche, this was decent but not worth $6.99.

Service was terrible. Took forever to get chips and salsa to the table. The salsa was watered down without any kick at all to it. Chips came out of a bag. 
I ordered the ceviche and it came out reasonably on time and was not bad. 
When I ordered my dinner, Tampiquena Al Asador (marinated skirt steak with an enchilada) I asked the waitress for some fresh jalapeÌ±os and serranos on the side. This was completely foreign to her. She had zero idea what a Serrano was. Not very encouraging for a &#34;Mexican&#34; restaurant! 
When the dinner arrived, as I suspected, there were no jalepenos or serranos. Neither the waitress or the cook had a clue what I was talking about. Finally the cook sliced me some jalepenos - I gave up on the serranos. Good thing I didn&#39;t ask for a habenero! 
The dinner was below average. Steak was over cooked. Enchilada was dry. 
Granted I am from Texas where they do Mexican right. But this place would be out of business in a month ANYWHERE in Texas.

First off, the two stars are for the host/waiter/guy running the place. He was pretty nice and attentive.

We went in on a Wednesday for .99 cent taco night, which was an awesome deal, but I wouldn&#39;t mind paying full price next time. Like other reviews, there isn&#39;t much atmosphere, however it is very intimate; A few seat-yourself tables, a small bar, and a cash register. Where the dining area may lack in decorations, the kitchen, and service more than make up for it. 

The Guacamole: Made fresh. Choice of picco de gallo -- We ordered with the picco de gallo and almost ate the whole bowl before the tacos were ordered; not that service was slow, we just have no self control. Very fresh and delicious. 

The Tacos: Ordered individually, and some ingredients are only available on weekends (the more &#39;exotic&#39; choices). Choice of lettuce and tomato, or onion and cilantro. 
We ordered (with onions and cilantro):
3 Asada (steak):  very tender, and perfect with either salsa--the verde is spicyyy
2 Pastor (pork): also tender, already seasoned so we felt there was no need to use the salsa  
1 Pollo (chicken): I didn&#39;t try this but I heard it was also great especially with salsa

The location of this restaurant isn&#39;t the nicest, but it&#39;s easy to get to and has a lot of parking.  
The inside of the restaurant is small (4-6 tables) and was very stuffy when I went.  There were a few people eating, but otherwise pretty quiet in there.  
I placed my order and got a variety of steak, pork and chicken tacos to go; the $1 price point was nice.  The waitress had a hard time understanding what I wanted.  You get an option of the following toppings for your tacos: cilantro and onion or lettuce and tomato...why not your choice of any 4 of the toppings...?  I opted for lettuce, tomato and cilantro.  The cilantro addition is what threw her off, but she finally got it.  

I didn&#39;t check out the bathroom so I can&#39;t comment on that, but I did see a child playing in the kitchen around the food.  I&#39;m all for family businesses, but there should not be children (frequent germ carriers) playing where food is being prepared.    

The tacos were ready to go in about 10 minutes and came with some red sauce on the side.  

I got home and opened up the foil wrapped tacos and got to work.  I tried some of the red sauce (which is typically good at Mexican restaurants), but was not a fan...way too garlicky and unpleasant.  
The pork taco was the best and had awesome flavor.  The meat was tender and the seasoning was perfect.  
The steak was mediocre and fairly bland with a bit of chewy fat.  The chicken was flavorless.  If I were blindfolded, I wouldn&#39;t have known what I was eating.  The meat looked good though.   
All in all, this place is average at best....even being in Hoffman Estates.  El Famous Burrito has much better tacos as do the places down Irving Park Rd. in nearby Schaumburg.    
I can&#39;t speak to the other menu options, but based on the tacos alone, I&#39;d likely skip this place in the future.",01/09/14,214,2,2,5,21,4.089300000000001,2.5170000000000003,0.523,20.959999999999994,No,1921

The boyfriend and I went with the intent of eating there, but once we saw that it was a pretty small place that had a few patrons already seated, we decided to take it to go. 
My boyfriend had a pork burrito and I had 3 tacos. Everything was fresh and delicious! The tortillas that were used for the tacos are amazing. There was a good portion of meat on each taco (I had one skirt steak, one pork, and one shredded chicken). My boyfriend&#39;s pork burrito was huge! It was really tasty as well, and the sauce on the outside of it was just a tad spicy but nothing too hot.

Our waiter/chef was a sweetheart (I think he had a crush on our co-worker hehe) and was extremely accommodating.  We all ordered lunch combos which were priced very reasonably at $6.99.  I forget the name of my combo..but it came with a cheese enchilada and either a beef or chicken taco; all combos come with beans, rice, and a large soft drink, .  Since my coworkers and I were ravenous and feeling a bit greedy, we were hoping the enchiladas and quesadillas had meat in them (which they didn&#39;t).  So we asked our waiter if we could add meat to certain dishes.  He was so nice and told us sure.  He also let one of us substitute the beef/chicken taco for a pastor taco and did not charge us anymore for the additions/substitutions.  The only reason I deducted one star was due to the long wait for food, the mixup of orders, and our checks.  Since he was our waiter and cook..it took him awhile to cook our 6 dishes and we were there for a long time.

They have so much to offer including an extensive food menu and eclectic atmosphere.

I was overwhelmed with options and a fast moving line when I first entered, so I kind of felt a bit rushed to order. They mean business at 12:30pm and keep the line moving, which is good though. My stomach was telling me to get one of their delicious Philly cheesesteak sandwiches, but my mind said I should probably make a healthier decision so I went with the California wrap. 

In the end my &#34;healthier&#34; choice didn&#39;t really matter, because I chose a side of fries and the wrap was about the size of ginormous burrito. Needless to say, everything was really good! The fries were kind of sweet and salted perfectly. The wrap included fresh ingredients and was super delicious. For like $9 (including a bottle of water), this meal was really two in one. I took home half the wrap and half the fries and enjoyed it the next day for lunch!

Augustino&#39;s looks like a carry-out sandwich spot, but it&#39;s much more than that. They have flatbreads, pastas, and a full deli of goodness. Make your way to the right of the ordering counter and you&#39;ll find a side room with plenty of tables, TVs, and fun rock and roll paraphernalia.

I ordered the Broccoli Cheese soup and Pastrami on Onion roll. The soup was thick and had a very odd flavor. I didn&#39;t like it, so I didn&#39;t eat it. The pastrami was ok, but the onion roll was super dry. 

The boy ordered Chicken Noodle soup and Auggie&#39;s Patty Melt. He said it was a pretty standard soup and he enjoyed it enough to eat it all. The melt was a little greasy. He&#39;s a burger lover, but didn&#39;t rate this one in his top list. It was just ok. The flavor was there and the cheese was melty.

I always see this place when I fill up my gas at the BP station across the street (which has the lowest BP gas prices in the area according to the Gas Buddy App). 

So the first thing I noticed is the fresh meat and cheese they have up front. That is pretty cool.

I love sub sandwiches and Italian has always been my favorite at any sub places. I noticed the person behind me and the two people in front of me ordered the same thing. So it seems like the popular thing to order here.

My sub sandwich was good. Not great, but it was good. I liked how they put a lot of onions in the sandwich. For chips, drink, and sandwich it was almost 10.00. Almost like Quiznos when ordering their Italian (which I think theirs is quite tastier).

Someone said that Portillos is cheaper then this place and I tend to disagree. I think they are about even.

One thing that really bothered me was that is was an older building and it seemed like it was outdated. They had an outside eating patio, but it looked outdated with outgrowing plants (I think the owners like plants because it looked like a jungle out there). Thus I am giving it 4 stars.

Being this was my first time, I read the menu, but the employee who helped me was a bit surly.

I explained it was my first time there and didn&#39;t recall seeing the veggies listed on the menu, nor did I know I had to ask for them specifically, as many places include those staples.

It didn&#39;t seem too busy at 6:30 on a weekday, but took 10+ minutes to get my order. Everything was piping hot, though.

At this point, the prices are at or slightly above a sit down place with a real wait staff, which this place is by no means is.  My girlfriend ordered Italian combo (which she enjoyed, but the taste was about the same as the famous midwest chain, I won&#39;t mention here, but here at a higher price).  At least the size of the combo was descent.  The second red flag was a quarter charge for water... Seriously?!  I get it, plastic cups cost money, but at your prices you can&#39;t give someone a free cup of water?!

Now to the food.  I must say I was not impressed with my ruben, it was not anything special.  Homemade chips tasted just like any other homemade chips I has ever had.  The food was not anything spectacular, about average.

Let me mention the service...  As it&#39;s a big part of restaurant experience.  The cashier, that took our order, was perky and nice, the guy who brought it out to us, had this look on his face, which almost made me asking him, &#34;blink twice if you are here against your will...&#34;  But yet when one of his friends showed up, he was all Mr. Social.  Look, I worked in a grocery store when I was in high school, you better believe it, if I was not giving customers anything other than 100%, my manager would have ripped me a new one (and yes, I am not that old, it was in late 90s, when I worked at the grocery store in high school).

Overall, it&#39;s not worth the money.  Sorry to say it&#39;s an overpriced joint.  For what we got, we could have eaten the same thing at a sit down place for less.

Price wise, food taste and service is a C-.  Barely above D, friendliness of the cashier gets that slight notch.",13/08/16,249,3,2,2,31,1.115,1.1520000000000001,1.1880000000000002,19.661,No,2094

My daughter loves it and it&#39;s probably one of her favorite restaurants because of the italian ice and the decor.  She doesn&#39;t actually really eat the food from here, maybe an occassional nibble on a burger, but she always demands we go if we are passing by.
The ordering system is a little wonky at times because people are slower and then you have to awkwardly pass them so you can pay.  I&#39;m not sure how it could be done better, but when it&#39;s packed it&#39;s a big pain.
Other than that it&#39;s a pretty standard restaurant.  The Italian beef is delicious and so far I haven&#39;t had anything I didn&#39;t like.  The house made chips are also yum.
The kids meals are nice for the kids because it includes a drink and the Italian ice.  Parking can be a little bit crazy because the lot opens into Schmale as well as St Charles.",27/09/16,88,4,1,2,-4,1.6697000000000002,1.722,0.6729999999999999,7.604,No,902

DÌ©cor: This being my first visit to an Augustino&#39;s I had no real idea what to expect... and boy was I surprised haha. They have kind of a cheesy rock &#39;n roll, 1950&#39;s motif going on but inside and outside. It&#39;s a bit more strange that than, however, because it isn&#39;t trying to be &#34;authentic&#34; or period-correct, it&#39;s trying to be cheesy. There is a bunch of stuff on the walls and such and a giant guitar in a glass case and the dining room has a Marilyn Monroe statue in the middle... it&#39;s pretty bizarre... but ultimately &#34;fun&#34;, I guess. Anyway, everything was well taken care of and clean, so I certainly cannot complain.
Bathroom: decently well looked after, clean, and well lit

Staff: The sandwich guy and cashiers were both friendly and patient (I ordered my sandwich ass-backwards) and the &#34;bus boy&#34; (kid sweeping the floors) was also nice.

Food: We had a Turkey Burger (BIG burger, very tasty) with cheese fries (dynamite cheese and fries) and an Italian Sub (HUGE and quite enjoyable) with homemade chips (enjoyable). The food was delivered to our table rather quickly and tasted just fine. The portions are pretty sizeable as well.

Value: Given the portion sizes I&#39;d say you leave here ahead given the prices.

I&#39;m a sucker for italian beefs and when I&#39;m home and craving it, I end up going to this place. The first time I wanted an Italian beef, I mistakenly said Italian beef sandwich and gotten a cold cut instead (it was busy during lunch hour and I never bothered to check my order) 

Next time, I specifically asked for the Italian Beef -- and it was alright. Just the sandwich could be a bit dry. What turned me off is that cheese and hot peppers are extra and I asked for it in all my sandwiches -- coming home and opening them, it turned out only one of the 3 had both. One was missing it all and one had only cheese. 
For a 5&#34; sandwich that ran me over $6, I expect it to be a bit better. I think I&#39;m gonna get my next fix of italian beef from portillos from now on :)

Anyways, my initial feeling towards this place is and has been &#39;eh.&#39; Everyone else raves about how good the sandwiches are, but I just really had never been a fan. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m not a big sandwich guy in the first place. 

When I ordered this time, I used the custom deli. I did not make the mistake of ordering their gluten free bread (3.00 extra charge), so that was a plus. I ordered the oven roasted turkey breast with lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle. NO MAYO! 

My order was correct, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much better the sandwich was than the last time I went to Augie&#39;s. I was put off by the long wait as well as the 14 dollars that I paid. This trip, I only paid 6 dollars for a substanially sized sandwich (It was sliced Rye; no roll).

I&#39;m glad I gave &#39;Augie&#39;s&#39; another try; Everyone else swears by it, and I guess if I ordered some of their more famous subs maybe I would too. I would defintely take this over Subway (funny since 2012 how Subway has gone down in quality and up in price). I will definitely be back, just not during the lunch rush hour!",21/03/14,182,4,1,3,-35,2.7848999999999995,1.582,0.983,14.434999999999999,No,1546

I went back to augustinos (around 8 pm) and I see the manager and about 5 other employees standing around talking and laughing. So they have time to talk but can&#39;t go through their dairy products to make sure people (especially kids) don&#39;t consume spoiled milk?? Real nice.

augustinos-rock-and-roll-deli-carol-stream,Janni V.,GKZw9pVMesGBRfCR7Q_bgw,Iz6XcJXO8kyIgfadUEzcNA,"I must have gone past this place a bazillion times. From the outside, that kitschy &#39;50s American diner vibe just doesn&#39;t do it for me. I mean, I&#39;ll deal with it at Portillo&#39;s, but it&#39;s not as overwhelming as it is here. 

Enter Yelp, which has some fantastic reviews of this place, as well as elaborating on their menu. While it may look like a &#39;50s diner, it&#39;s actually a rather fantastic deli. They have burgers, fries, patty melts, hot dogs, Italian beef, and Italian sausage. But they also have great deli sandwiches, house-made salads, marinated olives, marinated mushrooms (you want some of these, trust me), and several flavors of Italian ice.

Not only that, I have to acknowledge the fact that they do something pretty unheard-of for most places like this out here: their water/soda cups, plates, to-go boxes, and all the other accoutrements of your typical fast dining experience (particularly if it&#39;s carry out) are all eco-friendly. No more being awash in a sea of #6 styrofoam that you can only recycle if you take it to the Dart facility in North Aurora! COMPOSTABLE TO-GO CONTAINERS. Sure, I&#39;ve seen them before, but usually only at places like Blind Faith or the Whole Foods cafeteria. This is a normal (but awesome), unpretentious deli -- and they care about the environment, too. And they&#39;re open late -- you can have a deli sammich for dinner, not just lunch! SCORE. 

I am so very down with that. We ate in, and ordered a chicken parmesan sandwich and an Italian oven grinder. The oven grinder was listed as being a two-handed sandwich -- which it is. I had to take half of it home to eat for lunch the next day, in fact. The marinated peppers and the special oil and vinegar sauce they put on this sandwich are magical, and perfectly balanced. The French bread is the perfect toasted, crunchy texture, as well. 

The marinated mushrooms are also fantastic. Just a little garlic, with a fantastic balance of olive oil, vinegar, and herbs. The marinara on the chicken parm is beautifully seasoned, and the whole sandwich is fantastic. My SO ordered that, so I only had a couple of bites, but I will definitely order myself one in the future.

Prices are super reasonable. My Italian oven grinder was just under $6 and I&#39;m getting two meals out of it. Score again. 

If you ask for a cup of water, they will charge you $.25...but since they&#39;re using the eco-friendly cups (and I know those aren&#39;t cheap), I&#39;m totally fine with it. That&#39;s less than a postage stamp costs. I am happy to spend a quarter to support an awesome eating establishment&#39;s choice to use less non-biodegradable crap in their daily business. 

Woot woot! We will definitely be back for more. Can&#39;t wait to try their reuben and their Italian ices! :9",20/09/13,320,4,3,5,51,10.543199999999999,5.768,0.308,27.924,No,2806

I rarely eat inside, so the 1950s decor isn&#39;t the draw for me at all, it&#39;s the sandwiches themselves. They pile the meat on nice and high, which is probably the biggest selling point. The bread they use for the buns is great, and they top the sandwiches well, but the quality of the meat itself is what makes the sandwich so good. They have a nice variety reminiscent of an old school deli, but in my opinion they undersell that. Not sure why.

Immediately recognizable with its jukebox themed exterior from the outside, Augustino&#39;s has a wide and diverse menu of items to try. Over the years I&#39;ve been to Augustino&#39;s a few times, and I pass the place nearly every day. You might be wondering, &#34;Why did it take you so long to review it&#34;. Well, it&#39;s never been a place I&#39;ve been super fond of, at least not enough to go out of my way to visit on anything resembling a regular basis. The other reason is quite frankly I was unaware they had hot dogs. Yes, the &#34;frankly&#34; was a pun, and a terrible one at that.

In walking into Augustino&#39;s there&#39;s a large counter with a menu board above you and a lot of food preparation stations. Someone comes over to face you and asks what you&#39;d like to order. The hot dog served by Augustino&#39;s is called the Aug Dog, and I decided to give it a try. I paid at the counter and took a seat in the 1950s themed dining area. 

What&#39;s interesting about Augustino&#39;s Rock and Roll deli is that it&#39;s really more of a 50s themed restaurant than Rock N Roll themed. Objects that I spotted not quite fitting the Rock and Roll theme were a statue of Betty Boop, Marilyn Monroe and some Rock em Sockem robots. Shortly after looking around my food was ready and I prepared to dig in and try the Aug Dog.

This hot dog came on a regular non-poppy seed bun. There were two long but well placed tomato slices on the hot dog so that tomato could be tasted in every bite. There was a thin pickle spear placed in the center of the dog. The application of mustard, onion and relish was excellent, and there were a couple of hot peppers applied to the dog but not in such a manner that you could consistently taste hot pepper flavor without reconfiguring the placement of these toppings. The sausage itself was skinless and appeared to be Vienna Beef or Red Hot Chicago.

 I took my first bite into the dog and was surprised by the outcome. This was an excellent hot dog. The condiments were well applied outside of the peppers, the bun was soft enough. I wouldn&#39;t quite say it was a five star hot dog, but I would definitely stop and try the Aug Dog again. Four stars.",10/10/12,263,4,1,4,2,3.7408,1.996,0.503,21.502000000000002,No,2306

Compared  to the one on North Ave, this place is pretty small. The ordering process is kind of awkward too. You basically wait for your guy to make you the sandwich for you so you can pick it up and bring it to the cash register. I stood in the line and watched a few people walk ahead of me to the next guy that was open. 

I ordered:

Augies Italian Sub (6 inch) (Around 5 bucks): There are pros and cons to this sandwich, the bread is fantastic and chewy, its packed with different kinds of meat and the tomatoes,  onions, and lettuce tasted pretty fresh. Cheese was fine too. The problem I had is the house dressing, I normally expect italian subs to have some sort of tangy semi sweet zingy dressing. This dressing was just sort of salty which didn&#39;t go well with the salty meats and cheese already in the sandwich. In the end it still tasted fine. 

Chicken Noodle Soup: (2 dollars for a small): Had some sort of long wide home made fettuccine style noodle in it which tasted good. The soup itself was pretty generic and the chicken and vegetables were kind of lacking.

I still eat here but I would prefer that human fingers don&#39;t touch my food.,13/04/15,31,4,1,0,-6,-0.22399999999999998,0.17,0.381,4.45,No,304
augustinos-rock-and-roll-deli-carol-stream,Amanda Y.,KJ8mw5k3Jw9LXwujctJhGQ,AOdtISZqpK4woi1noOkwPQ,"We love Augie&#39;s and have been going there for years. We have eaten in in the past, but pretty much exclusively call ahead and pick up now. They open rather early, even on the weekends, so you can call ahead and pick up a sandwich for lunch before work! When I&#39;ve had to do it early on a weekend, they&#39;ve asked me when I&#39;d like it ready, not just telling me a time, which I liked. Any other &#34;off&#34; time that I&#39;ve called ahead, I think they&#39;ve usually said 10-15 minutes, which leaves me just enough time to get off the phone and drive there. At dinner time I think they&#39;ve still only said 15-20 minutes, which isn&#39;t bad at all for being busy. And since just picking up at the counter, even if it is busy with the dinner rush, you don&#39;t have to deal with the line that others have mentioned. Quality is consistent, food is good, not crazy expensive. Honestly, we probably should expand our horizons a bit more with all their options on the menu, but we usually stick to the tried and true. My go to is usually the Italian sub, others in my family go for the American. Can never go wrong with cheese fries or breaded mushrooms. My husband loves the three bean/mixed bean (not sure official name) salad, he&#39;ll eat as much as I bring home. The last time we went, he thought he&#39;d try the sausage sandwich. (Based on the menu saying &#34;two hands&#34;, I think maybe it was the Maxwell and not Italian? But I can&#39;t recall at the moment.) Whatever it was, it was huge! At least a foot if not a few inches longer. But he was pleased with it. And that one they actually waited to assemble until I was actually there to pick it up. You know it&#39;s fresh when you see them do it! I think the only thing we&#39;ve gotten there that we haven&#39;t really enjoyed was the ravioli - then again it was for lunch the next day, so reheated which could change it a bit. But hey, everything else is good, and it&#39;s a deli anyway! Really no complaints here. Will continue to go back, and maybe even try something new!",05/11/15,235,5,1,5,-24,5.8084,3.4060000000000006,0.821,19.773000000000003,No,2056
augustinos-rock-and-roll-deli-carol-stream,Robert G.,5Lwp4dv_yxLYoh9zihelWA,uucXqHanb7lwbr5IQ1WHSA,"Some years ago, when the Garibaldi&#39;s in Bloomingdale closed, I figured that would be the last I would see of decent mushroom and melted cheese roast beef subs. I was wrong.

My wife and I went to Augustino&#39;s for a late dinner... sometime around 8:30pm. She got a chicken sandwich and fries, while I got a roast beef sandwich with grilled onions and mushrooms, and a seasoned cheese sauce.

On the side, I had sweet potato fries. Maybe these don&#39;t meet some people&#39;s definition of &#34;real fries&#34;, but I don&#39;t care - they were crispy and needed only a little salt to reach perfection.

Now, the sandwich itself: The beef isn&#39;t thin and trending towards flavorless like Garibaldi&#39;s used to be (I only got it for the mushrooms!). Instead, the meat was sliced thick, and the marinade used for the meat was very good. The bread was lightly toasted; more importantly, it had flavor. The cheese sauce was thick, but not solid, and definitely had a little bit of kick to it. Fantastic.

My wife&#39;s chicken sandwich was thick, but still juicy all the way through - this is such a rare thing for white meat chicken sandwiches that I wonder if they brine the chicken before cooking. It came with a honey-mustard sauce that was strong on the mustard, and gave the sandwich (and fries) a nice, hot kick. Normally I&#39;m not a fan of hot mustards, so I was pleasantly surprised to be liking this sauce.

Next time, I&#39;ll try the cold cuts to see if they stack up as well.",27/08/10,177,5,1,4,-7,3.0565,2.75,1.3570000000000002,10.891,No,1497

Not too long ago they had a po boy style wrap with breaded shrimp.  YUM.  It was the best po boy style sandwich I have had since I left New Orleans.

Ordered a soup and a chicken parmesan sandwich.  Broccoli cheddar soup was watery and had to have salt added to it to give it some semblance of flavor.  And chicken parm&#39;s usually pretty straightforward and hard to screw up, right?  Well, more flavorless-ness.  Bread was a tad above average, sauce might as well come from a can from Jewel, and I&#39;ve had a better chicken patty on an airline.  Not to mention the presentation was just a sloppy mess.

As much as I love local sandwich places, especially places like this with a fantastic history in the community and decor that keeps me looking around, Augustino&#39;s under-delivered.

Subs for everyone, tell them how you want it! They also have soup, pasta, burgers, wraps, salads, hot sandwiches . . . what more could you want? Many of the plates come with huge helpings of fries that you can share. Even the kid&#39;s menu items are fairly large. My little brother can&#39;t get enough of the mac n&#39;cheese, or the oreos on the side. I myself have tried a multitude of menu items, but my preferred dish will always be the turkey-bacon-club. It&#39;s big, tasty, and good-looking. If you&#39;ve got a sweet tooth but are looking for a healthier alternative to ice cream, try the Italian ice--and try several flavors! I like a mix of mango and strawberry, but they&#39;ve always got several choices. 

The best part about Augie&#39;s is the service. They are fast, always smiling, and super friendly. My family and I are regulars, so the owner always comes out to say hello. He even knows that my brother is picky and likes his chicken sandwich in a special way that differs from any other item on the menu, and we&#39;ve never had a problem getting it done that way.

I thought the service was great, the guys who took our order could have been a little friendlier but I thought it added to the atmosphere. The ladies behind the register were a delight though, very helpful with a couple questions we had and just overall very kind. They even addressed people by sir and ma&#39;am... I like that.

My friend and I got the meatball sub and a turkey sandwich to share. Meatball sub was very good (I&#39;d ask for a little extra drizzle of marinara sauce) but the turkey was not very good at all. Because of the other great reviews I&#39;m going to let this one slide but the bread was that chewy should have been warmed or something kind of bread that makes you just want to eat the inside of the sandwich instead of suffer through the bite and tear motion over and over again. 

Couple more things:
Everything costs extra so if you don&#39;t want something on your sub when they ask you are saving yourself some $ (I just kept saying &#34;yeah sure&#34; because I didn&#39;t know)

Don&#39;t get your food &#34;to go&#34; if yo have never been here. I really loved the old-school art and even if you are eating by yourself there is at least ten minutes of looking around you could do before you get bored.

For the BBQ, you can pick different types of meat (minimum of 2 servings) or you can go with one of the 3 combos that are for 3+ people for $68.  Each combo comes with 4 different types of meats.  The galbi and bulgogi are always a favorite.

Other things on the menu includes bibimbap $10 (signature Korean rice bowl served with vegetables, beef and fried egg), all sort of stews $10 - $14 (spicy fish roe is one of my favorites), stir-fry, and noodle soups $10.  Their Bokpunja black raspberry wine was delicious!",08/08/16,128,5,2,5,50,4.5751,2.781,0.0,9.219,No,1046

It was our first time here and the service was excellent. The waiter explained the menu to us. She asked if we wanted to do the BBQ or the regular menu with food from the kitchen and we chose the Korean BBQ of course! 

They offered 3 different combos, which each have 4 different meats. We chose Combo B, which had pork belly, galbi, brisket, and sirloin steak. The combos are $68 but it&#39;s worth it for the quality and flavor of the meat. It also comes with miso soup and rice so this is the best deal. Otherwise, you can order the meats individually but it&#39;s more expensive this way, with each meat averaging in the $20 range. I would&#39;ve given 5 stars but I just wish this place was unlimited all you can eat KBBQ but it was definitely top quality meat, worth the expensive price tag.

I also loved that each of the servers would come by and ask if we needed anything and they would cook the meat for you unlike at other KBBQ places. It&#39;s nice because you can just relax and eat while they cook the food in front of you!

This place has become one of my top KBBQ restaurants. I do have to say that it is pricy for 2 people, the Combo was $68 plus $8 tax to the bill plus tip. We paid around $90 total and for that price, I wish it was unlimited KBBQ. However, the excellent service and quality of the meat makes it worth the price.

I&#39;m not greatly impressed, but I&#39;m not exactly  disappointed either. Somewhere sort of in the middle, I suppose, is the most apt way to put it. The meat servings were sweet and juicy, but small (AND EXPENSIVE, but we&#39;ll address that later). Rice bowl portions were also initially small (seriously).
The side dishes (banchan) were good, however. The kimchee is a little more on the fresh side (not as fermented) with a good spicy kick, the vegetables and herbs were well-seasoned, and this is one of the few places that has macaroni salad (which is always good in my book).

So the BBQ was just mediocre, but the soup was incredibly bland and the codfish casserole was really not very meaty at all and I just got a lot of the fat. Granted, the fat is part of the fish, it just seemed a little excessive. The soup was somewhat spicy but almost flavorless, and there weren&#39;t as many vegetables as I would have thought. It was just missing some of the essence of what makes this particular soup special.

SERVICE *Note, I suspect they were short on servers this day
The meat was cut initially by Friendly Sam L (who may be a manager there, according to Yelp. Seems like a nice guy). But he didn&#39;t exactly cut all of the meat that we ordered, so after placing what was cut on the grill, he dropped the tools into the meat dish and ran off (in his defense, it was sort of busy). However, the meat on the grill was gone within minutes and we were left feeling ignored. Not a major complaint, but don&#39;t expect the servers to cut and grill the meat for you (as some of the reviewers have had). Here is where the problems REALLY began:

1. When we were seated, the banchan came out, but instead of the server placing the banchan on the table, she handed the tray over and we had to unload the banchan ourselves. My wife was rather taken aback but the serving lady offered no excuses. There was nobody at the table next to us so it&#39;s not that she was physically unable to walk around and place the banchan on the table. Rather, she just couldn&#39;t be bothered with it. At any other Korean restaurant, this is unheard of.

2. After Sam cut up some of the meat, he got called by a table and ran off, but dropped the tongs and scissors INTO the meat and juices, handles and all. We noticed this and did not want to touch the tools which were now swimming in the meat juices. I&#39;m not sure but last I checked, that could be a health code violation, especially since he was handling the tools with his bare hands. We didn&#39;t want to touch the tools, but the next lady who came to cut up the meat (not grill, just cut) ignored our observations with some hasty excuse and just cut using the same, wet tools.

3. When you have at least 3 grown men at the table, it&#39;s a good idea to keep an eye out to see if there&#39;s anything that needs to be refilled. Nothing got refilled until much later and we were left sitting, feeling rather ignored.

4. I counted exactly once, that we were checked up on. Once.

5. I emptied my water cup, as did some of the others at our table. Only one cup was refilled. Once.

6. We asked for rice and soup, which, for those who don&#39;t know, at a Korean BBQ restaurant, those are the most basic dishes that are ALWAYS ready to go. Those took about 15-20 minutes to arrive, and they were not well filled-out (the soup had a few vegetables floating around in it, but that was it), and the rice bowl was seriously 1/2 filled and fluffed (not packed). 

PRICE
EXPENSIVE. It costs $29 per order of gal-bi and we had to order 4 servings to feed 6 adults (it still was nowhere near enough). The A combination was $67, and while it would have been a little less food (but 4 different kinds of meat), the amount of gal-bi per serving that we got instead was absolutely not worth $29 per serving.

We also ordered a codfish casserole as well to go along, which is extraordinarily expensive for what it is. 2 clams and 1 piece of fish for this price?

We were also going to order the spicy stir-fried rice cakes, but $14 is...criminal...for what it is. Most places will serve the same plate for about $9.99, which while still a little pricey, is a better deal than what they have here. Although I admit we didn&#39;t order it, for $14, this dish ought to be massive since rice cakes are seriously nothing but densely-packed belly-filling carbs and it&#39;s dirt cheap to boot.

AMBIANCE
Clean(er), but noisy and crowded. Very oddly, there are marathon medals and pictures near the door, but I don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re there. Is this marathon food? Should we be motivated to run? Unless they&#39;re awards or restaurant reviews, I don&#39;t understand the point. Just sort of strange.

FINAL THOUGHT
Despite my complaints, it&#39;s really not a bad place. The meat is pretty tasty and service (can be) pretty friendly. I just wish (as I imagine others might too) it was a little more reasonably priced and the portions were a little...bigger. I will say, however, this place does have some potential. Guess we&#39;ll se",14/08/16,584,2,1,4,-54,3.2455000000000003,4.760999999999999,2.6550000000000002,44.585,No,5079

I think I like this place better than Koreana also because the interior is a lot cleaner and more ventilated- a necessity if you don&#39;t want to leave smelling like Korean bbq. The service was pretty slow, however, and Korean restaurants are usually known for their no-frills faster service. So that was a disappointment.

I ordered the dolsot bibimbap with beef. It was a deliciously huge portion in a nice sizzling stone pot. I loved the array of tasty seasonings and veggies in this dish. The banchan (side dishes) are also pretty good here- awesome picks including Kim chi, radish Kim chi, seasoned cucumber, fish cakes, beans, pasta salad, and more. 

Always a very filling meal when you go to a Korean restaurant, and I was definitely way too full after this meal. Better that than still needing more food though! Overall a satisfying experience.",12/08/16,113,3,2,5,31,4.8158,2.869,0.5790000000000001,7.5520000000000005,No,917

The Galbi-jiim is not on the menu, but there&#39;s a photo of it hanging up. It was delicious and enough for left overs. It does take a little extra cooking time to tenderize the meat so be patient, and I appreciated the server letting me know that. The only complaint I have is that sometimes it takes a while to get seated, but I assume they are just busy.

We also got haemul pacheon (seafood pancake)-- it was okay! I feel like it could&#39;ve benefited for a little bit longer in the pan to get more crisp. They had a great selection of banchan though. Great kimchi. The complementary soup was really good.

5 stars for the quality of the meats and the banchan.  I&#39;ve been to a few places where the meat came out all frozen and stuck to each other or thawed out with a pool of blood on the bottom. Yeah, I know.  Yuck!  But you won&#39;t find anything like that here because everything including the banchan here tastes fresh.  The pickled cucumbers and kimchee radishes were still crunchy and the pieces of stir fry fish cake were my favorite! My date and I ordered the Combo B ( galbi, bulgogi, brisket and pork belly) and even though it was meant for 3 people, we ate every piece that was left with no trouble.  I&#39;m not saying the portions are small here, but if you&#39;re coming here with more than one serious eater than you might want to order one or the sides or soups.  It is pricey here but the quality was really good so it&#39;s justified in my book.  However, just keep in mind that some of their casseroles and higher quality meats are around $30 bucks on their own so unless you&#39;re rolling in dough, the combo may be the way to go.  (Rhymes are fun!)  

The service was very attentive with several of the different wait staff walking around every few minutes to check up on your cooking skills.  I will say that our waiter asked if we would like to cook our own meats, which we said yes because we wanted to enjoy our dinner slowly and cook a little bit at a time.  But when he saw that we weren&#39;t cooking the pork belly to his liking, he asked to see the tongs and took over.  He then placed the rest of the pork on the grill at once.  When all of the pork belly was done cooking, he then placed all of the bulgogi on the grill and so on until he finished cooking for us in just a few minutes.  I know he was just helping out, but we were really looking forward to a slower meal on our own but had to eat quicker before the meat cooled down.

When they first opened, I would have given them a 5 star for a suburban Korean restaurant. However, their food quality certainly has gone down. I ordered the goat stew and they didn&#39;t season the soup properly, nor did it seem like they used a broth. It tasted like the just used water. Their side dishes are still pretty good. Their menu was also designed pretty nicely. It caters to the non-Korean demographic in that there are pictures, and a better description than most places. Going back to the entrees, it seems like they are cutting too many corners to help with their food cost.

The owner&#39;s son, Sam, was personable and created an experience that makes me wish I lived in the Chicago area.

I live in Southern California and have been to 7-10 Korean BBQ&#39;s and have yet to experience a place like 92 Town.

He told/showed us how and who pours the alcohol, how to cheers in Korean and the order of drinking.  

The quality of meat was also great.  At AYCE places they are typically hit or miss, but 92 Town values quality, which is why they are NOT AYCE.  The difference in taste definitely makes up for the higher price.

We got the menu immediately to look over the food.  This restaurant has tables, and bbq table booths.  Depending on what you want, would be where you were seated.

I was having a taste for bibimbap.  This is definitely not the right place to eat that, however they do have it on their menu.  They don&#39;t use the clay pot, but serve it in a metal bowl instead.  Overall the food was still very good.  Love the sauce.

The price for their menu is reasonable.  Bibimbap was under $10.  My husband ordered a bulgogi noodle soup, for him and the baby.  It was the next thing, that was not too spicy.  I don&#39;t recall how many banchan dishes were offered, but it was 4 to 6 of them.  Good variety.  Potato salad, pickled peppers, bean sprouts, kimchee, etc.

Overall, on weekends this place gets quite busy.  The workers here focus more on the bbq table booths..  If you are not bbq-ing, they will mainly forget about you.  Food will take longer to get to you.  Our glasses were not re-filled. Myy husband finished his rice bowl pretty quick.  We did not get a re-fill.  We sat at our table for over 15 minutes, before someone finally came over to pack up our leftovers and get us a check.

We&#39;ve also had other dishes here before.  Their food and flavors are pretty good.  
Would recommend this place, and we probably will go back here.",07/06/16,196,3,1,4,5,3.9051,3.691,0.4,26.909000000000002,No,1708

This Korean BBQ place is open late, which definitely gives them a one up on other restaurants that close at 9 or 10. The service is outstanding, everyone is so friendly and SJ - our waiter was super friendly and gave us some suggestions on what to order. You definitely don&#39;t see this kind of customer service everywhere. He told us a lot about himself, and also learned some Laotian words from us which was super cool. 

Aside from the outstanding service, the food was so delicious. He recommended the Buckwheat spicy noodle - which was DELICIOUS, and I dipped our meat in the leftover sauce because it was soooooooo good. 

I would definitely recommend this if you like Korean BBQ, good service and great food. If you come during a busy time/ weekend, I&#39;d make reservations as they get super busy...

On a recent foray out to the &#39;burbs we decided to take a leap of faith and tried 92 Town Korean BBQ.  Boy, did our little leap pay dividends.  We ordered 2 orders of the BBQ meat (Wang Kalbi and Seng Kalbi) the Bibim Neang Min (cold spicy noodles), and Chap Chae, and we systematically demolished all of it (2 adults of normal size and one 3 year old of normal size) .  The quality of the meat exceeded all my expectations and rivals the quality that we get at the top-notch places in LA (e.g., Chosun).  I think the biggest testament to 92 Town is that my 3 year old string bean daughter probably ate one whole order of the kalbi by herself.  

Beyond the superlative food, it&#39;s really awesome to have authentic Korean food without a side of the surly service (yeah, I&#39;m looking at you overworked and possibly underpaid San Soo Gab San ladies).

This time I came for dinner and brought my boyfriend with me. We were given a table quickly and ordered the Gyoza as appetizer and the galbi and bulgogi for our entree. There was some confusion as the waitress asked us if they could cook our bulgogi and we asked to cook it on our table. But that miscommunication led to having both galbi (B1) and bulgogi (B13) being cooked in their kitchen. Both meats came out nice and hot and cooked to perfection so we were okay with it. I liked their soybean paste soup that came with our meals. The service was good (better than the last time I came) despite the restaurant being busy at 7pm. The food was also good and had no complaints there. The restaurant even gave me a cute little coin purse as they were celebrating their 3 year anniversary.

The service is convenient as there is a bell right next to the table that notifies the server if you need extra water, or banchan (Korean side dishes that come free with the meal), napkins, etc.

Wanted to go somewhere new and saw nothing but good reviews for this place. Like others have said, the meat is top notch and priced fairly. We were pretty nervous about grilling correctly, but thankfully the owner mans that for you. The owner is a young guy with impeccable customer service and a great personality. He also cares a great deal about the restaurant and his folks who help run it, so you know you&#39;re getting quality food. 

We ordered the awesome rice pancakes, dak bulgogi, and Sam gyup sal. They also provide nice fresh lettuce so you can make Bossam. Banchan is very yummy too. Especially loved their in house kimchi, pickled radish, fishcake (surprisingly), and SO enjoyed the pasta salad and all the non fermented stuff. 

Due to the richness of the meat, got a minor tummy ache and ordered a Sprite for us, owner was nice and gave it to us on the house. 

TL;DR: Owner is awesome, food is fantastic.

As soon as we ordered, the meats and banchan came out, and our excellent and friendly service began - and never stopped til we walked out the door!

We ordered the Sliced Rib Eye + Wine Pork Belly.

The pork belly was first, and the waiter advised us to cook kimchi on the edges to soak up the pork fat as the belly cooked. This resulted in one of the best-tasting bites I&#39;ve had in a long time. Kimchi itself is already something that I love, but the pork fat enhanced the flavor to a level I&#39;ve never had before! The pork belly itself was on the fattier side, but the meat was very flavorful.

The Ribeye was unseasoned, well marbled and tender and delicious!

Banchans were good too - great flavor and all very complimentary to the proteins we selected. The kimchi was some of the best I&#39;ve tasted in a while. The soybean paste was good.

Both my husband and I could understand it was not his fault. He suggested an appetizer that was a veggie rice crepe style dish... It was very good. For dinner we ordered the Garlic Pork Belly &amp; Rib Eye. They bring the pan and burner right to the table... The smell is incredible. The salad they give you is delicious, I could not tell you what all of the side dishes were. We are adventures eaters so we tried them all.

We were pleasantly surprised that they were open so late. We were looking to grab a bite past 9PM so there weren&#39;t too many options.

I ordered the galbitang (beef stew) and my fiance got the soontofu (spicy tofu soup). The portion sizes for both were huge and they also gave us 8 banchans (side dishes).

We stopped by on Memorial weekend.  Ordered a handful of dishes.  My favourite is their Galbi-jjim and Bossam. Short ribs in Gabli-jjim are very tender and succulent, and the sauce is irresistible! I definitely recommend to try Galbi-jjim for at least once.

Also Bossam here distinguishes from other places. Usually the bossam I know comes in one big plate with all side dishes together but this place has its own unique style. The pork belly comes in a pot and side dishes come separately so that the meat keeps itself warm while you eat. The pork belly is very tender and juicy with this good herb flavor. The lady working there was nice and friendly and she was very kind to bring more banchan (korean side dishes) when we asked.

I would say 5 stars for the taste and service (a few times, when not busy, the lady I assume was the owner would actually cook our dishes for us) but the price is a little bit high.

Fairly decent size helping with seafood for a good price at 9.99 - we&#39;ve been to places where it was double for the same amount, so huge plus there.  The only complaint on his end was that the egg was overcooked - other places wait until they serve the soup to you and crack the egg open then and there so that it&#39;s still leaky.

I ordered the dolsat-bibimbap.  Great flavor, huge helping, especially since it comes with a small soy bean soup.  Egg was overcooked too, but to be fair, I waiting a little too long before mixing up the rice and vegetables - rice stuck to the bowl and burnt =(.  When you first get the bowl, you&#39;ll hear everything sizzling.  If you want to give it 15-20 seconds, feel free...but don&#39;t wait a minute or so or you&#39;ll end up with some black inedible rice like me.  So sad...but the non-burnt portions were good.

We also ordered the tteokkochi (rice cake bar) for the appetizer - awesome!  We&#39;re used to it served soaked in a slightly watered down version of that sauce, but this looked like they also panseared or grilled it so that it had a crispness to it.  A little over-priced, but quite tasty.

For those with an appetite, it&#39;s a clear decision but there is still value in non-AYCE places like 92 Town Korean BBQ. This was the old Solliphana but with new management and a different feel. Surprisingly, you could really taste the difference. 

I have always been a fan of AYCE Korean BBQ because for a few dollars more, you get so much more in return. I didn&#39;t think it was worth going to get kalbi unless it was AYCE. My experience at 92 Town proved me wrong. Even though I wasn&#39;t able to binge, I really enjoyed the quality in the meat and panchan (side dishes). The kalbi was well marbled and marinated even though the portion size was less than what I&#39;m used to. Shockingly, the most memorable part of the meal were all of the panchan. They all tasted better than anything I&#39;ve had at a kalbi buffet. 

If you didn&#39;t know, the side dishes are unlimited so you can get refills for no extra cost. I got three refills on my favorites which were the odeng (fish cake), moo (pickled radish), and the gennip (Korean herb). 

The service was typical of a Korean restaurant where you get your food and that&#39;ll be the last time you&#39;ll see your server until the bill. The trick is to call out to them if you need refills on drinks, rice, or panchan. It&#39;s cultural and not offensive at all - &#34;when in Rome&#34;, right?

Instead of writing this review, I should have been writing a Fogo de Chao review, because I made reservations for my Dad&#39;s birthday dinner, but when we got there, the freaking power was out! So, we turned around and went here instead.

This place used to be Soliphana, which was another Korean BBQ place, but that place sucked. Now it&#39;s 92 Town. Now, I kept trying to figure out what the significance of &#34;92&#34; was. And then after sounding out a few times, I figured it out. I kept thinking &#34;Goosheep Ee&#34; which is Korean for &#34;Ninety-Two,&#34; and couldn&#39;t come up with a real meaning, but then when I said &#34;Goo Ee&#34; which is &#34;Nine, Two,&#34; I realized it sounded like the Korean word for, basically, BBQ. Clever!

GALBI (Marinated Short Rib)
Cooked on the table gas grill. Meat was tender and the flame gave it a nice smoky flavor. The sweet and soy-saucy marinade really shined, and it was thanks to the sugars that burned that the smokiness really came out. Usually the meat is a little tough, but I think they did a very good job tenderizing or picking out good cuts of short rib. Not better than New Seoul in Algonguin, but right on its coattails -- which is really impressive because New Seoul uses wood coals, and this is just gas.

CHADOLBAEGI (Thinly Sliced Ribeye)
They, like most Korean places, bring out a stone pan with some oil on it, and put it on top of a portable butane burner, and bring that to your table. They heat it for a while, and then start putting the pieces of chadolbaegi on. It&#39;s really thinly sliced, so they don&#39;t have to cook for long. Our waitress cooked this for us, but it was very empty (probably due to the weather) so she cooked it for us. She dumped it on each of our plates as soon as they were ready. They were pretty tender and perfect in thickness, which made chewing easy. They&#39;re meant to be dipped in the sesame oil + salt + pepper mix, so the meat itself isn&#39;t seasoned, but there should be a beefy flavor to it, though masked in sesame oil. It&#39;s not hard to do chadolbaegi, but I&#39;d take Cho Sun Ok over this any day.

BANCHAN (Side Dishes)
About 8 came out. Now, even though the meats got pretty high marks, I really have to say, the entire meal suffered greatly because of the banchan. The number was good, but it was the quality. The kimchi was not very flavorful, but it was sour, and not the &#34;fermented beautifully&#34; kind of sour either. The kkakdoogie was ok, but I think it needed a little sweetness. It too was a bit sour. They had marinated eggplant which was ok, some leafy greens, cucumbers in, basically, vinegar (which was also missing some sweetness), and odeng. The poor kimchi and kkakdoogie take the largest part of the blame for this meal though. None of their banchan was really good. 

DWENJANG CHIGAE (Fermented Soy Soup)
This came with our BBQ meal. It was pretty good. It can&#39;t hang with Morangak in LA, but it is one of the best dwenjang chigaes I&#39;ve had in Chicago. Served in boiling hot stone bowl, it&#39;s very pungent, and seasoned well. There is no thought of being watered down. The veggies are soft, but not mushy. It was very well executed and tasted great!

DAEGU TANG (Cod Soup)
The broth is very refreshing. Not fishy at all. You could almost pick out individual ingredients in the broth. It&#39;s so simple, yet the flavors are harmonious. You taste garlic, black pepper, and Korean radish (moo) in the soup, seasoned perfectly and it warms your core instantly, yet gently. Seasoning was just spot on too. While tasting the broth you know it&#39;s inspired by the sea, but it never tastes like the sea or fishy.

Honestly, I only had the broth. I just had a sample of what my dad got, so I can&#39;t really tell you about how the cod was -- but he said it was good.

12 TOWN
One, Two sounds like &#34;eerie.&#34; It&#39;s eerie because the 3 star rating makes it seem like a halfway decent place, but in actuality, I didn&#39;t enjoy the meal. The individual parts were greater than the whole. Banchan is very important in Korean meals. 92 Town had a decent #, but quality was kinda low. Kimchi is the glue that binds a Korean meal. If I had to rate this whole dinner, I&#39;d give it a 3/10. 

I definitely will not be back for BBQ, although I had their Gamja Tang before and it wasn&#39;t bad, so maybe for a quick Korean lunch. BBQ - go to New Seoul in Algonquin!",22/01/14,575,3,1,5,7,9.4987,8.518,2.176,44.307,No,4593

Generally a big advocate of Korean restaurants for their value vs. price, but here at 92 Town, I actually felt ripped off.  Ordered soon du bu (tofu stew) and ttokbokki (spicy rice cakes).  Both items were prepared lacking proper ingredients. The rice cakes were combined with ones that should have been trashed (rice cakes are like 25 cents). If quality is bad, they should&#39;ve just thrown them away.  Maybe their beef items are better?  The tofu stew (soon du bu) weren&#39;t hot enough so the egg they put on top was barely warm and raw.  I just lifted it to the side in a small plate.

grovers-bar-and-grill-fox-river-grove,Chad C.,xI5sdu-lo19vLH78pviYxQ,hYCPvgJSesJDcLuLwFLUnA,"Fourth time here.  Was a Thursday night, and I don&#39;t know what happened to this place.  There were three people at the bar, and one table occupied.  We probably waited 15 minutes for a girl to come over, and she asked, &#34;Did you want menus?&#34;  I mean, are you kidding me?  So she comes back with menus, takes our drink orders.  Waitress (or waitress/bartender, I don&#39;t know) comes back, drops off the Coke and tea, and takes our order, and then goes back behind the bar.  A few minutes later, we hear her tell one of the three people sitting at the bar, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m sorry - I forgot your margarita&#34; - bad sign: three people sitting at the bar, and you forget one of their drinks.

In the meantime three high school girls come in and sit at the table next to us, and a kid with a wash rag in his pocket - I would assume he was there in order to clean tables - appears and walks over to their table.  And he talked to them...and talked to them...and talked to them.  Our food came out: I ordered the pulled pork with fries, my fiance the buffalo chicken wrap with fries.  Fries were cold, (as in not lukewarm) and the pulled pork was basically (more like EXACTLY) like what you get out of a tub of Lloyd&#39;s BBQ at Jewel with a squirt of BBQ sauce on top.  My fiance said there was next to no buffalo sauce on her chicken.  So we finished up (no one had ever stopped by to see if we needed refills, or to check if we needed anything for that matter), and I put my debit card on the table, went outside to have a cigarette, came back in, and my fiance said that still nobody had come by.  So we sat there, and I wondered aloud how many people have walked out of that place due to the total absence of service.  About five minutes later, the kid at the table next to us finally pried himself from the girls and walked by.  I said, &#34;Excuse me&#34;, and he grabbed our long-empty plates, and started to walk off.  I continued, &#34;Do you think you could find somebody to bring us a check?&#34;

The bartender came by a few minutes later with a fly by drop off of the check, and threw it right on top of my debit card (there was nothing else on the table at this point), and started to walk off again.  Hellllllloooooo????  I said, &#34;I think we&#39;d like to pay.&#34;  &#34;Oh, I didn&#39;t see the card&#34;, she told us.  Not sure how you could miss it, being that it was the only thing on the table.  Food was not good.  Service was nonexistent.  I can&#39;t imagine it having been worse, to be honest.

The next morning at the train I told some friends about our experience, and they all said that the place has gone completely down hill, and though they had all been there in the past, each said they wouldn&#39;t be returning again either.

It&#39;s a shame because it used to be a pretty decent place.",31/07/16,344,1,1,1,-16,0.37620000000000015,1.594,1.4900000000000002,24.915,No,2835

It was like a tortilla with buffalo sauce drenched in french dressing.

Liquor selection was minimal but the owner is interested in expanding and very service oriented.

grovers-bar-and-grill-fox-river-grove,Chris L.,p0FBiFj3C0DdxXdFPOnAPA,vQ2pd9WwW8a795dLE1_uXA,"I have to say after living in Fox Rover Grove for 11 years it was nice to see this building which was vacant at least 10 years finally have a new business. 

I finally had made it in after it being open for a few months. I strolled in about 9:30pm during the week and it wasn&#39;t busy at all understandably. The place was okay inside. Being that it&#39;s a new joint it seemed somewhat old and worn already.

I appreciated the bartender girl greeting me, being social and talkative. A lot of places may have dry unsociable bartenders, men as well as women and that often makes me stay away. And, there&#39;s more than a few places in the region with that.

I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. A standard bar and grill plate for me to gauge the overall food. The sesame seed bun was sort of dry, the chicken was breaded (my choice) but a bit over cooked and crunchy. The fries were lite on the portion but nothing special. They reminded me of the hot dog joint Mr Beefy&#39;s fries just down from Grovers. 

One disturbing issue I had was overhearing a couple of the staff complaining of newly recent rules such as fining the night before bartender $50 if the bar is messy or dirty the next day. There was a couple of other complaints which I&#39;ll spare. Nonetheless I got the impression that the management or owner are a bit strict and possibly unfair.

The place did not impress me at all I have to say. Will I try Grovers again? Most likely. But, if I have a similar experience again as the fore mentioned then that&#39;d be it.

Restaurant is small looks like they cater to lunch crowd not ideal for dinner just quick fast food style tacos.

I was most impressed by the verity of the salsa they offered, there is an authentic house made cilantro salsa you can purchase by bottle.   I got one and used it on grilled fish, it was amazing!!!

The staff working when we come in have always been nice and our order is generally ready in 10 minutes or so.  They have a decent amount of seating if you don&#39;t want to do take-out.

The carnitas meat was our favorite for the flavor and tenderness.  The chicken &amp; pastor is good as well.  Their barbacoa was the least flavorful I&#39;ve ever had - not sure if it was an off day for that recipe but we only ordered it once because of this.  The cesina (thin salted steak) was a bit tough.  I think if you order the Burrito Belly Bowl (no tortilla) you get more than if you just ordered a burrito served in a tortilla.  The Burrito Belly Bowl is plenty big and it comes with a big bag the size of a brown-bag lunch sack full of their house made tortilla chips.

This location is annoying to get into and the parking lot is aggravating, but the food was excellent. 
I&#39;m not much of a meat eater, especially somewhere new. With Mexican, it&#39;s easy to stick with a vegetarian order, so I did. I got a veggie taco and veggie tostada. Interestingly, I do not like cilantro, and despite their moniker, they omitted it from my order happily leaving beans, rice, avocado, tomato, onions and lettuce as the toppings (I nixed the sour cream too).  The taco was good, I only used one shell and it held together. The tostado was fenomenal, that&#39;s Spanish for awesome! I loved the shell; not at all greasy and it had been lightly salted. The crunch of the shell with the fresh veggies were a great combo.

We are both huge fans of Mexican food and this place is great - not to mention, they are open late. My husband is a fan of their Chicken burrito, I tried their taco dinner with 2 steak tacos and 1 barbacoa taco. We also got their nachos &amp; guacamole.

The chicken burrito is great, it is my husband&#39;s go-to whenever he eats at Cilantro, the chicken is marinated well and perfectly shredded (no awkward chunks of meat). The nachos and guacamole were okay, the guacamole could have used a bit more lime and the nachos were a little on the greasier side (which could be a good thing because they fry them there). The taco dinner was great! I was not disappointed, the portions are great and tacos are the same size as you would get at any other taqueria. The steak was delicious, the barbacoa was a good consistency (no fatty pieces, shredded well) but the flavor was a bit bland - I probably won&#39;t order the barbacoa again in the future.

They lost a star because the service while placing the order could&#39;ve been a little more organized, but I am more than understanding that this place is new and still has to iron out all the wrinkles. Also when my sister and I couldn&#39;t figure out where everyone got their salsas. There should be some kind of sign or maybe someone should&#39;ve told us when they were handing us our food.  

I order the Tripas taco with cilantro and onion and it was fire. They cooked it perfectly because I do not like mine overly crispy. 
Taco number 2 wasn&#39;t anything to write home about but it was still good. (Chorizo with cilantro and onion) 
My last taco was the barbacoa taco and it was delish. It was soft and it pulled apart so easily. 
The last thing I ate was the pork tamale. I thought it was bland and rather dry, but I still ate it because the avocado salsa is amazing.
I think I destroyed my tacos in less than a minute because of the avocado salsa. It definitely put the icing on the cake for me.
Next time I will be back to try more  from their menu. Fyi it is a little more on the pricier side compared to Los comales, but the food is good and the owner is really nice!",29/05/15,140,4,2,3,40,2.4932,1.83,0.881,13.289,No,1315

In all honesty, the reason I&#39;ve lived in Elk Grove Village and 6 minutes away from this establishment and had never visited was because of the front of the restaurant. It&#39;s not particularly appealing...but don&#39;t let that be the reason YOU don&#39;t try this restaurant out! 

This restaurant is truly authentic Mexican food and I appreciate that. The hostess is always accommodating, the waiters are always friendly and the food is always on point. 
They always have drink and meal specials and both are great options for trying something new or saving a little bit of dough. 

Once seated you&#39;ll always receive on-the-house chips and salsa - spicy and mild. The menu is pretty large and mostly in Spanish so definitely ask if there are meals you may not be familiar with! I order cheese quesadillas (how adventurous of me, I know) which come with fresh guacamole and sour cream. They&#39;re simple but super yummy. From the other bites of meals I&#39;ve tried, everything was hot and delicious as well. One thing I MUST mention is their cream of cilantro soup. Oh my God. It&#39;s truly the one thing that stands out at this restaurant aside from the two men that play guitars a table at a time. My boyfriend had introduced me to it when it was a Friday special and I must order it every time. Fortunately, I found out it&#39;s not just a Friday special anymore! You will seriously not regret it. I&#39;m not sure what the special occasion was but one Friday night my boyfriend and I had gotten free KahluÌÁ (?) dessert shots with whipped cream on the top when we had received our check at the end of our meal. They were so good the waitress brought us another one! Sadly, we had never received those again and never asked for them again but that was a nice surprise. 

Aside from the food, I think the ambience inside is what really allows for customers to have a &#34;true&#34; Mexican experience. It&#39;s colorful, fun, lit up, over decorated and truly resembles what a home or a restaurant south of the border may look like. 

Overall, Tapalpa is a must whether or not you live nearby like myself. The space is authentic and the food doesn&#39;t taste like just American-Mexican chain establishment. You will not be disappointed!",13/06/16,253,5,2,5,42,10.533700000000003,5.568999999999999,0.736,19.695,No,2401

Went in for lunch with a small group of coworkers. We requested split checks but they said they are too busy and are unable to do so. (It&#39;s okay, I understand if you want to provide good service and are unable to meet all the needs due to the situation.) The restaurant did not look too busy, but maybe they had a lot of delivery orders. 

We then ordered our food right away. First they brought out the cilantro soup. It was revolting. I am not a picky eater by any standards, but this was something else. Gross pale green color combined with a flavor that I cannot even describe. Avoid at all costs. 

I ordered street tacos with steak. After waiting for over THIRTY minutes, we still did not have our food. 10 minutes later we decided we need to leave to get back to work on time, we asked for our food to go. They seemed confused and it took them another 10 minutes to get our food. Yes, 50 minutes total. Our order consisted of simple lunch meals like tacos and burritos. 

The food wasn&#39;t great either. I have had much better tacos that did NOT take 50 minutes to make. 

I and all of my coworkers will now avoid this place at all costs. 

Worst part is that they did not communicate that they were so behind. If they were proactive and let us know how long it might take to get our food, I would definitely reconsider how my overall experience went.",21/09/16,158,1,1,0,-31,-0.5997,1.3050000000000002,2.3529999999999998,18.342,No,1398

First of all, they are really pricey for what they serve. Their margaritas are small, weak, overpriced, and taste salty (even though I did not get salt on the rim). The plates are plastic, like something I would have had in college. They don&#39;t have regular queso (what?!). The steak tacos were good (small, but good), but the pork were too spicy and covered in a sauce concoction that I was not a fan of.

After digging through Yelp for something we hadn&#39;t had in a while, I came across Tapalpa and was reminded of the good ol&#39; days of living in EG and frequenting this place at least twice a month, so we headed over.  I remember it to be very small and tight, so we decided to go early and beat the rush. 

When we got there around 5:30 on a Monday night, we were the only ones there.  Got seated, received the chips (yum) and salsa (eh) and the menus.  After learning that they only make spinach enchiladas on Fridays and Saturdays, which was odd, the wife decided on the Veggie fajita burrito.  I got the chicken enchiladas, and mom got the veggie tostadas.  There was definitely a LOT of food, which was deemed more than fair for the price.  

Enchiladas were tasty, as were the beans and rice that came with the dinner.  Mom and wife shared the tostadas and didn&#39;t have room for the burrito, which was fine by me because hey, that&#39;s tomorrow&#39;s lunch!

The burrito only jad steak and  lettuce inside.  We asked for sour cream cheese etc to make sure.   And nada.  They didnt care about the meal or explain the delay. As we wait for our check a party of 4 comes in orsers and gets thier food before we got our check.   Just horid thing to experience.

I am celebrating my thirteen anniversary at work next week and I have been visiting Tapalpa since I started at this job. I don&#39;t think they were a brand new restaurant at that time, so I&#39;m thinking that they got to be doing something right to have such a long standing history with their doors open for business. 

Here are the things that I love!  It&#39;s a welcoming place. The owner and staff are so nice. The mole is dark and tasty - muy bien!  They are plenty of seating - both inside and outside. I used to actually take a lunch break and dine in. During the warmer months, I recall dining outside sometimes. It&#39;s a nice break in the day. After dinner, I&#39;ve always received a sweet dessert shot. I&#39;m not much of a drinker, but I sure enjoy that treat!  Plus, they have a lunchtime special now that is $6.95. Sounds like the perfect carryout lunch to me!

A few of my not so favorite things?  Their chips are boring. The salsa works, but the chips aren&#39;t worth the calories. I don&#39;t love the tomato chunks mixed in with the chicken. I&#39;m sure they do it to add flavor, but I don&#39;t like chunky tomatoes in anything. This is a personal preference. 

They&#39;re not a fancy spot, but the food is consistent.  And the people are great!  I&#39;m grateful that Tapalpa has lasted as long as I have in the area. Here&#39;s to many more years, my friends!",04/11/13,156,4,1,5,-14,5.339,5.0920000000000005,1.384,18.523999999999997,No,1432

Glad we saw this place. The decor both inside and out, scream authentic Mexican. We were sat immediately. Our waitress was very nice. She seemed a little frazzled most of the time though. Maybe she was new. We got a pitcher of margaritas for the table. They were delicious and strong. The menu has a lot on it which makes for a tough choice, but I opted for something different. I tried the pollito poblano. It&#39;s cheese inside a pepper, wrapped in a chicken... I know. Weird. But it was awesome. The other people had a burrito and the enchiladas. Both were very good as well. We were given a green herby soup before our meal and a shot of dessert liqueur after the meal. Overall, I am a fan.",30/07/14,91,4,1,3,9,2.8436,3.334,1.329,13.337,No,800

The fiance had steak chimichanga and it was ginormous. He said the steak was tender and full of flavor. 
I had the chicken flautas,which is my go to..and it was bomb. The crispy tortilla shell was not too greasy but crisp and had a good crunch..and the chicken was so tender..definitely not over cooked. The spices definitely tasty. Rice and beans were also BOMB.

The waiter was very attentive, probably a little over attentive, in my opinion. I wanted a regular margarita but he mistook my order and I ended up getting the $1.50 special margarita. It wasn&#39;t very good but I could certainly taste the tequila. I suppose if you are looking for a bargain for some drinks, this would be a good option.

The chips and salsa were okay, pretty standard for any Mexican restaurant. For dinner, I got the quesadilla with chicken. It was plated in a really interesting way, almost like a roll rather than flat. It was pretty tasty but the sour cream and guacamole servings were a bit small. I thought the price of the entrÌ©e was reasonable. However, as others have said, some other entrees and sides are a little bit ridiculous. For instance, 9$ for a small guacamole? I think the regular size was $15, that&#39;s about the same price you&#39;d pay for an appetizer at a swanky restaurant.

tapalpa-mexican-restaurant-elk-grove-village,Ken K.,GI2DSFIXDX8yI_p4iJeYwQ,rxaBxLUli1Ff6rU4Bq6oEw,"Not a fan. 
First, a little background - I work in Woodfield area, wife came to take me to lunch day after Christmas...tried to take her to a great little Mexican place I went to with co-workers, all of whom were off that day (found out later it was called Los Compadres) - got lost in Elk Grove (don&#39;t go that way often, all the streets there look alike - grey and dingy) and somehow stumbled into Tapalpa. 

Resurant is typical cheap mexican place in a strip mall - slightly tacky, plastic tablecloths, etc. etc. etc....no problem, that&#39;s what we were looking for. The prices however, were not that of a cheap little mexican place. Now - I like a good meal and am willing to pay for it...but this place was WAY out of line with the other tacky mexican places in strip malls in the area....lunch of an appitizer, a burrito, a quesedella and 2 diet cokes was $43.44....$52 bucks w/tip. Place I was thinking of (and about 3 others in area off the top of my head) would have been less than $40, tip included. Was it worth it? Comparatively speaking, no. But let&#39;s discuss the food:

Chips and Salsa - included as in most places in the area - not bad, but did not stand out.
Queso Fundito - again, uneventful - but I did like they served it in a taco salad shell - i think the shell soaked in a lot of the grease, which is nice.
Steak Burrito - Steak was tender, big pieces, and of good quality. But bland, as were the rest of the ingredients
Quesadellia  (SP)- wife ordered this, when asked how it was she said &#34;fine&#34;....which could mean a variety of things....none of which would be in the 4-5 star range.

In closing - not BAD, but nothing to write home about...and NOT worth the money.",26/12/12,216,2,1,3,1,2.3521,1.372,1.653,11.977,No,1706

tapalpa-mexican-restaurant-elk-grove-village,Jay W.,JH10j9hmiDGnsIG4fbvbfw,AtIjAIAWagGysuYUvkvZaA,"First of all, I know everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but this is NOT one of the best, or even better, Mexican restaurants in the burbs.  Not by a long shot.  I know they&#39;ve been here a while, but from what I saw people seem to like the booze more than the food.  I think they have a following, and good for them, it&#39;s just not for us.

We checked it out at the insistence of my sister, who had a great time here with her family recently.  But, I should have known, my sister doesn&#39;t know Mexican food.  And her kids, well, they raved about it - but the only other MX food they&#39;ve ever had is Taco Bell.

I have a more discriminating and experienced palette for this food, and I was not impressed.  The food is average to average plus, not bad but not remarkable, as it should be for the prices they charge.

Chips and salsa are weak, chips taste commercially made and the salsa reminds me of the jarred style.  I don&#39;t think it is jarred, but it reminds me of the &#34;Pace&#34; style.  Mild, which we like, but has that jarred consistency/flavor.  Salty, tomatoey flavor overwhelms the rest of the ingredients.

I got the carnitas, which I will say were NOT greasy.  However, they were borderline dry.  It was $15 and they gave me about 4 oz. of meat, with a bunch of beans and some other sides/garnish.  Not at all impressed.  My wife&#39;s tacos were equally underwhelming - and pricey.  $13 for a taco dinner.

Lastly, service.  The waiter was decent, except everything moved at SLOW MOTION.  Half an hour to get our food after ordering.  Both the waiter and owner (presumably) came by to check on us as we sat there, waiter gave us some lame excuse about too many carry-out orders.  Hey, that&#39;s YOUR problem - don&#39;t leave your dining room customers waiting.  The owner asked us how everything was, when we told her we&#39;d been waiting way too long she said she&#39;d check on our food - but instead went to the counter and started chatting on the phone and doing other things.  She never followed up.

The waiter finally came to tell us he would bring the check, he then proceeded to take food and drink orders from FOUR TABLES before he made his way to the back.  Next time we saw him he had a huge tray of drinks in his hand.  Maybe it finally registered with him that we were perturbed, so he set the tray down and brought our check.  Total wait for the check, about twenty minutes.

If you want MUCH better food and half the price, but no liquor or atmosphere to speak of, try Los Compadres on Algonquin.  If you want MUCH better food slightly cheaper with great service in a nice setting and liquor service, try Hacienda de Roselle.  I&#39;ve had Mexican food all over, they are two of the better places around.",18/04/14,313,2,1,2,-27,1.6932,2.323,1.6480000000000001,30.029000000000003,No,2762

As it should be, they serve you chips and salsa before the meal. Some places like to get stingy and give you a small bowl of chips. Not here. They brought out pile after pile of chips. Good chips. Crunchy and not greasy. They went well with the fresh salsa and hot sauce.

It was a Tuesday, so I started out with their drink special: $1.50 margarita. Not a fan. Only thing I didn&#39;t like. Too salty. Blech. Switched over to horchata and was much happier. I don&#39;t even know that I needed that margarita to begin with because they bring you out cute little Kahlua shots at the end of the meal - at least for our group. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s typical.

My friend Mike and I decided to maximize our Mexican by both ordering an entree and splitting it. He got the red snapper with white wine, butter and garlic. It was topped with diced tomato, some cilantro, onion and olives. It was blow your mind good. There is nothing worse than having badly cooked fish and I was worried it might come out dry. It was moist and flavorful. I also dislike olives, but I overlooked it and enjoyed everything that it came with. My choice was one of their Tapalpa specialties, a broiled skirt steak covered in poblano sauce and cheese. All entrees were served with a side of refried beans, rice and a small bowl of vegetable soup. The soup would be perfect if you&#39;re sick. Heck, it&#39;s perfect if you&#39;re not sick!",04/05/11,235,5,2,5,21,6.788200000000001,5.592,1.903,27.507,No,2014
tapalpa-mexican-restaurant-elk-grove-village,Renita M.,8gYDk0qh586uzePzzU763g,gwHNqX7XYLzQDqfQG9Rtrg,"Arroz con pollo. It means &#34;rice with chicken.&#34; To me, growing up eating a lot of Puerto Rican food, arroz con pollo means a specific dish: rice with bone-in chicken parts cooked in it, fragrant with adobo and saffron, small bits of veggies, possibly some ham and olives or capers.

I&#39;ve discovered, though, that if you order this at a Mexican restaurant you are likely to get something that contains both chicken and rice, but may not otherwise resemble the dish described above. At our regular haunt in Bloomingdale, the chicken is boneless and the veggies are large chunks, but it&#39;s similar.

At Tapalpa, you will receive something else entirely -- my arroz con pollo was large-diced chunks of chicken breast with tomato, onion and peppers, served over rice and slathered with cheese.

Which is not to say it isn&#39;t delicious. It is. And after eating too many chips and my delightful little cup of vegetable soup, I have about 2/3 of my giant plate of arroz con pollo to eat for lunch today.

I came here with my NW Suburban friends for dinner on a weeknight. Tapalpa is hard to miss though it is close to a large outdoor shopping area along Arlington Heights Road. 

We got a long booth out of the way of most of the commotion in the restaurant. Certainly our service was nothing to complain about. I ordered a horchata as my drink. It was a bit strong on the cinnamon, but not bad at all, though I prefer more of a vanilla flavor personally. I got the bandarilla special, which was a huge platter with two fried tortillas with shredded chicken rolled up inside, rice, beans and a scoop of both guacamole and sour cream on top. Looking at the serving size, it&#39;s easily two or maybe 3 meals, depending on how much you like to pig out. 

As we waited for our food, the chips and salsa kept coming. I particularly liked their hotter variety of salsa, which though it packed a punch was very flavorful.

While I didn&#39;t run my usual &#34;burrito benchmark&#34; test on them, I was very pleased with my choice of dinner. I got flan as my dessert to complete what was a fantastic meal at a nice Mexican place.",12/05/11,135,4,2,5,39,4.9915,2.26,0.158,10.582,No,1195

I&#39;ve kept the same basic criteria in the places I&#39;ve visited thus far:
1) Margarita tastiness (regular, on the rocks, with salt - I&#39;m keepin&#39; it real here)
2) Chips and salsa crunch and tastiness (I like a little heat but not anything obscene)
3) Chicken burrito awesomeness

They did really, REALLY well on 1 &amp; 2. 
The burrito was substantial in size and the chicken was moist but it seemed to miss the mark with the rice and had 0 heat but still tasty.

Tapalpa had an added bonus that blew my mind. A 2-man Mariachi band. I couldn&#39;t help but do the white man overbite and dance before, during and after my meal.

Check this place out. The chips are crunchy. The salsa was addicting. And the margarita (get the Cabo Wabo kind!) were so tasty and smooth. The best to date.

The soup they bring with the meal is always nice--I particularly enjoyed the cream of cilantro.

The margaritas are fantastic, but then it is pretty hard to mess up a margarita, I&#39;d think.

It is a bit pricey for standard Mexican fare, but as somewhere to go on occasion, I&#39;m willing to pay a bit more.

Came with my girlfriends one rainy December night, and we had the mariachis that wouldn&#39;t go away--one was flirting with my Spanish speaking girlfriend.

I called Tapalpa and was fortunate to speak directly to Abraham, the owner.  He couldn&#39;t have been more helpful or accomodating.  I ordered the&#34; hot taco bar&#34; for 50!  No problem.  When I told him how much my husband enjoyed their chorizo, he threw in a small bowl at no charge for him.

He arrived exactly on time with his own tablecloth, wrapped settings and plates, colorful bowls filled with the freshest salsa, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, and queso.  Four huge piping hot chaffing dishes of beans, delicious rice, ground beef, and chicken for filling.  Plus a huge basket of tortilla chips, baskets of warm soft tortillas and another basket of hard shell tortillas.

He asked nothing of me and was in and out in 20 minutes and was not intrusive to the party in the least!  He is coming back to pick up his materials.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, a three meets the standard; however, this--to me--is a little too Americanized. Very comfortable and decent food; but a four star has a certain vine and a five star simply UPS the ante in terms of food authenticity.

tapalpa-mexican-restaurant-elk-grove-village,Ling L.,l2xCVVInBHnHjj2YrL5vig,U22bz10uvVNElOz4FXTtOw,"Not many Mexican places impress me here because the meat lacks definition, and the sides of rice and beans are mediocre.

Tapalpa surprises me with their flavorful entrees, salsa and fantastic service.

The menu offers the usual fare, but there&#39;s a section that boasts dishes from the town of Tapalpa, hence the name. Duh. :)

We ordered the arrachera con salsa y queso (numero 49). It is a broiled skirt steak in a pool of Poblano pepper and sour cream sauce, covered with melted cheese. The steak comes nicely medium as requested and we can taste every fine seasoning in it along with the light sour cream Poblano sauce. It is definitely the more preferred dish. The burrito Suizo did not disappoint either but it&#39;s obvious which is the clear favorite.

Prices are steep. Our #49 costs $15.50, an ouch for lunch. And the supreme fajita (chicken, shrimp, steak) is a whopping $24.50. 

Good thing is the portions are enough for 2 meals so the price pretty much evens out.

They have specials every day. Check their web site for details.

Our server started the conversation in Spanish and was pleased we attempted the bare minimum He was especially wowed when I rolled my r&#39;s in the ordering of the arrachera.  

We will return. It sure beats Pepe&#39;s and La Magdalena. 

Note to drivers without GPS: it&#39;s not easy to find this place as it&#39;s tucked at the corner of a tiny strip. Coming from Busse woods, along Arlington Heights, it&#39;s going to be the first strip to your right as you curve around the bend.",10/08/07,185,4,2,5,42,5.445,2.748,0.107,17.145,No,1533

They arrived; no seasoning on the chicken - bland.  That which accompanied the entree, chips, onions, etc. was equally bland.  We ordered drinks; weak.

They have the best margaritas I&#39;ve ever had, and their Wednesday special &#34;Pica Pica&#34; is the most amazing thing.  Everything on the menu is great.

Their salsa is made fresh by hand every day, and the same can be said for their astonishingly delicious chipotle sauce.

The staff is friendly, helpful, polite, and will make you feel right at home.  They have regular parties for almost every holiday.  Sometimes they have a mariachi band playing.  On the weekends they have 2 guys with guitars walking around playing songs for people.  They&#39;re really talented and cool.

The place is clean, the atmosphere is fun, and they&#39;re open til 10pm every night (except Sundays because they&#39;re closed).

Highly recommended for anyone who likes Mexican food.  We always take visitors from out of town there, and when they come back they ALWAYS ask us to take them back here. Tapalpa is the best!",20/11/12,115,5,2,5,25,7.4783,5.025,0.0,8.975,No,996

I believe they have raised their prices recently and if you are an avid lover of Mexican food, you will know that there is much better, authentic food available at a more affordable price. 

Their horchata is also terrible- they don&#39;t use a machine to make it but instead a powder, so the drink tastes way too chalky. The margaritas are cheap and for good reason- they are small and watered down. Their poor service added to an overall &#34;Meh&#34; experience.

Yelp helped me find this pearl in Suburbia. It is a Mexican Restaurant which they have in Austin Tx. Located in a strip mall. Kind of tacky inside and out, but very good food and excellent service. Strolling Mariachi&#39;s  too! The honey knew what she wanted as she peeked on line at the menu. She chose the combo of Bistec (steaak) and stuffed chicken breast with a great sauce. Of course it came with rice and refried beans. I chose on the the Friday specials, enchilleda&#39;s stuffed with spinach and cheese. Mine was great. Just enough of a kick to know it is a bit spicy. It comes to you slowly, not blowing  your mouth out with heat. The honey liked her entree. The portions were more than ample and at a reasonable price. The lady also had 2 (count them) Apple Martini&#39;s. I was a bit fearful of having to carry her out. As a little plus, the waiter brought a small teas cup of Baileys, butterscotch and whip cream topping. A nice finish. But the ambience was great and not rushed at all. Being two days b4 Xmas, the restaurant was decorated and the staff wore their finest and Santa&#39;s helpers hats. Cute. It is a local joint as there was a lot of conversation at the main door between patrons and staff. For all you Chicago food snobs, they have plastic tablecloths and good food without unbrellas in your drinks. Didn&#39;t even think of going to White Castle after dinner (LOL). Wait staff and busboys very attentive and personable. I&#39;ll be back....

tapalpa-mexican-restaurant-elk-grove-village,M M.,ai5xAV3B9OO7roqG6GiZzA,9SyBn7Qrwe3Q8Ah7XuLzhA,"Tapalpa can be summed up in one word: warm.  The atmosphere, the service, and obviously the food all convey a great sense of warmth.

The decor makes for a comfortable eating environment.  The soft pink glow of the place evokes the west coast of Mexico at the last moments of sunset (aren&#39;t I a freakin&#39; poet?).  To some people the atmosphere might be a little tacky, but to me it feels like the perfect place for Mexican food.

The service was quick and friendly.  One of the big points in its favor was the way the staff treated what appeared to be its regulars.  Some customers were enthusiastically gretty by name when they entered, others had waitstaff more than happy to chat at the tables.  Service that personal and attentive makes a huge difference.

But most important was the food, and it was great.  The menu is huge and includes standard Mexican favorites mixed with a few more specialized dishes from the region of Mexico in which the actual city of Tapalpa is located.  I got the Tuesday special, banderillas, which were essentially giant chicken flautas.  The chicken was that perfect taqueria style, cooked and seasoned to absolute deliciousness.  Great rice and beans too.

So overall Tapalpa is just pleasant.  Despite how close to EGV we live, we tend not to go there for anything, but when our travels bring us north, it&#39;s nice to know there&#39;s an excellent, friendly Mexican restaurant waiting for us.",25/01/11,162,4,2,5,22,9.1254,4.715,0.0,11.285,No,1438

My son picked around it and I spent $7.00 on a meal that he didn&#39;t even eat.  My taco salad had one dop of sour cream so I asked for more and was charged $1.25 for it.  Really? I had to go to the hostess and get my check come to find my waiter sitting there chatting it up with his co-workers.  I said Adios and left.

Used to be I chose restaurants based solely on another sign criteria: &#34;most credit cards accepted.&#34; But these days my standards are different.

The Riverview is a neighborhood tavern in search of a neighborhood. And one can&#39;t see the river from any location at the joint, tho surely one could back in 1936. Now there are houses and strip malls in the way.

What&#39;s great about the Riverview is a lengthy menu and nightly specials; Friday nites you&#39;ll find the local ubiquitous fish fry. Sundays nites, it&#39;s all you can eat &#34;broasted&#34; chicken.  The bird comes with slaw, a roll, and choice of fries, baked, or mashed.

Tried the onion rings, which were panko coated, very crispy, quality onions, great flavor.  Came with a ramekin of ranch, I sure don&#39;t know whomever decided that ranch was the ultimate dipping sauce (lobbyists from Hidden Valley?) but it doesn&#39;t do it for me; nor does thousand island, for that matter.

The chicken was great, came with fries and slaw, the fries seemed baked, but the waitress affirmed they were deep-fried.  The question only arose because they weren&#39;t greasy. (Which is a good thing).  There was a patty melt somewhere on the table, it wasn&#39;t prepared exactly as ordered, but was satisfactory nonetheless.

Returned for the Friday nite AYCE fish fry. Big pieces of cod, choice of tater, and slaw. Less than $10.  Add a buck and a half and you can get two pieces of broasted chicken with your fish.  Good deal.",15/07/13,208,4,2,5,46,5.639600000000001,3.056,0.065,18.878999999999998,No,1663

Went in at 7:30p on a Friday night, dining room was about 80% full. Fish came out about 15 minutes after we ordered. Dark with burnt tips on the outside, just under that the breading was completely mushy, fish under that was so-so. No flavor or seasoning at all. We ate it only because we were so hungry. Told the waitress, kitchen offered to make us more to take home with us....why? To reheat and be horrible later?

EDIT to reply to owner: This was Friday 2/12. We brought the issues to the attention of our waitress and she told us she would talk to the kitchen about it. As I mentioned we were hungry so we kept nibbling on the fish, our potatoes and the fried dough nuggets. We didn&#39;t ask for the fish to be remade because from looking around at the other tables it appeared that was your &#34;normal&#34; offering; they were all chocolate brown to black in color. By the time she returned it had been so long that we weren&#39;t hungry anymore. She left again, we waited again, she returned with the offer to take some home with us. Again, why would I want to take home more of something I didn&#39;t like...only to reheat it and have it be even worse? Call me crazy, but I don&#39;t like reheated burnt mush. I didn&#39;t even know it was possible to both burn something in a deep fryer and have it be mushy...unless you&#39;re par cooking fish and holding it far too long on the side before a final fry and plate.

I&#39;ve only been here once with my dad and stepmom. He wanted fish fry and that sounded good. They visit Riverview fairly often, so we headed in. The parking lot is a little weird and if you aren&#39;t careful, other people will block you in. There is a ramp up to the front door (handicapped accessible!).

The hostess is hilarious!  She walked around singing to herself all night. Awesome!  And when my dad teased her...she chuckled and played along. He&#39;s such a dork!  I love him regardless. 

Our server was quick and he too put up with my Dad&#39;s b.s.  I didn&#39;t even look at the full menu. They gave us a paper daily special sheet. All you can eat fish (cod...I think) with two pieces of chicken. It was only $1 or so more than the all you can eat fish alone. And I was able to get white meat only...no extra charge. Bonus!  

Before the food came out, beer nuggets with a side of pizza sauce showed up. I switched to ranch dressing, but these things are yummy!  Fried pizza dough. Not fancy. But tasty. And smart. I&#39;ll eat less fish if I eat these things. My step mom refrained. Dad and I did not. ;-)

The fish was pretty good. Not my favorite, but okay. The chicken on the other hand was awesome!  Winner, winner, chicken dinner!!!  I loved it!  Crispy. Juicy. Seasoned well. Sooooo good!!!

It&#39;s a simple place with a lot of locals. Not necessarily a destination restaurant (except maybe for the chicken). This is the second location with only three owners in over 60 (I think) years. If you&#39;re in the neighborhood, you should probably stop by.

I seriously sat after he hung up in my ear and was a little amazed..Next, the delivery guy sat in the driveway for 5 mins before he finally got out of the car, and delivered a large lukewarm pizza. The pizza sauce has a weird taste, the crust was so mushy you couldn&#39;t really tell there was any crust, it just blended into the cheese and toppings.

I had heard of it before but never been. The yankees were on tv so I wanted to sit in the bar area(the dining room is seperate). There were 3 or 4 people sitting at the bar eating, but we took one of the tables. Our waitress(also the bartender) came right over with menus and asked us our drink order. I ordered a Coors light and my friend ordered a miller. The beer on tap is only 2.50 on tuesdays!! I figured that while she got us our drinks I could look through the menu and decide what I was having...I was wrong!! This menu is HUGE, I could not decide between like 4 choices, the poor waitress came and left 3 times before I finally could decide on one meal. While I was looking at the menu she brought us dough nuggets for free!! They were really hot and good, a perfect starter when you can&#39;t decide on what to order!
I ended up ordering the grilled chicken panini deluxe. This came with fries(i changed them to cheese fries) and a pickle. The chicken was so tender and seriously melted in your mouth. The lemon pepper seasoning was not over powering for the chicken. and the garlic tomatos were a perfect finishing piece for the sandwich, and I usually HATE tomatoes, but the way these were combined with the lemon pepper chicken was amazing.

During dinner we ordered an apple pie shot(only 2 bucks). This was one of the better apple pie shots that I have had, and it came in a regualar glass...wayyyyy more then a shot : )

The broasted chicken dinner is also outstanding. 

Beer nuggets -- excellent, I ask for a cup of cheese sometimes. 

This is the place where everyone can find something on the menu. I like it because the bar is on one side, restaurant on the other you if you wanted to have a quiet or low key dinner, you could. If you wanted to stay after for cocktails, you can.

It&#39;s a local independent place with a cozy feel and a huge menu.  Each time I came and experienced bad service and nasty food, I gave the place another chance.. I really wanted it to work out but alas it&#39;s now on my &#34;never again&#34; list.

Most of the other reviews focus on the takeout pizza, or the bar itself.  Maybe those are the Riverview&#39;s strengths.. it would explain how they are still in business.  My experiences with the Riverview have all been seated in the dining area of the restaurant.  Almost every time I&#39;ve been there, the restaurant area was deserted and the waitress looked surprised to have a sit down customer.  Service was extremely slow, and the food always disgusting.  

Hint: When a small restaurant has a huge menu with 200 items on it, you know the ingredients aren&#39;t fresh and the kitchen probably doesn&#39;t remember how to prepare what you&#39;ve ordered so they will just make it up as they go with whatever they find in the freezer.

Well.. fellow yelpers, this place is the exception!   They have an amazing variety of entrees, appetizers and desserts to feed the whole family.  

Lets talk about the ribs...  they fall off the bone and are simply delicious. 

I am a huge fan of their meatloaf sandwich... eat half and take the other home for lunch tomorrow.

white-cottage-pizzeria-elgin,Mark B.,Zs4v2spqvoa-O_AzfQ42bA,WKm_x_Sz6hDcwvXi1VkAGQ,"We ordered (delivery) from White Cottage on a Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised.

DÌ©cor: n/a

Staff: The person taking the orders on the phone was only half-paying attention, as I had to repeat the order several times, but it arrived correctly so I guess it isn&#39;t a big deal. The delivery was also rather prompt; I wouldn&#39;t say &#34;incredibly fast&#34; but it was satisfactory.

Food: We ordered two large pizzas for four guys and, upon arrival, felt like we under-ordered. However, the pizzas were pretty hearty! Even though they were thin crust they packed a punch and filled us up (we didn&#39;t even end up finishing both of them and we all eat more than our fair share). The pizza arrived warm/hot and ready to eat. The taste was very enjoyable and the toppings were generous. There wasn&#39;t any crushed red pepper or accoutrements but, then again, we didn&#39;t ask for any...

Value: The two pizzas were pretty pricey in the end. Add on a delivery tip and it was a pretty expensive meal all things considered.

white-cottage-pizzeria-elgin,Michael K.,mj1rmmKEkx_fDZDI2XmlaQ,OLtfLutox_a8uX5I96hjwA,"I&#39;ve been shoving White Cottage pizza down my gullet since I was a kid.

I remember the original &#39;store&#39; if you can even call it that.  A small hole in the wall in Wood Dale.  This was our local pizza place and I was happy as a pig in sauce when they opened this store in Elgin.  They&#39;ve gone from that tiny place to a few larger stores.  Good for them, I say.  

There&#39;s got to be something good about the pizza, right?

You&#39;re double-dog-damn right there is.  This is like crack in flat box.  If I could light one corner and just inhale it, I would.

Even from this new store I still love this stuff.  It&#39;s a bit of cruise for me still, and I&#39;ve got to pick up as they won&#39;t deliver to me in Saint Charles (get on that White Cottage, the pizza down here sucks), but once every couple of months I make the run then gobble this goodness down like a Roman pizza eating champion performing for Caesar in the Coliseum.

I&#39;ll agree that their pricing can be a bit much.  Calamari is like 10 bucks now, so I&#39;ve stopped that habit and they&#39;re definitely not cheap, but just the nostalgia factor has me handing over my crumpled greenbacks every few months.  

I see other reviews commenting negatively on the service.  I haven&#39;t had that displeasure and probably wouldn&#39;t notice if they slapped me and called me Nancy, such is the frothy state of borderline madness in which I usually arrive on their doorstep in anticipation of this tasty treat from yesteryear.

white-cottage-pizzeria-elgin,Nicole W.,prfPtWbwFQ2VmHWUOU-87Q,JLDBeojGTG57NvQ6v83juA,We ordered a Stadium pizza and another small on Halloween. The girl rang up the wrong ingredients so the pizza was made wrong which we didn&#39;t realize until after we were home with it. Pick up time was 45 minutes. We waited another 15 after that for it to finish cooking. When we called about the mistake they said they would deliver another in an hour and half! Not exactly feasible when you have a house full of people. We agreed but then the manager called back and said they&#39;d only replace it with a smaller size unless we returned the original pizza. Again we were all starving so half was already gone! It took over an hour for the replacement to arrive. Next one of the kids found an inch long piece of metal baked into the crust of the smaller pizza. Metal!!! Well they just lost the business of 6 families that night.

Had some of the fried appetizers before; really got the impression that they came out of a box. They were good and hot, but a bit bland. 

Service is good and fast. Delivery drivers are great about calling if they&#39;re not sure where to go, instead of driving around for a hour while your pizza gets cold.

It was absolutely perfect; perfectly assembled, perfectly baked and perfect tasting.

Their pizza is perfectly cheesy with the right amount of sauce and it looks great and tastes fantastic.

I also noticed capers as a topping, which is intriguing and will have to try that too.

ta-wan-thai-restaurant-algonquin,Peter R.,mnjUNPVq6UMVZQ5TgQpAkA,VUHpJEUzb77GOmXKXBOlgQ,"I have been to many Thai restaurants in the Chicagoland area, more than I can remember off-hand. My wife had eaten lunch at Ta-Wan Thai, which is fairly &#34;new&#34; in the area, and had said it was &#34;just OK.&#34; I decided to see for myself.

It&#39;s a small restaurant, but nice and cozy with comfortable seating and very clean. I was immediately greeted with the familiar smell of real fish sauce, a hallmark of Thai food and a condiment I use often. My server was super friendly and I received my food fast, before my green tea even cooled down. I ordered the &#34;Bun&#34; noodle dish with beef, as well as some pot stickers.

To put it simply, the food was top notch Thai. The beef was lean, tender, and delicious. It was clearly high quality meat with no stringy or nasty bits, which can happen often in Asian restaurants in this area. The sauce had that addictive quality and they clearly used the available ingredients to their best ability. The basil was fresh and delicious, and my server had no problems at all bringing me a plate of it to mix in with my food since I wanted more.

To sum it all up, the great service, excellent food, and fair prices will guarantee I&#39;ll be coming back here. It&#39;s every bit as good as my other favorite Thai place, plus they have some menu items that you don&#39;t always see (e.g., larb, papaya salad).",24/10/16,162,5,3,5,59,5.2941,2.9650000000000003,0.351,9.684000000000001,No,1362

My daughter always orders the Pad Thai and she loves it. She usually eats half of her order when she gets it and the other half the next day. The portions are huge. My hubby orders something different every time and he has never had a disappointing dish. 

One evening we were at the commons and decided last minute to grab food from Ta-Wan Thai. We ordered it to go and the wait staff did everything they could to make our wait comfortable. They offered us a table and water and treats for the kids while we waited. They were beyond sweet.

Both my son and I ordered the Pad Kee Mao. When the server brought it to the table, she said they ran out of the wide noodles, so had to substitute the thin ones. She said, &#34;I hope that&#39;s OK&#34;. Actually, it wasn&#39;t OK. One of our favorite things about this dish is the wide noodles. She should&#39;ve told us about the noodles when we ordered - or at least before she brought the dish to the table! I ordered medium spice in this dish just like last summer when I had it for the first time (see previous review). This time it was SO spicy that I could barely taste the food itself. So, I wish they&#39;d be consistent with the heat level. 

My husband ordered the pho with the combination, which was supposed to be beef, pork, chicken and shrimp. It came to the table with beef only. Because he didn&#39;t want to return it to the kitchen and have them start all over again, he ate it anyway - though we did call attention to the error to the server. Husband said the pho was delicious though...I also tasted the broth and it was amazing.

And, like last August when we were first here, they didn&#39;t serve the dishes to our table at the same time. Very unnerving when two people get their food and then we have to sit there and wait (while the food gets cold) until the third person is served. I received a private message from someone at the restaurant saying &#34;servers only have two hands&#34; and this is true. However, you will notice at any other restaurant, food is served all at the same time. Most restaurants bring out the dishes on a tray if they can&#39;t carry all the plates at once. They also carry - or have a bus person bring over - one of those little folding tripods to set the tray down on. They then serve the plates from that - all at once. Another solution would be to have two servers bring out the food at once to the table. Or, it wouldn&#39;t be a problem in the first place if the server brought out the two dishes and then said to the third (and/or fourth, etc) person/s at the table, &#34;Your food will be right out&#34; - and actually went back to the kitchen and brought those dishes out ASAP. But that&#39;s not the case here. We sat and waited for a few minutes with our food while the third person waited for theirs. Like I said, our food was getting cold. It would be rude to start eating in front of the other people while they didn&#39;t have their food.",26/07/16,272,3,2,4,31,3.3736000000000006,2.0860000000000003,0.43299999999999994,22.480999999999995,No,2574

ta-wan-thai-restaurant-algonquin,Jason G.,X0ky9yFDYMoho-4dIpr5FA,N53vzIARaixxaSgQurB03w,"I was extremely happy when I heard that there was a new Thai restaurant in the area.  It&#39;s not in the most visible spot from Randall Rd., but conveniently located by a lot of shops in the Algonquin Commons. 
We first walked in and were greeted by a pleasant young girl.  We were surprised to not see any other dinners in the restaurant on a Friday night.  I made mention that we found them via Yelp.  They definitely need to do some advertising to draw in new customers, or they will likely have the same fate as the Mediterranean place that was here before them.
The server was very attentive and even had my wife check-in on Facebook to receive a free appetizer, Mee Krob. I had never heard or tried it before and we were happy that we had the chance to...we all liked it (kids included).
I started off with the Tom Yum Soup with Chicken and it was &#34;off the hook&#34; good!  This is a must try for any real deal Thai fan and it did not disappoint.
My wife always orders a Thai Iced Tea and the one here is super sized!  Usually, she sucks it down and has little left for the meal, but this one lasted.
My daughters shared the chicken Thai Fried Rice and they chowed it down.  My wife had her Pad See Ew, which she orders at every Thai restaurant we go to, and she said it was hands down her favorite yet!  That is saying a lot!
I had the Pad Prick Pao with Chicken.  It was extremely flavorful!  My mouth made me do the &#34;Mark Wiens&#34; (for those that have seen his Thailand travel/eating videos on Youtube).  I&#39;ve never tried this dish and now feel the urge to get back there and eat it again.
The ingredients are very fresh and flavorful.  The only advice I would give to those that like spicy foods is to make sure that you order it a little spicier that you normally do...they definitely are light on the spice.
They also need to add some music or something.  I felt like the other 2 tables, that came in while we were eating, were able to hear everything that each table was talking about.",04/08/15,213,5,2,5,31,6.726,2.8539999999999996,0.38999999999999996,19.756000000000004,No,2013

I feel a little silly that just now in life am I venturing out in to really trying all these new Thai dishes. Yes I am one of those people that had only had Pad Thai in the past. Well- as I travel a LOT, I often come home from trips with no groceries in my house and one day recently before a trip and just last night after getting home from a trip- this was the case. I saw all the Yelpers&#39; photos of the food and frankly - that showed me what to get. And I love that you can order no heat, a little heat a little more heat and please burn my tongue off heat. ;-) The food is OUTSTANDING. High quality and - they deliver and offer pickup of course. I basically ordered about 5 different dishes, LOL, knowing that I had no groceries and a snowstorm coming in. Color me lazy. But wow- the chicken and beef are delightful. I&#39;m not a pork fan so I didn&#39;t try any of that, but I also got some soups last time and will go for the Pho next time. Here is the bonus- the people that run the place are so sweet and caring and attentive- the first day I ordered for delivery, they called and said they were short staffed and couldn&#39;t do it. They apologized profusely and offered me a free meal- and then when I got there, they gave me a lovely iced Thai Coffee (yum)-- it&#39;s those little touches that show me -- they care about their customers and that makes a world of difference. HIGHLY recommend. I may move in here. ;-)",21/11/15,160,5,2,5,32,5.3892,4.757,0.9410000000000001,11.303999999999998,No,1459

The portions are large, the spice is great, and the service was awesome! I had the Tom Kah noodle with seafood. It was some of the best Thai food I had. The Thai tea and sticky rice with mango was great! Loved the atmosphere. I use to go to Krystal Thai a lot but I thought their portions were too small and you didn&#39;t realize get to choose how spicy you wanted a dish. Our servers asked on a scale of 1-4 how spicy we wanted our food. I found this really helpful because I always overestimate how much spice I can handle.

This place is a good option on a Saturday or Sunday morning &amp; especially in the summer when you are out early &amp; walking through downtown Barrington.  

Bread Basket is located on main street right by the antiques store.  Once we walked in it was bigger on the inside than I was expecting.  The decor &amp; booths were nice but there wasn&#39;t anything that made it seem like it was trying to be something that it wasn&#39;t.  It had a nice small town feel to it which is what I like about suburban breakfast places.  

I ordered a biscuits &amp; gravy.  It arrived in a timely manner &amp; was pretty hot just how I like it.  The gravy for the most part was tasty but I was not too impressed by the biscuits.  They were dry &amp; not that tasty.  

Overall the service was good &amp; I liked the small town feel.  The restaurant also was clean which is always a big plus.  With all of that said I would eat here I would eat here again.",06/04/15,130,4,3,5,53,4.641800000000001,2.4,0.182,14.418000000000001,No,1361
bread-basket-restaurant-barrington,Peter T.,VP5wjC-QIeKvUv6_E-laBA,4azi_i3_4gi-v8huAScUUQ,"Had a craving for corned beef today, out in the old stomping grounds of idyllic Barrington, IL. So it was off to the Bread Basket, one of the two old standbys for locals in the village. (The other being &#34;The Canteen&#34;).   Been here dozens of times, back in the day, it was a favorite of my daughter when she was coming up.

I opted for the corned beef on rye, and the waitress told me &#34;some people like it cold,&#34; to which I retorted, &#34;no, it&#39;s supposed to be warm.&#34;

End of discussion.

It was a good sandwich, lean corn beef, probably from Vienna, many restaurants in the Chicago area use that supplier, and they have a great product.

My only &#34;beef?&#34;  The restaurant uses &#34;extruded&#34; fries. That&#39;s a potato product, a slurry of  mashed potato-like batch is whipped up, and then &#34;fry-shape&#34; pieces are shoved through a mold and flash frozen. They get a certain crispness on the outside, and are smooth and soft inside.  Just not my favorite.

But!  I was there just before closing, so the waitress gave me a go-cup of coffee, gratis.  Score!",21/08/13,135,4,1,2,-12,1.5784,0.702,0.453,13.844999999999999,No,1096

Great atmosphere and feel in this place. Cozy and the murals are awesome. Food was served fast and service got the job done. Pancakes didn&#39;t wow me. They were missing something...can&#39;t put my finger on it. Potatoes were not good - didn&#39;t finish them. I prefer crispy hash browns over what they serve here. Eggs and bacon were fine. 

Overall food/ingredient quality seemed sub-par, which would force me to talk someone out of going here, unfortunately.

The food here can be good, but not always.  Decor is old, kinda medieval or maybe gothic.  I do like the large murals on the walls at the back of the place.

My last time there the waitress was grumpy and rude.  She insisted on holding an empty table that we wanted (after telling us we could sit anywhere) for a group of regulars and squished our party of three including two large men into a booth.

No one ever came for the table that she said we couldn&#39;t sit at, the restaurant was mostly empty and we didn&#39;t appreciate being treated as second class to people that weren&#39;t even there.  I thought most breakfast restaurants are first come, first served...

I generally like the place, but this one waitress is consistently bad and unpleasant and I will think twice about going back.

My mom had the spinach and feta omelet.  She really likes this as she gets it every time we go there.  She also gets the hash browns well done and rye toast.  I like this, but I am not a big feta person.

This is a great place for the basics - burgers, BLT, and similar things. But the daily specials - usually with a Greek foundation - are also worth considering. Most sandwhiches come with fries and soup at a reasonable price for a lot of food.  I especially like the fries - they have a little extra something on them that adds some crispiness and taste. If you  don&#39;t want the fries you can have fresh fruit.  

I am a big fan of the Tuna Melt sandwich on rye.  I&#39;d prefer something other than American Cheese, but that&#39;s how it comes.

There&#39;s nothing fancy about the place, but  it is good for a basic lunch, with good food at a good price.

altiro-latin-fusion-geneva,Bianca R.,IG5tQ273lB_lrMmyqK2u0g,KUy_UN41O6nnRJLQMU4Upg,"What do I say. The service was nice, and some tacos were great. Not all, and we tried quite a few. 

Negatives: 
The seating here was terrible. Way to close to others, super tight and uncomfortable. I couldn&#39;t wait to leave because I started to get cluster phobic. 

The bathroom was really nasty. It was dirty, and I kid you not when I walked in there was a hair brush on the sink. Which just disgusted me. If the bathroom appeared the way it did I wonder what other places of the restaurant looked like. 

The carnita tacos were terrible. Filled with nothing but fat, chewy chunky fat!! When we let our server aware that we weren&#39;t happy with these tacos, she replied with &#34;Well usually carnitas are fatty anyways.&#34; I don&#39;t know where she&#39;s getting her carnitas but they are NEVER fatty. Good quality carnitas if your getting them from a taqueria are never this way. So she blew both my mother in law and myself away. I&#39;m guessing she wasn&#39;t a paisa because she didn&#39;t know what she was talking about. They of course comped this off the bill, just like any other restaurant. 

Drinks here were average, they were your average mixed drinks at a bar, but made to look cute, fancy and yummy..

Have had both numerous times and they are similarly both like frontera grill in the burbs. Great food and service and LIVE the pina cocktail. A very clever concoction that transforms near the at or exactly at the end as you must not finish the drink before the infused ice cube melts and changes it into a different drink altogether. Wonderful and spicy. I recommend getting 2 and sipping both slowly then you will not be tempted to finish too much before the melting moments. Yum.

altiro-latin-fusion-geneva,Kelsey Q.,QrERrxbC6z6atN5Rz9CB2w,AxCn7x3VdXuQaCvL5nWKPg,"The food here was pretty good.  You could taste the freshness which is what this restaurant is all about.  Small portions for the $$, but that&#39;s how a lot of &#34;fresh ingredient&#34; places are.  They could probably lower their prices if they didn&#39;t have so many people &#34;working&#34; (standing around for the most part) or constantly filling our water glasses it felt like after every sip, which got a little annoying.

My biggest complaint about this place was the seating.  Very very very close together I almost felt uncomfortable talking to my boyfriend because I knew the two tables next to us could hear every word we said loud and clear.  Also, on one side of the table are normal chairs and the other side is a bench like seat that wraps around the entire restaurant, with a pillow for your back.  I got stuck at a table in the front of the restaurant with a huge window behind me that left me with no back support at all.  Not very comfortable when you want to go out on a Friday night for dinner and relax.  You kind of get the feeling they don&#39;t want you to get too comfortable so they can turn the tables over faster since the place is pretty tiny.

Over all, service was decent, food was good.  I would probably give this place another try one day but request a better table.",08/11/16,143,3,1,4,-1,3.1233000000000004,2.1710000000000003,0.7300000000000001,9.099,No,1306
altiro-latin-fusion-geneva,Amanda O.,mSSRX_XWF31iVl5oAiC1Ow,7J849-v-MP2yuMjN7dDm7g,"I really loved this tapas-style restaurant. It reminded me of all the awesome tapas places in the city that I miss. The restaurant is pretty small, so make sure you call ahead to make reservations. I noticed people that were waiting for a table were sitting in the kitchen. It is a tight squeeze.

My husband and I ordered the Al Trio guacamole to start. One regular guacamole and one mango and one watermelon. The watermelon guacamole was outstanding. Who ever would have thought to add watermelon to avocado? Such a nice surprise.

We also shared the Al Chilango steak tacos, the Al Carnitas pork belly tacos, the Al Elotito corn, and the Ala Pap Brava potatoes. All were outstanding. The potatoes were a little spicy, but they are served with a fried egg on top that really offsets the heat of the spices.

The restaurant is really small, so the tables are kinda close together, but one benefit of that is getting to see what other people ordered (without looking creepy by staring from a table from far away!). There are so many things I want to go back and try!

I ordered the Ala Pina pineapple margarita which was really good when it first came out, but the large ice cube inside was infused with chipotle spices, which made the drink hotter and spicier as you got down to the bottom. We also had the Al Naranja Agua (orange water) that is nothing like an orange juice (which I thought it would be). It was sweet yet tart at the same time (there was lime juice squeezed in too).

We finished our meal with a Strawberries &amp; Cream dessert (the special for Valentine&#39;s Day). It was served with rose petals on top, which I thought was a nice, romantic touch.

A few of the gripes I had about this place is the small size, and the fact that we visited on a cold February night - so every time the door opened, we were hit with a frigid gust of air. Brrr!

Other than that, the food here was so good that I know we&#39;ll be back! Looks like they have a nice-sized patio, so I&#39;ll be visiting when it gets a bit warmer out.",14/02/16,246,4,2,5,13,7.989300000000002,4.814000000000001,0.185,19.001,No,2035
altiro-latin-fusion-geneva,Tadd T.,huuu1f574-2IPlHsLmI2VA,p_-a9TutKthpkWA1rNA7_w,"We certainly did not enjoy the seating, which were wooden blocks that left barely any room between them and the table. This, and the incessantly screeching child accompanying a waiting family, gave us a sour first impression.

The much-needed drinks, though delicious (especially my vegetal and spicy Al Verde), were disappointingly low-proof; given Bien Trucha&#39;s similar booze level, we had to wonder if it was just a symptom of this suburb&#39;s &#34;gringo&#34; aversion to strong tequila drinks. 

Passing over the only guacamole option of a fruit-filled $10 trio, we opted for yellowfin tuna tostadas laced with a chipotle glaze and avocado cream cheese. Pretty and tasty as they were, we felt $11 warranted more than four tiny chips. And king salmon tacos with grilled pineapple and chipotle aioli failed to impress. But skirt steak tacos, full of tender meat generously dressed with an excellent tomatillo-avocado salsa, got an intriguing flavor and texture boost from crispy shoestring potatoes. And elote swathed in garlic aioli with cotija cheese bore the distinct pungency of epazote, if only a tad too much. 

Our meal overall was good but not great -- it lacked the wow factor of Bien Trucha&#39;s explosive but balanced flavors and impressive price-portion ratio. Still, we wouldn&#39;t discourage you from trying Altiro, as long as you aren&#39;t looking for a facsimile of Bien.",19/05/16,165,3,2,3,19,2.4319,1.507,0.71,7.7829999999999995,No,1398

The staff was friendly and attentive. Sometimes a bit too attentive that could make a person feel uncomfortable. The food had nice flavor combinations. We would go back if in the area again, but not go out of our way for this restaurant. The food is expensive for the portion sizes you get, but that is with most tapas places.

I love going to bien trucha when I&#39;m in town, however, due to the cold and small location we pulled around the block while my mom called to see if there was a wait. Before she even dialed, she said &#34;I have a better idea&#34;. She was right! The location is certainly kind of strange, but hey... There&#39;s PARKING!!!!! Living in Florida means I hate, hate, HATE cold walks on snowy, windy days just to get some food. Bien trucha sure has a parking issue. 
Altiro was nearly empty at 1pm on Wednesday and service was QUICK! We were promptly seated and our glasses filled with water(ok... I&#39;ll never understand the tiny water cups at these two places but whatever). We ordered drinks and an order of steak tacos. I went to the bathroom and before you know it, everything is there! It looked like everyone else had an order of chips given to them.. However we didn&#39;t get any which is a huge bummer for me. 
We tried to get a side order of rice and corn but the server informed us they don&#39;t have rice... Strange... But I did enjoy the corn! The order of beef tacos and corn left me satisfied.

After reading the yelp reviews (and a bit done with the surly service we&#39;d experienced at Bien Trucha the last few times we went there) we decided to give Altiro a try for our son&#39;s birthday. 

We sat on the patio on a Wednesday night &amp; it wasn&#39;t super busy. However, service was unbearably slow. Nice, but really, really slow. Our server forgot to put in the order of one of the guest&#39;s drinks and neglected to check back after serving everyone else, so she sat without anything long after everyone else&#39;s glasses had been drained. It was difficult to get anyone&#39;s attention, however when we did they were super nice. 

And the food was just okay. Not bad, but definitely not at the same level as Bien Trucha if you&#39;re looking for a substitution. 

We ordered the jicama guacamole, Altiro (tilapia tacos) Al Puercoriso (pork belly &amp; risotto), Al Chilango (skirt steak) Al Camaronchizo (shrimp &amp; chorizo) &amp; grilled corn side dish. Everyone seemed to like the shrimp &amp; chorizo best. The skirt steak wasn&#39;t very flavorful, pork belly was overly fatty (yes, I know it&#39;s not a lean dish but this was more than usual) and the tilapia was just okay. Again, not bad, but not anything to write home about. Sitting at a table that was too small for our party with empty drink glasses for most of the night really didn&#39;t help much, either. 

If the food was better we&#39;d be willing to give it another try, but after sampling so much, we just weren&#39;t that impressed. To be honest, I&#39;d rate Altiro somewhere closer to 2.5 stars, but when we did see our server she was really sweet and wanted to make us happy which is what landed the 3 star rating.",07/09/15,209,3,1,2,-14,1.0059999999999998,2.447,1.331,12.222,No,1783

It was perfect for an outdoor meal.  We were greeted by the cordial host who easily made it clear that he wanted to make sure we enjoyed.

We started off with an appetizer of Al Trio--three different samplers of guacamole, each was distinctive, savory, truly an appetizer.  

And then along came a Margarita--the Organica.  When you get the real thing, rarely, you can enjoy the essence of this great drink.  Rarely was upon us.  

We looked at the menu and found it all interesting.  

The portions are medium--neither large nor small.  We didn&#39;t feel the need to order more.

Partner (celebrating her postponed birthday) ordered Al Chilango--beef tacos with a &#39;frizzle&#39; of potato strings (local skirt steak with avocado sauce (nice twang with the sauce)).  Those small cubes that you find on typical tacos was there, but while the same size as at others, they were cooked to the proper doneness!  Morsels of goodness.

I had the Ala Barbacoa--lamb in cactus leaves.  As anyone knows (I really don&#39;t), cactus leaves add to the flavor of this traditional (is it traditional?) dish.  Wow!  Subtle flavors.  A true delight!

altiro-latin-fusion-geneva,Krystal C.,MvLY5flczjYVGiCKiSpevg,2-2TV9qTtxRYxv8oPxIt4g,"I recently discovered Tapas-style restaurants. Needless to say, they&#39;re now my favorite. Altiro was very small but cozy and almost lounge-like. My boyfriend took me here for Valentine&#39;s day. It was a Sunday around 5:00pm. We were seated promptly at a corner table. It was a candle-lit dinner. Very soft lighting and comfortable atmosphere. 
I ordered a flavored water (Al Limon) to start and drinks were brought out immediately. Let me just say, I LOVE the lime water. It was so refreshing, and tasted so vibrant. I would love to make this at home, for life. Our server was very nice, she introduced the menu and explained each section so we were familiar with the different categories. We started off with the Ceviche. Typically, I am not a cold fish, ceviche kind of girl. It was served on mini homemade tostadas. Totally fresh, totally delicious. I went back for seconds (there were four to an order). We ordered Mexican street-style corn as a side. Honestly, this was probably my least favorite dish of the night-only because if you&#39;re used to the traditional Elote/Corn in a cup vendor-it didn&#39;t really compare, personally.  
For our dinner order, we got the Al Fundido tacos. I could eat 12 of these I feel. They were fresh and an absolute delight. Our only gripe with these was we wish there were more than 1 shrimp per taco. Even just 1 more would&#39;ve made a difference. Either way-this dish was my boyfriend and mine&#39;s favorite. We also ordered Ala Tostada. It was shredded lamb with a chipotle sauce on a crispy tostada (same tostada as the ceviche). It came with three little tostadas and they were the cutest. The lamb was so tender. I do not like spicy food at all. It was spicy for a split second and in the next breath, it was gone. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. 
We were pretty full at this point, but then the waitress mentioned dessert. We had to. We chose the key lime pie bites. They were frozen and vibrant with lime flavor. Very good!

The Bad: Chilango steak tacos were bland, no seasoning for the steak strips. Price differences, menus on website are cheaper than what I was actually charged. Lastly, I had an order to go and they gave me no utensils or napkins. 

Overall I&#39;d like to honestly give a higher rating because the barbacoa was delicious, but the uber bland steak and price variance are hard to ignore.",09/02/16,62,3,1,0,-13,-0.8553999999999999,0.302,0.65,4.048,No,497

What a phenomenal restaurant in Geneva, perfect for a casual date night or a nice anniversary evening like ours. We started with the ravioli and potato stack, and while I don&#39;t think we could have ordered anything that didn&#39;t blow the tops off our taste buds, both were incredible. Their sauces are so flavorful and really set the dishes over the top. We continued with a few items from their tacos menu and the roasted street corn. It was so enjoyable I&#39;m afraid to eat anywhere else now! It is also the type of restaurant that you crave what you ate, so while I want to go back and try everything on the menu, I will probably just reorder all the same because I can&#39;t not!

Also, our waiter was so great and personable. I&#39;m glad he talked us into a cocktail instead of wine, because the pineapple margarita he brought me was one of the most unique and flavorful cocktails I&#39;ve ever enjoyed. It was so fresh! I even think the ice cube was made of shredded pineapple, which is something I haven&#39;t experienced before and loved it.

Wish I lived closed because I would love to go again sometimes. My boyfriend and I were in town for the weekend and stumbled upon this place on a Friday night. We took a risk not really knowing what to expect and were very very pleased. 

Everything is &#34;small plate&#34; style, and very easy to share. Also easy to order too much food, which we did haha. But it was all very good. We shared an elotes dish and a potato appetizer which were both amazing. The presentation of the potato was stunning, I&#39;ll try to add a picture later. We shared several different taco dishes...each one has 4 tacos (small ones). The one we loved the best was the steak tacos which came with an amazing tomatillo sauce which I wanted to lick out of the little bowl...obsessed. 

The servers were very friendly and helpful. 

Did not have drinks, but I&#39;d go so far as to guess that their drinks are pretty good too. It got pretty busy by the time we left, so I think we kinda lucked out and came in right before it got busy - a lot of the people coming in had reservations, so I would recommend calling ahead.",29/11/15,129,5,2,5,42,8.343,4.588,0.12,9.293,No,1123

Ordered the &#34;Street&#34; corn appetizer, which was delightful.  Also had the shrimp tacos which were fresh and very good.  Dinner for two, one app and two taco entrees came out to around $80 with tip.    This place is very much like Bien Trucha without the attitude.

This place is SO delicious with a great atmosphere... it&#39;s totally off the beaten path - oddly located in the middle of a neighborhood... however it&#39;s a hidden gem and because of that, the wait time is substantially less than at Bien Trucha.  So I say I&#39;m hesitant to submit a stellar review because I selfishly don&#39;t want everyone to know about this awesome place and have to wait an hour+ to get in (unlike Bien Trucha).  But I digress.

Ok, so the food is so delicious.  SO delicious.  Fantastic flavors. 5 stars for sure. 
The Al Salmonjillo - wow!  So many wonderful flavors - this is definitely one of my favorites.  
The Al Elotito corn side dish is delicious.
Ala Tostada - delicious, a little messy and kind of hard to eat in a pretty manner, but still super good.
The Al Trio guacomole appetizer is good too.
I wasn&#39;t as impressed with the Ala Barbacoa - it&#39;s still good but I prefer bolder flavors.
I&#39;m a nursing mommy so I haven&#39;t tried their alcoholic drinks but the Ala Jamaica is really light and refreshing and comes in a fun jar :)

Price is a little high IMO for the amount of food you get.  We leave feeling comfortable.  Not still hungry yet not stuffed.  

We&#39;ve sat outside twice and really enjoy the atmosphere, especially when they light the fire lamps.  And both times we got right in - and the restaurant was full too, inside and out.

The service is fine - and this isn&#39;t a big deal but both times we&#39;ve been there, we&#39;ve experienced several mix ups with food and drinks.  We&#39;ve been brought food and drinks at least 3 times that belonged to another table.  Once is fine and mistakes are normal... I get it.  I&#39;ve worked in the food industry too.  But more than 3 mix ups in 2 visits.... hmm... do they just not write down table numbers along with the food/drink orders?  Seems a fairly simple way to solve that problem.

I understand the owner is a former Bien Trucha employee and there are similarities-the tacos are at their base similar, but Altiro&#39;s sauces, the potato strings on top, and some flavors are different-in a good way!

The Al Puercoriso is the best example of their uniqueness-diced pork belly cooked just right in a risotto with smooth and a little cheesy (definitely not Velveeta!) and peppery sauce.   Unexpected but really great.

The guacamole trio to start was good-couldn&#39;t tell much difference, but I&#39;ll just assume my co-diners took the watermelon out of the one and the mango out of the other.

Our waiter could not remember the specials (probably because the flavors were so forgettable). The times that he graced us with his presence, he would arrive stinking of cigarette smoke and without the drinks we ordered 10 minutes prior. When we queried about the drinks, he quickly shifted blame to the bartender saying that he was new and not familiar with their cocktail list. Meanwhile, both the bartender and our waiter had plenty of time for certain guests who appeared to be a group of friends of the establishment. 

At the end of the evening, we raised our service concerns to the manager who sniped back that our waiter and his bartender were some of his best staff and that maybe we should have better familiarized ourself with their menu. Whaaaa?????",13/12/15,99,1,1,1,-1,0.5869,0.648,0.522,7.83,No,968

This weeks challenger is Altiro Latin Fusion!!!

Let&#39;s get ready toooo rummmm... Oh never mind, lets just get to the review.

First up, if it&#39;s Altiro, Bien Trucha, El Molcajete or even A Toda Madre, you will enjoy yourself. Each has their strong points. Altiro is most like Bien Trucha. Very similar menu. 

Let&#39;s break it down...

Food: 
Al Trio Guacamole- Great Guacamole, nice presentation, but the two fruit options were just overpowered by the Avocado. No real flavor wonders of the world here outside of the fact that it is great quality Guacamole.

Ala Tostada- Eh, Skip it, it reminded me of basic BBQ pork and the meat was mounded on a tiny little chip that could not really sustain that much topping. 

Al Calambre- This has the potential to be great, but it was just Killed by the guacamole tomatillo salsa! It took over, I did manage to get one faint taste of the wonderful steak underneath, but then my mouth was blown away by the Guacamole Bazooka. :-(

Al Elotito- I could eat this by the Truck load! Awesome Flavors of citrus and perfectly charred corn! This gave me the four star edge on a semi-3 star review! 

De-core:
Kinda rustic and done on a budget, but made me feel more at home in the long run. I&#39;m planning on stealing a few of their furniture ideas for my house.

Staff:
Totally and Completely Impeccable!!! Absolutely felt comfortable, taken care of and appreciated by everyone!!! Love the staff! 

(I would like to take a break to mention that the staff at Bien Trucha can be rushed, and non-personable and that is important when choosing this over that!!!! I get that that&#39;s their thing, but just saying)

Now, I am looking forward to coming back and giving a few other selections a try, I have a feeling that there are some other hidden pots of gold here. 

With a few minor modifications, the food here could be at the top my list and as a family run place, they already have my vote for Service!",15/07/14,252,4,1,5,-15,5.2383999999999995,4.242,1.0470000000000002,17.711999999999996,No,2033

The portions look small but I assure you as a person with s big appetite, you will come away satisfied.  I highly recommend the grilled corn appetizer and guacamole sampler.  My wife is not one to eat corn and she loved it.  For our main dish, we had chicken tacos and tilapia tacos. Both were spectacular.  The portions looked small but after the 2 appetizers, they were just right.

The drinks here are expensive ($9 for an average sized cocktail in s martini glass) and the drinks come slowly.  That said, the drink I had, jalapeÌ±o cucumber martini, was really good.  All the cocktails on the menu look complicated to make which is likely why the drinks come slower than I would normally expect at a restaurant.

The atmosphere is very cozy and hip. It reminded me of the store front restaurants you find nestled away in neighborhoods in Manhattan.  If dining on the weekend at dinner time or later, make s reservation.  The restaurant itself is small and there is not a lot of space to wait if your table is not ready.  Also do not expect to be able to get a cocktail while you wait for the reasons I stated earlier.

I have no desire to stand in such a line with a 13-month old toddler, so we visited Altiro for breakfast instead.

We got strawberry pancakes for the toddler, while I got the Al Chori-Huevo and my wife got an Al-Fundido.

The names don&#39;t really help you out much, so here&#39;s what they actually were.

Al Chori-Huevo: if you&#39;re reading this, you should know about the goodness of chorizo. Now put an egg on top, a spicy sauce underneath, and oh, somehow it&#39;s not greasy. It had a tomato and an avocado on it, and this was a step above your ordinary brunch item. The flavors melded just right, the texture was surprisingly smooth... good stuff.

The Al Fundido is off the lunch menu. It&#39;s shrimp, sauce and veggies on top of a thicker piece of bread. Once again, the spice was just right, the shrimp marinated just right but not overcooked.

My daughter&#39;s pancakes also got an upgrade, served with sweetened condensed milk and sprinkles. In addition the pancakes themselves had a welcome tang.

Don&#39;t miss out on the freshly-squeezed fruit juice, either - we had lemon and lime, and it worked perfectly with what we ordered.

They have a nice selection of Beers, Wines, and Mixed drinks, all very good. While I did not have a &#34;dinner&#34;, I had BEER AND CHEESE FONDUE
Cheddar and Smoked Gouda, Ale Asylum Madtown Nut
Brown Ale, Smoked Salsa Verde, House-Made Chips $8
The home made chips were excellent as was the Verde and Cheese combination. I also tasted the Calamari which was very good also. My main problem was the main course for me. For Dinner I tried COUNTYLINE GRILLED CHICKEN SALAD
Grilled Chicken Breast, Field Greens, SautÌ©ed Apples,
Gorgonzola Cheese, Candied Walnuts, Cider Vinaigrette
Dressing $14.

I don&#39;t mind paying for a GOOD dinner salad, but for $14 it better be freekin awesome. This I harken to say is a best suited for a restaurant that would offer it for $7-$9.  If I get a salad the greens must be COLD and CRISP,( I note exception to Red Leaf and a few others). This was warm and wilty, and had some greens that had turned black. The Dressing was not cold either and was way over used contributing to the lifelessness of the greens. The Walnuts and Gorgonzola  were very good and plentiful, alas, but not so with the apples with pieces so small you need a magnifier just to see it. 

The dishs I did not taste but looked good and would probably be my choice(s) if I was to try this place again. were, SHRIMP &amp; SPINACH AGLIO OLIO
Shrimp, Spinach, Olive Oil, Garlic, Tomatoes, Feta Cheese
Pine NutsÛâ$15/19  or the 
BANGERS &amp; MASH
Housemade Lincolnshire Sausages, Mashed Potatoes,

We sat down at the bar a little before 6pm so we we all ordered burgers with fries or chips. The burgers came out perfectly cooked as we had requested. Maybe it was because I had gone to Sullivan&#39;s a few weeks before and I was hoping for the same burst of amazing flavor but it just didn&#39;t compare to the burger at Sullivan&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t bad by any means but just not as good.

The bartender was really helpful and made great drinks for us. She even let us order an app off the happy hour menu even after 6pm. I really enjoyed the decor of the restaurant.

countyline-tavern-buffalo-grove,Jeff K.,tidcqPzhO8mZyNV_cW4y9A,MsOhWv4yRDjApdxS2SF3Bg,"Update:

Went back with a smaller group a few months later.  The food was good, I got the special tacos with a side salad on the side.  I&#39;m gluten free and they are sensitive about certain and other things not so much.  For instance they will not give me salad dressing because of cross contamination but other things they don&#39;t care about cross contamination.  Bottomline I do not get sick when eating there so it will be a good place to go when I&#39;m in BG.

The special tacos were really good.  I think they should just make a taco section on there menu and if they did that id go all the time as I love unique tacos.  So I upgraded my review by 2 stars 

Last review:
Went there with a party of 8 people and the service was really bad however I thought the food was pretty good.  

Here&#39;s why I gave them a generous 2 stars.
1. They are in the suburbs and expectations are low
2. It&#39;s not a chain restaurant
3. The food was upscale bar food
4. They have a gluten friendly menu

Now the service, clearly they were under staffed and as a result lunch took 2 hours, which is insane!  I had to physically get up to get water because our waiter disappeared for 20 minutes.  He was very nice person but either he sucked as a waiter or the restaurant was understaffed.

The ambiance was pretty cool, exposed brick, TV&#39;s throughout.  Would be a good place to watch a Blackhawks game.

In regards to the food, I had the smoked chicken wings which were good!  I also had the hummus and Mediterranean salad and both those were okay.  Everyone else said there food was good not great, like I said, better than bar food but not amazing. 

If the service was better, I would give them 4 stars.  I would go back if I was in the neighborhood for the wings and try some other things.  But I would not make a special trip to them.  It was okay.",25/06/16,196,4,1,5,-20,5.043600000000001,4.455,1.369,15.177,No,1852

First of all, there is a ton of seating both indoor and outside. The bar area is ample as well. Their drinks are great, I got &#34;Twisted Ballini&#34; which was amazing. They have a variety of food options. There are small plates (like appetizers) that you can just share the whole night. Or full plate meals such as salmon, &#34;the best grilled cheese ever&#34;, bangers and mash, and so on. All the food was well cooked and came out quickly. 

We had their small plates - Calamari, Chicken Wings and Chicken Tostadas. All were very yummy, mild spiceness.

There are fireplaces and large leather chairs and ottomans to relax, which we were able to do after our meal was done.  As the middle is a large horseshoe bar that is well-stocked, we got seated in one of the bright side rooms named after the nearby counties.  

There is a wide variety on the menu from appetizers and main plates along with their charcuterie.  I went with the salmon reuben which was well seasoned and on marble rye toast but they have shoestring fries which were quite inconsistent from crunchy to flabby.  A lot of places like this have multiple burgers but they are quite limited here and are not considered their standout.  The kids&#39; menu is quite strong as my friend&#39;s daughter had salmon while their son had the chicken tenders.  Service was very attentive and not intrusive.

countyline-tavern-buffalo-grove,Steve D.,RGcVLW7Ax6HzJ3wN1C_Lnw,RRev-RecAMNtAmF3RFDOuw,"Stopped in here for lunch a little while back.

The inside of this place is quite nice looking. A bar area when you first come in with some hi-top tables and then there are some side rooms of tables. Interesting  menu. All sort of different items. Cannot really call it a specific cuisine since the menu items vary all over the globe. I guess that gastro pub would be the closest description.

Ordered the fish and chips, and also their corned beef sandwich. Both were pretty good.
The fish was cooked just right and was not greasy. I do not like greasy. I did like the fish. The accompanying French fries were OK. I&#39;m not a big French fry person but they tasted pretty good to me.

Service was efficient and friendly.

Now here is what I did not like and it has an impact on how I rate. The prices.They were unnecessarily high. $17 for fish and chips?? At lunch?? I think that they are about $5 too high. Prices that are up there can affect your business as in making it or breaking it. I hope they make the necessary adjustment or they may have a hard go of it which would be a shame for such a nice looking place with an interesting menu.

We came for an early dinner with some friends around 5ish and I was surprised that their &#39;green house&#39; area overlooking the outdoors was so packed but we were able to get a nice table not in anyones way. I went on the website prior and was super excited to see their happy hour menu that was available everyday of the week. Upon sitting, I asked them about it and they said &#34;It doesn&#39;t include any cocktails and you have to sit at the bar.&#34; That&#39;s annoying. Why advertise something and say nothing online that you have to sit at the bar. And you can&#39;t even sit at a table near the bar, you have to literally sit at the bar. And if that is the case, you would think that the bar cocktails and drinks would be included. But nope, just a few appetizers and entrees. That&#39;s annoying. 

I thought the menu prices were decent a little pricier than I would have liked but the food was overall good. We started with the calamari appetizer which was tasty, a little too much cheese on some parts, but overall good. Then we got the burger to share with the french fries as well as the cajun mac and cheese. Didn&#39;t love the mac and cheese and thought $14 was a little pricy for the small portion since it was mostly noodles and not the other stuff they advertised. I did love the burger and french fries especially with their honey mustard dipping sauce. I would come back just for that. We shared that but kind of wished that I got that for my entree since I loved the fries. They get their stars just for the burger and fries. The service could have been better as I felt like I was trying to get the attention of our server a few times which shouldn&#39;t have been the case and I was annoyed with their unclear happy hour terms that I think they should edit on their website.

The space is nice, but not quite as &#34;blow me away&#34; nice as I had hoped. I would almost call it &#34;non-descript/modern&#34;. 

We started with their Cheesy Devils On Horseback appetizer (bacon-wrapped dates, essentially) and they were good.

For entrees, I had their hamburger. This was a good half-pound, greasy burger...but, as is too often the case, came with lame fries (like potato sticks). Why can&#39;t restaurants get this right? Serve good, fresh-cut fries with a good burger and you&#39;ll never disappoint. Ever.

My wife had the Shrimp &amp; Spinach Aglio Oglio and &#34;Houston, we have a problem&#34;. Some/most of the shrimp were raw. While she said the dish was good, overall, serving potentially raw shrimp is not. 

For dessert, we had the Chocolate Flan Cake. It was a big piece that came with a big dollop of whipped cream alongside. Quite good, but adding a mint leaf or strawberry slices would give it more flavor and a bit of a visual pop on the plate.

Definitely sit down for a drink before dinner! 

However, my complaint that set the tone for dinner was the extremely pushy server that kept asking if we wanted another drink, a salad, a soup, anything extra, dessert, coffee, cappuccino...

countyline-tavern-buffalo-grove,Elina S.,JSbptCz_mzQ0sQJN94wcwA,WbhemCQHdu1WO6NVCiqsag,"Okay, I came here the past weekend and had an overall okay time here. We came for an early dinner with some friends around 5ish and I was surprised that their &#39;green house&#39; area overlooking the outdoors was so packed but we were able to get a nice table not in anyones way. I went on the website prior and was super excited to see their happy hour menu that was available everyday of the week. Upon sitting, I asked them about it and they said &#34;It doesn&#39;t include any cocktails and you have to sit at the bar.&#34; That&#39;s annoying. Why advertise something and say nothing online that you have to sit at the bar. And you can&#39;t even sit at a table near the bar, you have to literally sit at the bar. And if that is the case, you would think that the bar cocktails and drinks would be included. But nope, just a few appetizers and entrees. That&#39;s annoying. 

I thought the menu prices were decent a little pricier than I would have liked but the food was overall good. We started with the calamari appetizer which was tasty, a little too much cheese on some parts, but overall good. Then we got the burger to share with the french fries as well as the cajun mac and cheese. Didn&#39;t love the mac and cheese and thought $14 was a little pricy for the small portion since it was mostly noodles and not the other stuff they advertised. I did love the burger and french fries especially with their honey mustard dipping sauce. I would come back just for that. We shared that but kind of wished that I got that for my entree since I loved the fries. They get their stars just for the burger and fries. The service could have been better as I felt like I was trying to get the attention of our server a few times which shouldn&#39;t have been the case and I was annoyed with their unclear happy hour terms that I think they should edit on their website.

I may still be back and sit at the bar bar if I&#39;m just wanting a glass of wine and a good burger.",08/02/16,203,3,2,5,42,5.0464,2.291,1.66,16.049,No,1977

The space is nice, but not quite as &#34;blow me away&#34; nice as I had hoped. I would almost call it &#34;non-descript/modern&#34;. 

We started with their Cheesy Devils On Horseback appetizer (bacon-wrapped dates, essentially) and they were good.

For entrees, I had their hamburger. This was a good half-pound, greasy burger...but, as is too often the case, came with lame fries (like potato sticks). Why can&#39;t restaurants get this right? Serve good, fresh-cut fries with a good burger and you&#39;ll never disappoint. Ever.

My wife had the Shrimp &amp; Spinach Aglio Oglio and &#34;Houston, we have a problem&#34;. Some/most of the shrimp were raw. While she said the dish was good, overall, serving potentially raw shrimp is not. 

For dessert, we had the Chocolate Flan Cake. It was a big piece that came with a big dollop of whipped cream alongside. Quite good, but adding a mint leaf or strawberry slices would give it more flavor and a bit of a visual pop on the plate.

They have an interesting beer menu, too.

We&#39;re willing to overlook the shrimp &#34;issue&#34; and return to try other dishes.",07/12/15,160,3,1,3,9,2.6008,1.841,0.382,14.778,No,1312

There is no better restaurant in town, and I say this with strong credibility as I have been in the industry for years.  This place has a solid menu with unique options and FINALLY an eatery in these burbs with charcuterie!  I would&#39;ve been satisfied with just that but we continued to order food for over 3 hours and there were only empty plates at the end of the night.

The drink list is extensive and their craft beer options are actually interesting and well chosen.  When I go to restaurants and the only &#34;craft beers&#34; listed are from Lagunitas or Goose Island, I am vastly unimpressed.  County Line had a wealth of options from local and non-local alike along with descriptions and even Ratebeer scores where applicable.  Well done!

I am so happy this is no longer the same old blah blah boring &#34;if it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it&#34; establishment.  Prices are reasonable for the quality and the decor is warm and inviting.  For the people who think this place was over priced I would say you are probably more accustomed to eating at chain restaurants with $14.99 3-4 course meal specials - and with Outback being right next door, you should keep going there and stay out of my way.  For four people who had 12 drinks, 3 apps, 4 entrees and 2 desserts $238 + tip was a steal!  Especially for the quality and quantity.  My only negative critiques would be the following:

1) The staff needs to explain the different offerings on the charcuterie, cheese, and smoked fish boards.  Coming from that sort of background it was easy for me to decipher what was in front of me but most people would be at a loss.  BTW, the Bourbon Cherry Duck Terrine was awesome!

2) The staff should be better educated about basic restaurant information, i.e. when i asked about the hours of operation, our server had to go and ask someone.  That&#39;s 101 stuff.

Other than that I was pleased with our experience and I will definitely be back.  It was also nice to see at least 3 different tables filled with people I knew.

The reason I use the quotes is because that&#39;s what it&#39;s called but it is definitely not the best damn grilled cheese I have ever had. They used cold tomatoes which made the cheese not melt and it was very watery and cold. The bacon was overcooked and hard. The next thing ordered was the Ale burger. The friend that had that said it was very good. We did all order French onion soup and that was very delicious. Their drink menu is great and I suggest going to Countyline Tavern just for the drinks.  Their beer selection is great and their cocktail menu is very good and sophisticated.",25/10/15,104,3,1,5,-13,4.1598,2.22,0.641,11.137999999999998,No,1027
countyline-tavern-buffalo-grove,Kelly G.,mn28MrXYoGhnSYMKMA54hw,gP4cubrvJ0T40eP155ff_g,"Went here for lunch today and had a few things from the &#34;small plates&#34; menu.  I felt that the prices were still kind of high for a small plate.  We ordered the polenta fries, chicken skewers, and the fried chicken tostada.  We loved the polenta fries definitely the favorite - I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the &#34;sauce&#34; it should have said Harissa aioli  not sauce IMO - I could taste the mayo and I am just not a big mayo fan.  The chicken skewers were good, I liked the sauce it was just weird to have skin on the chicken for a skewer so it tasted fatty and I was looking for something lighter, my mom didn&#39;t like the sauce it came in.  The tostada, the fried chicken is in a beer batter and when I looked at it I thought it was fish and after tasting it I think it should have been. All the accompaniments tasted like fish tacos.  On the menu it says that there is avocado on it - it is more of a guacamole there were tomatoes and onions mixed with the avocado - I asked for the pico de gallo on the side because I don&#39;t like raw tomato and onion so I had to scrape the &#34;guacamole&#34; off, easier said then done.  The tostada part was really soggy in the middle and I am not sure if that was from the guac or it was sitting a bit, the skewers were taking longer then the rest of it so the waiter came out to ask if we wanted to wait for them to be done, we declined just said bring it out when ready.  The pico that I asked for on the side ended up just being chopped up tomatoes so not sure what happened there.  Overall it was decent my biggest critique would be to cut the portion sizes in half along with the prices for them and I would have been much happier.  Not sure if I will be back due to the pricing.  I typically like to stay under $10 per plate for my meals and there were only one or two things that were under that but not something that I would order.",13/11/15,182,3,2,2,43,1.7671,0.901,0.637,11.462,No,1896
countyline-tavern-buffalo-grove,Ashley P.,tcuV5SPKxKghmTp9B_MZYQ,iuPtnLoqUQHd-P04ziKMCw,"I contemplated writing a review, as mine is based on the restaurant&#39;s first day of business, so I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect.  But, I&#39;ll go for it anyway...
     The building is beautifully decorated, both inside and out.  The parking lot is accessible just north of Lake Cook Rd., with the entrance away from the main drag in hopes to avoid any traffic congestion along an already-busy road.
     Other than the attractive entrance just inside the doors, the rooms of the restaurant haven&#39;t changed much from the previous restaurant that was there.  We were put in the semi-private room to the right, so we could watch the Cubs playoff game (game 3) on the flatscreen (the restaurant isn&#39;t intended to be a sports bar, but we noticed a few TVs and a lot of guests watching right along with us).
     We started with a few appetizers for our group of 11- TAVERN NACHOS (a small order of potato chips topped with melted cheese, scallions and a few small bits of bacon), SMOKED CHICKEN WINGS (approx. 10 wings coated in a chipotle honey glaze) and CHEESY DEVILS ON HORSEBACK (a small order of Medjool dates stuffed w/ Gorgonzola cheese and wrapped in bacon).  The &#34;nachos&#34; were good, but the cheese was really the only topping present, the wings were just okay, but not worth the $12 price tag, and the dates were surprisingly tasty.
     The restaurant has a large selection of craft beers, wine, and other alcoholic beverages.  The soda is limited to a couple of standards (Coke, Diet Coke and one other), but you can get some of Sprecher&#39;s sodas (Root Beer, Cream Soda, etc.) in bottles.
     For meals, most of our party chose to split entrees/sandwiches so we could all taste a variety of dishes.  We had: the CAESAR SALAD with GRILLED CHICKEN, the CAJUN MACARONI &amp; CHEESE, the SHORT RIB &amp; WILD MUSHROOM STROGANOFF, the CHICKEN POT PIE, the BANGERS &amp; MASH, the BIG ALE PRIME BURGER, the BEST DAMN GRILLED CHEESE EVER, the PORK BELLY BLT, and the KIDS PENNE PASTA and KIDS CHICKEN STRIPS.  I&#39;ll comment on only the dishes I tried or those sitting near me tried and commented on.  The Caesar salad was &#34;delicious&#34;, the Mac &amp; Cheese was very good and not overly spicy (we ordered the smaller of the two sizes and still had plenty to share), the Pork Belly BLT was dry and of the four of us who tried it, no one was a fan.  The pretzel bun it was served on was good, but the sandwich itself didn&#39;t have much taste and wasn&#39;t something I&#39;d order again.  The prime burger was, unfortunately, cooked wrong twice (it was overcooked the first time and never served to us, then was remade and came out quite undercooked- our order was for Medium Well).  Only two bites were taken out of that $15 burger.  The Grilled Cheese sandwich should have been good and I have high hopes for that one.  It was extremely spicy with a large jalapeno and spicy sauces (eventually, I had to remove the rest of the pepper, as my lips and mouth were burning a bit too much).  Unfortunately, the cheeses weren&#39;t melted, so the sandwich looked like a slice of bread with two only-warm slices of cheese and the pepper and sauce.  I would love to see the restaurant perfect that sandwich and serve it with melted cheese, the way a great grilled cheese sandwich is served!
     A few people in our party tried dessert; the kids&#39; meals were to be served with an &#34;ice cream treat&#34;, which was a scoop of some sort of berry sorbet.  Neither of the kids liked the taste of it, but their parents did!  The SEASONAL NY STYLE CHEESECAKE was &#34;good&#34;, I&#39;m told (but I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s such thing as bad cheesecake anyway!).
     Overall, I think I could become a fan of this restaurant, and I&#39;m hoping to give it a try once it&#39;s been open for some time and gets any kinks out.",13/10/15,454,3,3,4,77,3.9825,2.312,1.037,22.651,No,3854

Well, since you asked.... the answer is: &#34;Italian beef.&#34;

Personally, I am not the world&#39;s biggest Italian beef fan, but my husband probably is. Nearly every time we come back to Chicagoland, we order some Italian beef from Portillo&#39;s to bring back with us. You can call ahead (at least 24 hours, I think?) and order several pounds of beef, which comes with gravy and peppers (if desired). The bread can be included, too. It&#39;s the perfect arrangement for us to bring a cooler and fill it with frozen beef instead of shipping it out (expensive) or missing out completely.

Occasionally, we eat here too -- just to get our fix of beef and hot dogs. There&#39;s nothing like this in Kentucky at all. The beef is pretty darn tasty. Juicy hot dogs, delicious fries, gut-busting beef sandwiches, so good.

I should of known from the moment of walking in and seeing it practically empty and food on the floor and not one single person working on cleaning any part of the place that it was not going to be a good experience. After ordering my food i moved to standing to the pick up line where me and my co-worker started talking to another person who was waiting for their order. She mentioned that she had ordered through the drive thru but her order came incomplete and she was waiting for it to be fixed. Finally after some time a manager came with her food to the counter and started questioning her about who brought her the incomplete order and what was missing from it. The manager was very rude in the way he spoke to her, making it seem as though he was blaming the customer for the order being wrong and not apologizing at all. The manager was roughly opening each bag of her order and even put his hand in and was touching her food. Me and my coworker couldnt believe how he was speaking to them and acting. As the lady took her food and walked by us she shaking her head and said she couldnt believe it. As she walked by us the manager rudely said &#34;dont listen to her!&#34; And then he walked away. Of course the lady heard him and turned around to confront him. He ran to a back room like a coward and she ended up speaking to another manager who simple shook his head and shrugged. All this is going on while im waiting for my food. My coworker notices the young employees behind the counter are roughly throwing bags of food around and she asked a young girl working if that was normal, she replied &#34;no, they are just being funny&#34;. Fun throwing paying customers food around? Wow. finally after waiting over ten minutes for a hotdog and onion rings i finally got my order which was cold and looked like a mess. I didnt even bother to say anything to a manger cause clearly it wouldnt have made a difference. I through the food out, wasting $8. And not to mention after being in the place for over 15mins now, that food on the floor that was there when we walked in was still there and no one around cleaning.

portillos-hot-dogs-streamwood,Steven W.,filR0kQf8cNJGkLP7tCBFg,z4bcRHgyx_jSYF-_zEDLlA,"Portillo&#39;s is a local restaurant chain. There&#39;s a couple of chicago locations but the best ones are in the suburbs. Such as this one.
The decor successfully aims for a 1950&#39;s feel, vinyl booths etc. 
There are usually lines for both dine in and drive thru as this place is really really popular. In my opinion the lines are worse in the drive thru during weekend peak dining times, but the difference can be slight.
The ordering is done at a counter and there is no real waiter service. When your order is ready they call it out and you bring it to your table. Alcohol is ordered at a separate window, and the choices are very basic. This is not a place for drinking.
Nothing is really poor here but the strongest menu item are the  polish, the Chicago style, and the Italian beef. the beef comes wit or without cheese and peperoncini. Be careful with the peperoncini  as a little adds wonderful flavor, but too much will overpower the sandwich. It&#39;s difficult to find a better Italian beef anywhere. The onion rings are crisp, and the shakes are cold and oh so sweet. Alas the fries are just average, but the rest of the menu more then makes up for it.",21/06/15,126,5,1,4,2,3.2125,1.8110000000000002,0.5469999999999999,13.641,No,1169

Portillo&#39;s is a Chicagoland classic for a reason. Their food is flat-out fantastic every time, no matter the location. My top five faves:

1) Charbroiled cheeseburger! It might be sacrilege to favor the burgers over the dogs, but my-oh-my, what a burger it is! Charbroiled to juicy perfection, topped with fresh lettuce, onion, tomato and pickle, I can always count on Portillos to deliver.
2) French fries!! They do it right every time. Hot and crispy with just the right amount of salt, I never pass on the fries.
3) Of course, the dogs! Portillos was built on great hot dogs and they continue to deliver one of the best Chicago dogs around. Chain-restaurant or not, their dogs easily compete with the most famous names in Chicagoland.
4) ummmm ... the first three items are so good, in the 15 years I&#39;ve been visiting Portillos, I&#39;ve never actually ordered anything else. I am covered in shame.

I try to seek out a good joint for the beef between the buns so he can get his fix! I did a scan of the Yelp app and found this joint. What I didn&#39;t notice is that it was on a golf course! The boy has worked at his fair share of restaurants at golf courses lol! It&#39;s ok, we stayed anyway!

We got crazy and ordered 2 starters this time! What the what?!

We got the Flatbread de jour - Apple, bacon, pine nut, honey and goat cheese - for me obviously, cuz what guy&#39;s guy would eat that?! It wasn&#39;t half bad and the boy actually ate it lol! It could have been a little better prepared though. Everything just kept falling off the flatbread and it wasn&#39;t too warm when it came out. Maybe find a way to spread the goat cheese on the bread instead of dollops and then put the ingredients on the spread so they&#39;ll stick better.

Fried cheese curds... Who can say no to WI&#39;s pride and joy?! These were just ok. They reminded me of some frozen curds that didn&#39;t have much life. WI would have been disappointed...

I opted for the Bourbon Burger which is topped with gouda cheese, grilled onions, and bourbon sauce. Now this started making this better! I really liked the flavor of the bourbon sauce and it paired nicely with the sweetness of the onions and the gouda which I switched out. I had the Fried Polenta as my side. It was ok. It didn&#39;t have a lot of seasoning and was on the bland side.

The boy built his own Burger with Duck Bacon and White Cheddar. He was a little disappointed with the quality of the bacon. We&#39;ve had much better duck bacon and to pay $4.50 for it, it better be really good! Well, we know better now... The boy had the mac and cheese as his side. It was ok. It didn&#39;t have much seasoning and was a little on the bland side.

So delicious with an amazing sauce and it came with the best homemade polenta I&#39;ve ever had along with perfectly roasted seasonal veggies. The Hubs had the Grumpy Cuban and while he thought it could have used more mustard (I can see why they held back on that aspect since not everyone is a big mustard fan, plus it&#39;s something you can easily ask for and add yourself) he said it was quite tasty.

The place was pretty empty while parking is quite plentiful in this strip mall location.  The young man taking our order was helpful with some recommendations as well as popular choices.

My wife and I both chose combos so we could try the pupusas and pasteles.  I had the traditional pupusa and veggie pastele along with their casamiento of rice and beans with a little bit of melted cheese on top.  My wife got the jalapeno pupusa and chorizo pastele.  It came out pretty fast while it typically takes a while at other places.  The pasteles were quite fried and greasy.  The pupusas were a little on the small side.  The pork was more minced than shredded.  The curtido was not as pickled as I liked as it was still quite firm.  Their salsas were pretty standard but their homemade tomato one was quite tasty.  Since we have been to other pupusa restaurants, I will find it difficult to come back here for regular visits but I would recommend to try it out if you haven&#39;t had it before.",12/07/16,110,3,3,4,61,3.5124000000000004,1.505,0.15000000000000002,11.344999999999999,No,1093
pupusita-express-lake-zurich-2,Aaron Jae M.,S1UItV1zyR737MFpYIjrgA,zzI8bOZ5nzOODNtOw5rmCg,"I had heard a lot of good things about this place from coworkers and since it&#39;s a short drive away I decided to finally try it. I had to sample everything on the menu so I could get a good feel for the place so I ordered a pork tamale, steak torta, traditional pupusa, and a loroco pupusa.
While we were waiting for our food a server brought us out some multi colored tortilla chips, salsa, and a pickled cabbage+carrots+jalapenos slaw. Combine all those three together and you have a very tasty complimentary appetizer. I seriously couldn&#39;t get enough of the pickled cabbage. It is akin to the pickled carrots and jalapenos and cauliflower you see at a lot of Mexican restaurants.
After a little snacking our food came and it was accompanied by two more salsas and a tomato based sauce for the pupusas. I immediately became a sauce based chef and started mixing and trying everything on the tamale and pupusas. Different salsas, different mixes of salsas, and different mixes of the slaw and salsas. There was not bad combination, everything worked.
The tamale came in a large banana leaf unlike the mexican tamale which comes in a corn husk. The tamale was also a little bit larger than the standard mexican tamale. The taste was quite similar except there was just more ingredients and different sauces accompanying it. All around a great tamale. My only issue with it was the price ($3.25). Nothing crazy but I can get mexican tamales for a dollar and three mexican tamales definitely outweigh that tamale.
The pupusas I was very excited to try since I had never had them before which is somewhat of a rarity for me as I love to try new food and seek it out. The best way I can describe it is like a smaller thicker stuffed quesadilla but definitely better. I think the dough is formed around the ingredients (typically cheese and then a meat or veggie) and then pressed flat and grilled to tasty perfection. Both pupusas were tasty, to be honest I enjoyed them both and don&#39;t even remember which one was which or if there was a favorite.
The torta was the last and final part of the meal. I bet you are thinking: &#34;how can one person eat so much?!&#34; Well I had help, everything was split with another person. I decided to load up the torta with the pickled cabbage and it was definitely the right choice. It added a lot of crunch to the sandwich. The steak torta was good but nothing really separated it from a torta at another good Hispanic restaurant (except their unique slaw which I added).

I WILL definitely return for more pupusas and try some of the other items on their menu.",09/06/16,286,4,3,5,58,9.2468,4.148999999999999,0.195,22.656,No,2607

What we found was &#34;Pupusita Express&#34; in Lake Zurich.  It looked good on Yelp 4 1/2 stars.  We took a chance and drove 20 minutes to get there.  Pupusita is a Salvadorian restaurant.  They close at 8 pm on Saturday so we called first to make sure they would take us after driving there.  They were very gracious and took us even though we go there at about 7:40.  

I went there with my wife and sister.  My wife and I ordered the Tortilla Soup.  This was more broth with vegetables unlike the Mexican tortilla soup which is more of a bean based soup w/crispy tortillas in the soup.  It was just ok.  We also ordered Pupusa which was unlike anything I ever ate before. The Pupusa was like a 4&#34; tortilla frisbee filled with pork and cheese.  It was kind of different, but nothing to write home about.  My sister ordered the empanada deep fried with pork.  This was pretty good, but my favorite dish was the tamale wrapped in banana leaves.

We we&#39;re starving while driving on the road. We had just left a party that lacked food and needed a meal before we all passed out. I broke out the Yelp app and this place appeared. At first I thought it was Mexican food but then quickly noticed it was Honduran food. I thought that this would be a great culinary experience to try something new. 

We were starving and after looking at the menu nothing was really familiar to us so we went with a staple of tortilla chips and guacamole. We needed food ASAP. I really loved the flavor of the guac and the chips were very tasty. They also refilled our chips at no extra charge which I thought was really nice. Sometimes when a place charges for chips they don&#39;t do free refills. 

My little one is a huge soup fan and never says no to a fresh bowl. She ordered the Smokey Tortilla Chicken Soup made with fresh tomatoes, garlic, onions and chicken with chipotle peppers, cheddar and tortilla strips.  She absolutely loved it. I was able to sneak a spoon and it was really yummy. 

My wife ordered a vegetarian squash and Cheese Pupusas. The pupusas was like a crepe or quesadilla filled with veggies. It was very different from anything we have ever eaten in a restaurant. It also came with a mason jar of Spicy Fermented Cabbage &amp; jalapeÌ±o salsa. This jar was the bomb. I honestly could have grabbed a fork and eaten the whole jar at the table. My wife even said, &#34;We need to learn how to make this!&#34; Our food runner told us that we are suppose to eat the cabbage with the pupusas. But why stop there? It was so good I added it to my chips and salsa and even my sandwich. 

I went with the ribeye sandwich with grilled onions, peppers, lettuce &amp; tomato with a side of fried potatoes. The potatoes were really good but my little one seemed to claim them so I handed them off. The sandwich was okay. I love ribeye because it is a flavor rich cut of meat. The cut of steak was very thin and then over cooked. I am not a fan of killing my cow twice. This sandwich is similar to a torta. I added the salsa and the spicy fermented cabbage on the sandwich in order for it to taste better. The fermented cabbage is money here and can fix anything. In fact, I am hypnotized by its taste. 

This place was exactly what we needed...food. Everything was cooked fresh to order. There was a counter to order food at, then a food runner would bring your dishes as they were ready. I typically don&#39;t have a problem with that in a fast casual environment. Our food runner was also really nice answering all of our stupid questions about Honduran food. There were also other people dinning which is always a great sign. The Mexican restaurant a few doors down was completely empty which shows me that we picked the right place in the strip mall to eat at. 

I am glad that we were able to experience new authentic food. Would we drive here just to eat? Probably not considering it is an hour away from our house. But if I was in the area I would definitely come back for the spicy fermented cabbage. Yeah it was that good. This place has a great following with happy customers.

I had Pupusita Express in Lake Zurich bookmarked for months, but LZ is much farther north than my usual stomping grounds.

So it was kind of like the heavens opened up when Jacqueline announced a Yelp event nearby.  Pupusita Express, here I come!

The inside is small, a little cramped, but comfortable enough for casual dining.  Bachata music plays overhead.  We both ordered an assortment of pupusas, but the Pork &amp; Cheese was by far the best one, so you have to try it!  A pupusa is sort of like a hybrid of a pita and quesadilla.

The elote tamale was also good.  I&#39;ve had elotes, and I&#39;ve had tamales, so the combination sounded good.  There wasn&#39;t any &#34;filling&#34; in the tamale though; the tamale was a dense masa with a sweet corn flavor and served with a side of sweet, almost cheesy sauce. 

If El Salvadorean/Latin food isn&#39;t your thing, there&#39;s a surprising menu of sandwiches and wraps.  I don&#39;t know if the American menu is any good, but it might be a nice option if you have picky eaters as company.

We had a filling meal, with a variety of food, and it was very inexpensive.

The service is fine.  The lady behind the counter, and the man who delivered the food to our table, were courteous.  Some reviews noted poor service, but I had no issues.

Place looked clean except for one dirty table (and we were the only ones in there, so it wasn&#39;t like they were too busy to be wiping tables) and there were some leftover tortilla chip crumbs on the bench I was sitting on, so they should be cleaning the seats, too. 

Had the pork papusa (the pork is ground to a paste consistency, which at first seemed weird to me, but after Googling it, this is how papusas are traditionally made) with their amazing pickled spicy cabbage (curtido) on top. Also had a chicken tamale which was pretty good; nothing outstanding. The little side of rice and beans was good. They brought us a basket of tortilla chips and salsa - both were very yummy.

My friend and I were looking for something different for lunch in the LZ area and as this got good reviews we decided to give it a go.  Neither of us had had Central American food before and had no idea what the heck a Pupusita was!  

The super sweet girl at the counter was so helpful and patient explaining the different menu items that we were unfamiliar with.  

We ended trying a sampling of items-- the traditional Pupusita, which is masa stuffed with pork and cheese, flattened and pan grilled (ok, more like pan fried!)...simply delicious!  

The spicy chicken tamale is to die for...not your often found dried up tamale in a corn husk but instead rolled in banana leaves and very moist with just the right amount of heat, not overkill.

The salsa is fresh and DELICIOUS!  I could drink the stuff.  The bean and rice mix was really well seasoned and although I&#39;m not a great fan of beans I happily finished my generous serving.  

My friend tried the tortilla crusted tilapia and she said it was done perfectly-- nice crunch on the outside with the fish still moist inside.

The prices are very reasonable (for $6 or $7 you can get a combo and go away very full), the food is fresh and well prepared.  The restaurant itself is not fancy but it&#39;s kept very clean.

This is a must-have on your list of Passover-friendly restaurants. I ate here almost every night during Pesach, last year. But other than that, the fact that the menu is primarily gluten-free is amazing for people with wheat allergies, like me. The fact that it&#39;s gluten-free and delicious is awe-striking. The fact that it&#39;s gluten-free, delicious, AND affordable is like... the best thing ever. It&#39;s like if Dr. Who and Harry Potter had a crossover book series with cameos from Patrick Stewart and Benedict Cumberbatch... with commentary in the margins from Tom Hiddleston. 

They have this hot corn drink that&#39;s like drinking a unicorn&#39;s tears. That&#39;s how majestic it is. It&#39;s life-changing, ground-breaking, earth-shattering. To say the least, it&#39;s good. 

The pasteles (cornmeal empanatas) are made to order, cooked to perfection, and are so gratifyingly-satisfying for one&#39;s palate, that I have literally (and when I say &#34;literally,&#34; I mean &#34;literally&#34; and not &#34;figuratively&#34;)  had dreams about them. Ough, and don&#39;t get me started about their special hot sauce for those of us who like to feel as if we&#39;re being kicked in the mouth with steel-toed boots when we eat spicy food.

The only downside to Pupusita Express is that when I&#39;m there, I don&#39;t see enough people around to make me believe they&#39;ll be in business for much longer.

For $6 you can get a pair of pupusas with beans and rice (casamiento) and melted shredded cheese on top, and side of a unique pepper slaw.  Have tried the pork &amp; cheese (chicharron), jalapeno (rajas), and loroco (which is an edible vine that tasted like broccoli florets and squash).  The rajas had a nice little kick to them and the loroco had a unique flavor to it.  For a few extra bucks you can try a beef or chicken pastal which was basically an empanada but seemed a tad heavy on the frying grease.

Also tried the &#39;horchata de morro&#39; which was like a nuttier, heavier version of Mexican horchata with a pretty good unsweetened chocolate bite to it.  Oh yeah, the salsa that came with the chips appetizer was really good as well.

Everything was nice and clean and the gentleman who took care of me was friendly and helpful.  I had the pork pupusa and the chicken tortilla soup.  Both were very good.   I had never eaten a pupusa before, so he explained how to dress it up with the tomato sauce and pickled slaw.  Loved the pickled slaw, which had nice big jalapeno slices in it.  Definitely recommend this place.",03/04/15,48,5,2,4,22,3.8792999999999997,2.958,0.0,5.042,No,439
pupusita-express-lake-zurich-2,Cathy G.,k1dzxG8pmDohu6QBmCMf2A,63IWtAr_cuvtpe9M5whizQ,"I found Pupusita&#39;s quite by accident on Yelp.   It is hidden in the back end of a strip mall behind Luke&#39;s.   The reviews here were fantastic,  so I decided to give it a try.  I had never even heard of a pupusa but what the heck.

I kind of chuckled at their menu at first because they must have felt compelled to present &#34;American&#34; offerings such as Cobb Salads,  chicken wings and chicken tenders along with the authentic Central American pupusas and pasteles.  OK, so I orderted the wings since they were offered.  Well I wasn&#39;t chuckling after tasting them, they were actually fantastic.  And the Yelp picture of their Cobb Salad looks amazing, I&#39;m going to have to try that too.

But the real reason to come here is the pupusas and (especially IMO) pasteles.  People really seem to like the tamales, but I can&#39;t comment on those since I am just not really a tamale fan.  The dinner comes with two mix and match of any of the above mentioned items with delicious homemade beans and rice and a vinegary slaw that complements the heaviness of the other food very well.  Everything is made to order, so your take-out order will not be speedy (unless you call in advance), but it will be delicious.

One thing I tried that I really didn&#39;t care for (and this actually really surprised me) was the guacamole.  I expected it to be first rate, but it wasn&#39;t good at all IMO.  I don&#39;t know if they don&#39;t sell that much, but it seemed like they saturated the avocado with vinegar or something acidic perhaps to keep it green.  I don&#39;t know, but it was reminiscent of supermarket guac which is not on my list of fave foods.  I won&#39;t take away a star, though, I just won&#39;t personally order it again.

Mmmm, I am stuck at home right now but I would stuff myself with their food right now if I had the chance.",08/04/13,197,5,3,4,65,3.9786,2.209,1.044,14.747000000000002,No,1855

pupusita-express-lake-zurich-2,Jaclyn L.,Aw1aJkjM8u8bVCcH9-LIQA,R_oLVDfcO1uWcDKp1rbk_Q,"This place is a hidden gem which might be overlooked due to it&#39;s location and lack of knowledge of what the food they served was. Is it Mexican, is it a smoothie bar, or a Greek restaurant?  I saw the place open a few months ago and wasn&#39;t too sure about the name or what I was getting myself into.  I&#39;m glad I finally took the dive and tried out this place.  

I enjoyed the pupusita dinner and tamales very much.  It&#39;s a corn flat bread with your choice of two ingredients loaded on the inside.  The entree comes with tasty black beans topped with cheese, and a unique jalapeno coleslaw mix on the side.  There was a choice to substitute one of the two pupusita&#39;s for a tamale or other item on the menu.   I chose the cheese and jalapeno pupusita and tamale.  I was very surprised how tasty and loaded with flavor this little flat bread was;  I&#39;d like to compare it to a quesadilla, but the shell is made of corn.

Everything was made fresh to order, so it certainly takes a few minutes for everything to be cooked and ready to go. It felt more like a proper restaurant than a fast food chain in this way.  I wouldn&#39;t take my date here to sit and eat, but it&#39;s certainly something I&#39;d bring home to the family or to the boss in the hopes of a promotion for thinking outside of the box.  

Overall I felt the food was much lighter and tasted much fresher than other similar cuisine.  Maybe a bit more authentic in that they use jalapenos in a lot of their dishes and the overall spice level is a bit higher than other central american themed restaurants in the area.

Do yourself a favor and try the place out!",23/11/12,171,5,1,4,1,3.1289,1.622,0.228,14.149999999999999,No,1647

this place is located in a Plaza by KD market and other polish business such as polish credit union etc. 

upon entry place was busy so we sat at the bar, bar area it goes all the way around, staff is supper friendly and atmosphere is very inviting. 

Note that this place is authentic polish so you will hear lots of Polish speaking, no worries they speak English too. staff is super nice.

place is very clean, nice bar with TV to watch sports. 

so, we sat the girl too our orders, and food came at reasonable time. we had soup of the day which was delicious. everything we had was very hommie tasty, we&#39;ll presented and homemade.

we also had some drinks which you get a REAL drink for this price. nice and strong. 

place is super clean, restroom is super clean, only one for everyone UNISEX.

I frequent this well-kept strip mall often as Tribalance Yoga is just a few stores down. Like many other shops in this strip mall, Bacowka fairly bland exterior pales in comparison to what I found inside! 

When you step inside, you&#39;ll find a cozy spot with tons of light wood, a very long bar and a decent number of tables. There are three large flatscreens over the bar, too. I met a girlfriend of mine for dinner and while I sunk into my upholstered chair (I felt even shorter than my fun-sized stature), the table was spacious and comfortable. Our server was helpful and direct, and popped in our drink order (wine list is limited, they have a full bar, and a decent beer list) while we waited for our pierogi appetizer. 

The pierogis were nicely textured with bacon bits on top. I preferred the cheese to the meat, but that&#39;s pretty standard for me anyway! Next time I&#39;ll ask for sour cream on the side to add a little something extra to lovely little dumplings. For my meal, I went with the recommended goulash on potato pancakes - a hangover&#39;s dream, IMO.

My fiancÌ©e and I visited this place a few weeks ago (sorry it took this long to post, but it takes time to write long reviews) and it was amazing. Please read below...

1. From the outside...it might not seem that nice. It looks like it is a small restaurant in some plaza. However once you walk inside the &#34;wow&#34; factor jumps up. It actually is bigger then what you think from the outside. They remodeled it and it extends into another space. It&#39;s super clean and it looks like you walked into a trendy new cabin.

2. This is your stereotypical Chicagoland Polish restaurant. The second you walk in they speak Polish to you. That&#39;s awesome. Just say hello in English and they will speak English to you. 

3. The food is AMAZING and it&#39;s inexpensive. Pierogies, kielbasa, guompki. They got it. 

4. Sports bar is huge and fantastic. Several T.V.&#39;s

I wish we had tried this place sooner!  You will be greeted in Polish but just start speaking English &amp; they&#39;ll change over. The menu lists items in Polish but the descriptions are in English so you&#39;ll know what you are ordering.

This is not fast food. Yes, it&#39;s a Polish bar &amp; restaurant but the food is quite elevated from your typical bar food. Do not expect your food to arrive in 5 minutes. You will wait 20 minutes and, by golly, you will be rewarded for your patience.  We decided to share 2 items.  The Moskole, which is described as, &#34;Traditional Highlander Pancake&#34; (insert us doing a &#34;HIGHLANDER&#34; impression) does not do it justice.  It was 3 of what I&#39;m guessing were wheat pancakes, served with &#34;Highlander&#34; cheese (imo sheep&#39;s milk cheese like a ricotta/cream cheese texture with garlic - scrumptious!), cooked cabbage perfectly seasoned w/smoked paprika and some dill-sour cream on the side.  This dish is one of THE best dishes I have ever had at a restaurant. Wowsers.

The second dish we shared was the Kotlet Baca which is a breaded &amp; fried Pork Cutlet topped with mushrooms, cheese, green onions &amp; fried eggs alongside potatoes &amp; various salads. The cutlet was fried just right, not too greasy. The eggs on top were medium sunny-side up &amp; we would have preferred the yolks be runny but never having the dish before we didn&#39;t know what to expect. The potatoes were perfectly sliced &amp; cooked; just the right amount of crispy on the edges. The side salads were an assortment of coleslaw (somewhat bland), pickled cabbage, pickled beets, and dill/sour cream cucumbers - yum! Be aware they don&#39;t offer free refills on soda but they only charge $1.50 for it &amp; since most places charge double that or more for soda we didn&#39;t mind so much. 

The food took about 20 minutes to come out, but I would expect that based on the menu. Since the location is a popular bar some people may expect faster food, but that is not the case with a better menu such as theirs. It did take a while for the server to take our order and then quite a bit of time to get our check so the speed of the service, outside of the food prep itself, is my only negative.

While soup did come out soon, the wait for entrees was extremely long, an hour per the clock. We ordered breaded pork chops that should have come with side salads which they didn&#39;t bring out until we inquired about.

The pork chops came with fried potatoes, and both items were so extremely dry and fried, as it they had fried them in old oil. I&#39;ve had my fair share of Polish breaded pork chops and these were by far worst. Basically unedible except for maybe the fourth I ate because I was hungry.

We let them know, and servers were really nice and offered to get us something else, but at that point we were full enough and not feelin like eating more of such food.

If this is your first time eating Polish food, then maybe you will enjoy it. However, I&#39;m surprised at how many Polish people came here for food, especially when it is not fresh at all. I came in with 4 other people for some Sunday dinner. The place is pretty small and it was packed. 

From what we ordered, the kompot, rosol, and zapiekanka were good. The zapiekanka was toasted too much, as in it was a deep brown color. Would have been better if it was toasted properly. Besides this, everything else was a serious disappointment. They serve you the food on large plates, and the meat will take up most of the plate. What they do is pound out the meat so much that it becomes wide and flat, hence making it seem like you are getting a lot of food. Newsflash &#34;Bacowka&#34; owners, we can tell you do this. And it seriously ruins the quality of the meat. 

My grilled chicken was chewy and didn&#39;t have any seasoning. The kotlety were deep fried to a crisp, or more like a damn crunch. This is something I&#39;ve never experienced while eating polish food made by my parents, relatives, friends, in Poland, and in Polish restaurants in Chicago. The fries were not fully cooked, for both of the two plates that they came with. Like raw potatoes with you dinner? And how can you even mess up coleslaw? I had a few bites and couldn&#39;t eat it, plus I&#39;m not a picky eater. The person in our group who ordered the potato pancakes with gulasz ate only 1/4 of it, and didn&#39;t take the rest home. Oh, and the grilled oscypek with zurawina.. yeah the cheese had a &#34;gummy&#34; texture and the jam came straight from a jar.

I&#39;m suprised this place has such a high rating, which is the only reason we came here. My advice is to go to the nearest Polish deli and order some hot meals from behind the counter. Would probably taste better than this food which is not fresh at all. Or drive 15 minutes from here and go to &#34;U Gazdy&#34; where you can get properly cooked, and flavorful food. Your chicken or kotlet won&#39;t be pounded out like theres no tomorrow. 1/5, the prices are pretty cheap, but you get what you pay for.

it is a super tiny location. I think there are maybe 7 tables and a small counter that 3-4 people can sit at. They aimed for a rustic decor-wood tables and chairs, that is successful and homey.
But it&#39;s the food that is a standout. It&#39;s a typical menu for poland or germany, but isn&#39;t  necessarily common here. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve been disappointed with anything I&#39;ve ordered. I don&#39;t normally eat polish sausage in restaurants-there is a polish grocery that shares the parking lot, and if you have good quality polish sausage available it&#39;s the simplest possible dish to make at home, yet this place makes it better then I can. The tenderloin and pancakes are standouts, as are the Pierogi. 
The Pierogi. Oh my god. The combinations of textures and flavors is superb. The chewy firmness of the dough, instantly replaced with the explosion of meat coupled with the cold crunch of cabbage, with just a drizzle of olive oil for a liquid feel.
Every dish here is an event to savor.
European cuisine can be criticized as being focused on the meat component but here every dish is very well balanced out, being matched with a vegetable component. you are not having a meat or veg dish, you are having a MEAL, complete with both. the balancing of the portions is well, exquisite. 
Regional polish beer, herbal tea, and upon occasion grzaniec (mulled wine) are available as drinks, and can make delightful pairings with the food. If you chose a soda it will be a bottle or can-there is no soda fountain.
Parking is unlimited-this is sizable strip mall with a huge parking lot Since the resturant so small the service is perfect. If the waitress isn&#39;t within line of sight, it&#39;s because she&#39;s in the kitchen helping the cook and/or getting your order.

 I thought the pirk chop my boyfriend ordered was good, was deep fried which was unusual for me. his concern was that it tasted like fish so I think they deep-fried the pork chop in the same oil as the fish. He doesn&#39;t like fish.

I will say I do regret not actually eating at the restaurant cause it is such a beautiful restaurant inside! They have these cool animal hides for backing of the booths that looked really unique and cool. A lot of wood, which I tend to like, was an art form with beautiful pictures up on the walls. Now to the food! I ordered the sampler plate and I was not disappointed! The potato pancake was crispy and flavorful! The sausage had a nice snap to it with a spicy inside which was really nice along with the mashed potatoes with that lovely tomato sauce(very similar to Greek tomato sauce).

bacowka-schaumburg-3,John G.,z1rPeMGXDRpn8_4RVp5r5w,CZKGZaVL0oUqKV4d0ED45g,"A hole-in-the-wall that lives up to expectations.

Bacowka is a tiny little restaurant that doesn&#39;t get nearly as much traffic as it should.  Wedged into a tiny corner of the strip mall on Roselle, Bacowka is hard to spot but keep at it until you find it, because it&#39;s a small gem.

Having eaten meals in a Polish household, I can only imagine that the kitchen is essentially someone&#39;s home.  At times you can even hear the chef pounding out the chicken as it&#39;s made for your meal.  All the food here seems to harken back to the experience-trained cooking of generations.  In a number of trips, the GoâÉbki (cabbage rolls), pork goulash, pierogi, and everything else have all been cooked perfectly.

For vegetarians, while meat-heavy Eastern Europe can be daunting (and definitely is on display here) there are actually quite a few choices that easily fit the bill from the potato pancakes, to pierogi (make sure to request no bacon - that was somewhat painful to type) and great sides including coleslaw, amazing dill potatoes, and cucumber or beet salads.

The interior complements the home cooked feeling with a mountain cabin feel.  The tables and chairs have been crafted from slabs of wood which match the rustic log walls bear skin rug.  Even the mismatched silverware here doesn&#39;t detract but just continues to add to the feeling that you might just be in someone&#39;s home.

The prices here are really a steal.  A filling meal can be had for $6-8 and if you&#39;re feeling exceptionally hungry, the combination plate with a little of almost everything checks in at nearly $15. 

As pretty much the only Polish restaurant in Schaumburg, this one is a unique but definite winner.",18/02/15,185,4,1,3,-27,2.2759000000000005,1.159,0.522,12.319,No,1709

They had already started breaking down and cleaning up for the night, but insisted that we come in and order dinner.  We were the only ones there, but were not rushed by any means.  The staff was absolutely awesome!  

The food was abundant and delicious to top it off.  We ordered some pierogies to start with, which were to cooked perfectly.  I had the pork cutlet and she had the potato pancakes.  Both of our entries were very large and we wound up bringing some home with us.

Kraut and mushroom Pierogies were some of the best we&#39;ve had... Skin not too doughy...thin, slightly chewy... And tossed with a bit of bacon and onions.  Being a flaczky ( tripe soup) junkie, I had to order a bowl... Came out in a surprisingly large bowl with slices of rye bread to dip into it!  Soup had a great slightly smokey flavor and was filled with tender strips of tripe!  The potato pancakes with goulash was super cozy.. The crisp think potato pancakes enveloped this amazingly moist, tender chunks of meat... All smothered in a gravy-ish sauce...wow!  

Inside if the restaurant was cute!  Like a little cozy log cabin!  Not usually into that lodge-y type look but it worked in this case... Totally adorable!  Clean interior and the waitress was super friendly and polite!

Bacowka is a charmingly decorated and seemingly authentic Polish restaurant just minutes away from home. Pine walls, tables, and ridiculously heavy chairs complete with bar chairs with fur throws and a bear skin on the wall really sets the mood despite the utterly mundane area of Schaumburg this gem is located at. 

We ordered the obligatory potato and cheese pierogies, kielbasa, and potato pancakes with beef goulash.  The pierogies were fresh and were topped with chewy bits of bacon. If you&#39;re a fan of sour cream with your pierogies the you&#39;ll have to ask for a side of it because ours didn&#39;t come with it. It was a request easily filled at no extra charge. I&#39;m still a noob when it comes to Polish food but I thought these pierogies were certainly above average and satisfied my ever nagging craving for those tasty little Polish dumplings.

The kielbasa came grilled, split in half lengthwise and topped with kraut served with a few pieces of bread and ketchup and mustard for dipping. I thought the ketchup and mustard was a little strange but we went with it. The ketchup ruined the smokey goodness of the sausage for me but just a hint of the plain yellow mustard helped to break up any flavor monotony.

The star of the show was by far the potato pancakes absolutely smothered in that rich beef goulash. Wow, I couldn&#39;t get enough of the stuff. It was served with two pickle spears to break up the richness of the goulash, I&#39;m assuming. Pure comfort food right there and I&#39;m sure that this will be my staple dish here.

Service was polite but not overbearing... just the way I like it.

We were the only couple here on a Friday night but 2 more couples came in as we were finishing up.  This place is tiny and can fill up quick so I was surprised to see such a lack of clientele at this time.  They just opened up 3 months ago, according to our waitress, so maybe people don&#39;t know about this place yet.

I really enjoyed the food here as it was reasonably priced with portions that matched the price and the quality was great. I hope business picks up for them because I&#39;m so glad to have a place like this so close to home.

I am fortunate in that I have had some amazing meal experiences of various different kind of food. This was one of those amazing dining experiences. 

The restaurant itself is a quaint, little place in a strip mall. The furniture is as unique as the food, wooden tables and chairs (very comfortable), there is a large beautiful photo of a meadow in Poland that has a mountain range in the background. On the opposite wall is a Black Bear skin.

I was waited on by two beautiful women who were very gracious, welcoming, attentive and helpful. I tried an authentic Polish beer and it was very good, my meal was a breaded pork loin covered in mushrooms and cheese, with sliced fried potatoes and four small salads, cucumber, red cabbage, a sauerkraut like salad and a salad that resembled coleslaw.

We had received a menu in the mail and it looked good. I had the Red Borscht soup with dumplings. It was served in a huge bowl. Clear gorgeous broth and meat filled dumplings with the most wonderful flavor. We also ordered the cheese &amp; potato pierogies. They came with onions and bacon. So delightfully light and tender. Hubby and I both had the Hungarian Potato Pancakes with Beef Goulash. Oh. My. Goodness. First of all the food was hot. I mean really hot. It stayed hot the entire meal. You just don&#39;t find that in a restaurant these days. The pancakes were crispy on the edges and so fluffy. The meat was fall apart tender; like butter. The sauce with vegetables, cheese and fresh green onions complimented the dish perfectly. The pickle spears lent a refreshing balance to the meal. I ordered coffee and Sylvia brought it out in a huge charming bowl reminiscent of the huge mugs they drank coffee out of in the show &#34;Friends&#34;. The most wonderful touch was the homemade whipped cream which she added because she just knew I would like it. So delicious and a wonderful end to the meal. You just don&#39;t find old world charm like this, especially in the suburbs. Like other reviewers said, it is very small. The furniture is sturdy, huge and looks finely crafted. The cabin atmosphere with the fur backed barstools and bear skin on the wall lent a cozy feel to the warm comforting homey ambiance. Absolutely love this place! We will be back many times.

This visit we had smoked wings.  Hands down best wings I&#39;ve had in a couple years.  The BBQ rub were great, the rub is slightly sweeter.  We both agreed the buffalo-and-slow were awesome. Smokey, spicy, and delicious.  

The roasted cauliflower app is rather big and is roasted with lots of garlic and onions, and topped with olives and tomatoes. Really good. The vegetarian chili was super flavorful and surprisingly hot. Perfect amount of spice for me, but a bit too hot for her.

Most entrees are around $12.  For a quality sandwich big enough for two, that&#39;s an excellent deal.

I also ordered a side of macaroni &amp; cheese.  This was again a good size portion which was extra creamy and so, so satisfying!  

I came here for dinner with a friend, street parking is available right on State St. or just around the corner, and the interior of Nobel House is much larger than the pictures show.  There was live music on a Thursday night which was obviously louder the closer you sat to the stage, but the volume was comfortable toward the rear of the restaurant.

I can&#39;t believe we let 4 years pass and not slip into Nobel House.  Finally did Sunday evening and it hit the head right on the &#34;need that place that get&#39;s it&#34; nail.
The kitchen executed flawlessly with flavor, creativity and mix.  6 dishes between the two of us and each wasn&#39;t even close to just being &#34;ok&#34;.  All exceeded expectations.  They really get flavor, texture and offering something for many palettes.  Even with ingredient adjustments here and there the plates were amazing.
Beer list is great, though I am just a porter/stout guy...and they didn&#39;t disappoint there either.
Atmosphere is simplistically cool, and great music playing in the background.
It was a Sunday evening, so there were a few kids in the place (I guess young parents need a sanity check once in a while).  If you want zero kids, probably a different evening.  Otherwise it is just loud enough to drown it out, but not too loud to talk.
Service...not bad.  On Sunday the service crew was young, and it showed at times.  But really, everything else so made up for this.

We came in on a late Tuesday.  The servers were super nice, friendly, and attentive and let us get an order in before the kitchen closed (at 10pm).  I had the Rueben&#39;s Sister Rachel and the smoked turkey was on point.  The onion rings and accompanying chipotle sauce were (somehow casually) maybe the best I&#39;ve ever had.  My girlfriends brussel sprouts were really tasty and her chicken sandwich was good too.  I&#39;ve got my eye on the sweet fries and mac &amp; cheese for the sides during my next visit.

I had the veggie chili, which was yummy, but I wasn&#39;t too sold on the texture of mushrooms which competed with the beans in a slightly odd way. Don&#39;t get me wrong: I love mushrooms. Just not in chili. They also have a black bean burger which I haven&#39;t confirmed the vegan-ness of, but which looks really good, and I would definitely give this place another shot to test that theory.

My mom had a somewhat less enjoyable experience here. See, we&#39;re from pretty darn close to New England, and have eaten some REAL lobster rolls, notably from Maine and Massachusetts. I&#39;m not a seafood eater anymore, but if I were, I&#39;d probably save it for trips back home. My mom got the lobster roll here and was hugely disappointed. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m shocked, considering that people around here don&#39;t know what bagels or pizza really are either. So maybe stick to local fare. 

Also, if you&#39;re not a fan of country music, well... maybe you won&#39;t be a huge fan of this place.

We normally always hit up a bar in that area, which is never a problem since there are plenty.  He kept suggesting that we try Nobel House, but from the outside it looked like a cafe and not a bar.  I finally relented and we went this past Saturday for lunch and oh how wrong I was, this might be my new favorite place.  
Nobel House isn&#39;t very big on the inside, but big enough and there was never an empty table, so apparently other people know about this little gem.  They have an extensive beer menu with mostly local craft beers on tap (always a plus) and they have a pretty big food menu as well.  Normally at a new place I get a burger, but something on the menu caught my eye.... pulled bacon sandwich.  What sorcery is this?  I absolutely had to try it!  It&#39;s essentially a pulled pork sandwich, but made with the cut of pork normally reserved for bacon.  Apparently this is a thing, but I had never heard of it before, so that&#39;s what I ordered.

I remember bookmarking it for the craft beer and awesome gastropubby small plates menu and I will say that Nobel House delivered there big time.  I really was not expecting this tiny little joint to pack such a good list considering it is listed as a both a &#34;bar and a breakfast &amp; brunch/american&#34; place.  At least on yelp, it is.  I will say that the vibe there is totally weird because of the split personality though.  I walked in and immediately felt like I was in a Nashville honky tonk turned daytime breakfast place who might also be trying to be a gastropub and a sports bar all at once.  I mean, whatever, to each his own.  The loud twangy bluegrass and the smoked meat aroma that blasted me when I walked in certainly aided in that impression.  I can overlook the horrid music (and I don&#39;t REALLY care about the atmosphere) if the beer and food are good though so I ventured onward to the bar.  The bartender took awhile to stop flirting and come over to help us but once she did, the service was pretty good.  And the beer list?  Let&#39;s talk about that again since it is the most important matter, really.  IT WAS EXCELLENT.  There was an entire page of good craft beer both on tap and in bottle.  And lots of it was local(ish).  There was even several beers that my snobby a** hasn&#39;t tried.  Also, you can get a premade IPA flight or their flight of the day (both of which are predetermined...though I bet they would switch some things out for you as they didn&#39;t seem like the type of place that hates on that, but I could be wrong).  And the food (which we only tried one plate since we were hopping) was excellent.  We got the smoked wings which can be split into two sauces (we went with buffalo and sriracha) with ranch and blue cheese.  All the food, including the obviously homemade dressings were totally legit.  I could&#39;ve drank the blue cheese right out of the ramekin because a) it was THAT delicious and b) I&#39;m disgusting.

The pork wings had amazing flavor &amp; the &#34;smoke&#34; taste was definitely dominant. If you&#39;re not a fan of that, stay away.

The beer selection was great, plenty of local brews, lots of seasonal and rotational choices. They were overly dependent on IPA&#39;s like lots of bars. That&#39;s great as I&#39;m not a fan of all the hoppiness of them. They have grilled frog legs as an app special, they were slathered in a citrus Thai sauce that was tasty but too spicy to really enjoy. The plate also had a bed of coleslaw that had an interesting ingredient, bleu cheese. It made for a creamy flavor that was great. I followed the frog with the steakhouse sandwich. I wouldn&#39;t call it a sandwich as you can&#39;t pick it up and eat it. Best thing was to cut it up and eat it with a fork. The steak/cheese/onion combo tasted good, but the meat was a little tough for being cooked med rare.

They changed their menu a bit since I was last there, but it looks like they were all good changes. I had the tako tacos which were extremely flavorful and had a nice kick of spice to them. It was my first time trying octopus in tacos and I was not disappointed. Somehow the cilantro in the tacos complimented the octopus very well. I also had their Prairie Path beer which is a nice crisp golden ale and it went very well with the tacos; it wasn&#39;t too sweet or too bitter and it balanced out the meal very nicely.

Got a nice tall table near the bar, and we were digging into some oysters, a bottle of wine, and the best REAL fried salad I&#39;ve had in a long time when a different bartender suddenly appears mumbling about doing a favor for him. He looked kind of odd so I said that my partner might suckhimoff for big bucks but that wasn&#39;t my thing (although I hadn&#39;t seen his money :~);  then he started mumbling something about a big crowd etc... And when I asked him &#34;if he was asking us to move to a smaller table?&#34; he then started to mumble about comping something until he saw our  bottle of wine and then he mumbled off.
I don&#39;t think the rest of the servers liked him much either because we got big smiles the rest of the night and continued great service.

nobel-house-geneva,Matthew H.,xiABRgWddY_U8UqJrCzOIA,fmKzd74HyZlM3ix-7jkybA,"I tried this place a few weeks ago.  I didn&#39;t expect to like this place as much as I did.  I had no expectations and I didn&#39;t even know what kind of a food they served when my Wife and I made plans with another couple to meet for dinner.  The menu isn&#39;t huge but they do have a large specials menu on the wall.  The place specializes in BBQ, and I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this since I just smoked 10 pounds of short ribs last weekend but, I just wasn&#39;t in the mood for BBQ when I showed up.  I therefore ordered their burger and it was very very good.  The meat was seasoned well and the toppings were ample.

For appetizers we ordered the Pork wings which were tasty but were a little dry.  This is normal in my opinion for such a small smoked piece of meat but I just wanted to mention that if someone really can&#39;t have their meat a little barky on the outside.  We also had the roasted garlic and that was fantastic.  I&#39;ll definitely go back just for that.

My wife got the pulled pork sandwich and being one that smokes about 15 pounds of butt each year I can say it was quite good.  Shoulder is hard to mess up though.

My One friend ordered the lobster roll and he said he thoroughly enjoyed it.  The amount of lobster was pretty ample too.

My other friend ordered the burnt ends.  I was trying to get my wife to order them since I at least wanted to try but she shared them and they were very tasty...Think beef bacon.

All in all a solid establishment with great food.  Although it seemed like a while before our initial drink order the service for repeat drinks and food was very prompt from there out and the server was very friendly.  The atmosphere is befitting a small pub style urban BBQ location and is exactly as you&#39;d expect it.

It was good, and they cooked my hash browns damn near burnt (just like I like &#39;em!) Husband had the Belly Melt, which was almost the same thing as mine, except with no eggs and on bread. Very good. 

We also split a poutine with brisket. I was a bit disappointed that the brisket was sliced and not chopped, but that&#39;s just splitting hairs at this point.

We basically had to shout at one another, and our waitress had to shout to be heard as well- and so did all of the other patrons- seemed a bit silly.

Now, onto everything I loved. The entire rest of our experience was five stars :) Our waitress was very friendly, and arrived quickly when we got there. My husband enjoyed a beer from the local Penrose brewery, and I tried two delicious cocktails. The first was their take on a cosmo which involved pop rocks (delicious and dangerous), and I also tried my first mojito (blueberry) which was wonderful and refreshing. We started our meal with the poutine, which was lovely- not sure what the cheese was but it was perfect with the appetizer, we couldn&#39;t finish it- but enjoyed it nonetheless. For entrees, my husband had a burger, and I had the meat with two sides plate. Both of us had the adult mac and cheese as a side and I absolutely loved it- ate every single bite. I like that the brisket came with multiple sauces- all delicious.

My hat goes off to Nobel House - I think they offer well-prepared, interesting dishes at reasonable prices. I thoroughly enjoy the mussels and Parmesan fries as a main course (though it is listed as an appetizer), and am a fan of the ceviche (my husband is not...not everyone has good tastes!). The crab cakes are another go-to item for me, but pass on the crab-cake sandwich, which just has way too much bread! 

The charcuterie plate is a great option if you&#39;re dining with a group, as you can choose from a variety of cheeses and meats and the portions are more than decent.

The waitstaff is terrific; my family is a big fan of Kate, but we&#39;re a bit biased, as we know her brother and his fiance! Honestly though, we have had nothing but good service at Nobel House.

nobel-house-geneva,Adam B.,QPPRfD8JxPypOgIP2ekTTQ,b6Fm0M7U7sOs1u1-LT0_nQ,"I first tried their food at Festival of the Vine when I sampled the burnt ends. They were so flavorful that I knew I was going to eat here. I asked for a sample of a Penrose beer and our server promptly delivered it, which is a definite plus. I ordered the Big Texas burger, a 1/2 pounder with smoked brisket, cheese, onion straws, mushrooms, and a side of BBQ sauce. Oh my goodness, this was amazing. Juicy burger that was just a fun mess to pick up! The brisket had just a little hickory smoke flavor and was very moist. The onions were crispy and the sauce was very rich. I think the only thing I&#39;d do is add a few jalapenos for some heat. 

The fries were marvelous, fresh cut with a sprinkling of seasoning and Parmesan cheese. The beans were pretty good, they definitely had some BBQ sauce, so they were a bit sweet for my taste.

nobel-house-geneva,Alissa S.,RRkkLEBt2DljjjI7WuAfdQ,evvk6EjjfzbM3IL56JbS-A,"Meh. Disappointing. 

I&#39;d been here about six months ago and had been dreaming of the poutine with brisket ever since. 

Fast forward to today. First, we got serious side-eye from the waitstaff when we asked to move to a nearby table right after being seated (we were right under a vent that was blowing cold air on a cold day). When it was time to order, I inquired about the oysters and I expressed my preference for brine. My server steered me toward a cleaner NY selection, which sounded fine to me. When they were delivered, she informed me that she&#39;d asked the chef and he told her the BC oysters were more briny, so that&#39;s what she ordered for me (in spite of the fact that she said they weren&#39;t good earlier). Um ... thanks? I would have preferred that she relay the chefs recommendation and allowed me to make the choice myself. 

The biggest disappointment was the brisket on the poutine, which came to the table with no visible char  and was at least 60 percent fat - pulled from the smoker a bit too early, I&#39;m guessing. I picked at it, and ate some but discarded a fair amount of it. Nothing like the magical dish I&#39;d had in the fall. MAJOR letdown. 

On top of that, my mother&#39;s onion soup was nearly inedible (overwhelmed with seasoning) and my father wasn&#39;t offered a refill on his long-empty Arnold Palmer. Will not be back.",10/05/15,150,2,2,-1,12,-1.33,1.087,2.699,12.214,No,1373

The actual setup is poor, tables that are wobbly and feel like you are right in the middle of an aisle. Service was adequate, nothing great or worth noting positively.

I had the steak sandwich, and it really was pretty good, but very hard to eat on the pretzel roll. The &#34;house made chips&#34; were NOT house made in my opinion, out of a bag I think. Very over seasoned, and Barbeque flavored. When I mentioned that to the waitress, she said they are about to redo the menu and the new menu will say they are Barbeque. HUH???? So you wouldn&#39;t mention that when I ordered it??? She didn&#39;t even offer to bring another side. I ate two of them.

Husband had the crab cake club. Too much breading, not much crab, and here&#39;s a clue. When you serve something soft like that, do not use ciabatta bread that&#39;s hard and dry, because when you bite it, everything sqooshes out and all you get is stale bread.

Much like the mussels, the BELLY MELT didn&#39;t wow the crowd. The pulled pork and belly were a bit dry, and the bitter jicama slaw did not marry well with the appeal of the overall sandwich.

The choice of a charcuterie and cheese platter was a great idea to start! It came with olives and fig jam to offset the other tastes, a nice touch. 

After that, my entree (I got the crab cakes off the appetizer menu and the macaroni as a size) was slightly lackluster.

We sat at the bar and I was approached by a man(who claims he is the owner) from behind the bar asking me to change my language. Im not sure what I had said to offend anyone but I brushed his request off not thinking much of it.  

Within 10 mins, shortly after we placed our food order he started yelling at the other 3 people I was with in regards to our &#34;behavior/language&#34;- It unfortunately blew up quickly, I paid the tab(enjoy your chargeback) and quickly left.

I own and operate 3 restaurants &amp; in my 10 years of experience I&#39;ve never delt with any of my customers in this manor nor is his behavior excusable. Regardless of who is right or wrong in this situation if he treats his customers this way I can only image how he treats his employees. The rage in his face was unreal. We all have good and bad days while working in the service industry but there are better ways to handle customers. 

And for those who had to hear the yelling inside the restaurant, for that my apologies. I&#39;ll never be back, as we were regulars, stopping in couple times a week.

nobel-house-geneva,Richard L.,z_YNv_0cGtmf1KxLgRCGPg,QpzEvpTx5rSKQI18u7C5YA,"Welcome to the neighborhood. Another in this list of AWESOME Geneva based hot spots that really meets or even exceeds the word on the street. This restaurant is one that we will definitely return to. Great food and service!

My wife and I had the opportunity last minute to catch dinner together and although they were extremely busy (I understand they are regularly full or busy) we were seated quickly and serviced immediately. The server was knowledgeable although I did challenge her knowledge regarding menu she never lost focus or got flustered, she asked questions of the leadership and chiefs staff and came back with all the explanations required to understand and make decisions. 

Food - OK if you know me you know I have traveled the world tasting food and most recently over the last couple of years focused on BBQ quite a bit. (Mexican and Asian food are my focuses of trifecta) I ordered the brisket with beans, slaw and cornbread. I normally start a new restaurant with a sampler platter of BBQ so I can find my favorite and ensure I am well fed. I didn&#39;t see an offering like that on the menu but for some reason I was drawn to the brisket directly. (this is a smoke house and they use Hickory) I am a big time foodie and smoke food almost weekly myself so I come from a perspective that I believe lends value to my reviews regarding BBQ. The brisket was plentiful, butterfly platted and tasted great. I received a healthy amount of beef and it was moist and elastic just like you would expect. I received both slices and some heavily smoked ends ( the industry likes to call this the burnt ends but because they are cooked indirectly it is not burnt or charred it is simply heavily smoked and cooked more than the inside) both had unique flavor and a mild smoke finish. I really enjoyed it. The beans are AWESOME. These are absolutely homemade ( not prepared off site or out of a can and to the plate) The molasses finish is unlike anything I have found in the Midwest. These beans are ridiculous and I have to get more. the slaw was sweet and tasty and really complemented the meal it pared nice with the brisket and the sauce. It was obviously homemade and complex with lots of different types of veg and fresh ingredients. Finally the cornbread, it has a slight spiced finish with the down home sweetness of corn (possibly cream corn and honey) the piece on my plate and every one I could see was large 2.5x2.5x1.5 yes that is a nice piece of cornbread. It was moist and full of flavor. Heck it could be desert. To sum it up the food I received was perfect or close to perfect. My wife had similar remarks.

Service - Door to door incredible. I mentioned how busy they were and I can tell you that most restraints hit a threshold when they are busy and service is impacted. Nobel House is staffed well prepared for the busy times. The server seemed to enjoy working with us and had fun working to satisfy us. The beer was served perfectly the food came out fast and fresh. She checked on us at appropriate intervals and to top it off the owner proprietor visited our table to ask us how we enjoyed the meal and service and then for what ever reason brought the chief to our table to share a moment in his busy evening. We talked about some of his finer points that delivered such a special flavor to the table he shook my hand and quickly got back to his responsibilities. For me this is huge. I love it when I can build a relationship with a restaurant. Relationships build alliances for companies and even though this seems self evident many proprietors don&#39;t get it. 

To sum it up - We will be back and I can not wait to try other items on the menu. I am positive Nobel house will easily achieve a 5 star in the next couple of revisits. Those of you who follow me know I don&#39;t give a 5 on the first visit. (They deserved  a 5 but standards are standards)

Thank you Nobel House!",11/11/14,417,4,4,5,120,15.577900000000001,8.249,0.39899999999999997,30.351000000000006,No,3915

riganato-old-world-grille-geneva,Lucas C.,#NAME?,wQZaAOSp6ZxXmRvDkAIFFw,"I feel like three stars is being generous with this one...   So my family and i were trying to find a place we could go for lent Friday&#39;s (no meat). We usually turn towards either sushi or pizza, and then we remembered a friend who had recommended riganato.  We thought alright well get some pizza, pasta and calamari it&#39;ll be great.  So...

Food- We started off with some fried calamari which was really good, but as I always say, doesn&#39;t take a lot to make a good fried calamari.  However it did come with some garlic aioli which was a plus (more suitable for dipping pizza crust in though).  Now, the pizza. It was amazing.  Literally the perfect pie.  Perfect thin crispy crust, tangy but not too tangy sauce.  Sauce wasn&#39;t too chunky but not soup either.  Cheese was thick but not overpowering.  It was REALLY good.  So we ordered the calamari and the cheese pizza as an appetizer, but then the entrees is where the fell extremely short.  I ordered the bow tie farfalle which came with these grilled shrimps that were cooked perfectly but overseasoned.  The pasta though was inedible.  So much pesto and artichoke it was not even box-able for lunch the next day.  Everyone else&#39;s entrees looked just mediocre...   With mediocre table reactions.  They got us on the mini desserts though and we ordered a bunch and they were decent, nothing too special.  

Service- It was really good and the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice.

Now I realize this is a grill and we went with no meat in mind but if you put something on the menu like a pasta dish it better be as good as everything else plus this is Italian so I didn&#39;t take too much of a risk!!

We were in vacay mode just for the fun of it, plus we had a little birthday celebration attitude going as well.

It turns out, if an overheard conversation is true, that the restaurant is celebrating its third anniversary.

The restaurant has indoor and outdoor dining.  We chose indoor.  Wood floors, simple table settings.  Fresh food pictures on the wall.  (For good reason).

The menu is a single sheet with the usual categories.  

I carefully studied the food that was at other tables--the pizza looked very tempting--so I ordered the pizza with spinach, fresh basil and fresh garlic.  

For the pizza, they don&#39;t fool around, making sure that it&#39;s understood that they are the thin crust folks--great! thin crust folks I&#39;d say.  The sauce was rich in flavor with each ingredient seemingly freshly harvested that day, within the hour.

The birthday one ordered gluten free pasta--the sausage and tomato that came with the order, causing a bit of light sauce that looked great.  And positively reviewed.

Reasonable prices, great, fresh food!

riganato-old-world-grille-geneva,Emily H.,o3re0qTH4Ot5OK7znl5_6g,#NAME?,"A classy-looking house on State street hides a welcome surprise - Riganato&#39;s!

Riganato&#39;s has one of the most extensive gluten-free menus I&#39;ve seen in the western suburbs. There was a nice selection of chicken, seafood, pizza and roasted entrees for the non-wheaties among us and the menu also included some simpler fare (burgers/sandwiches) for those obstinate family members who refuse to eat fancy. That alone guarantees we will be back, being that my family has Celiacs and picky eaters a-plenty. 

Their otherwise glutinous fare was middle of the road Italian-ish food. I feel like they erred on the side of caution with spicing their sauces, because when things were called &#34;spicy&#34; and &#34;garlic&#34; there were very few hints of those adjectives actually tasted in the food. Be brave with flavor Riganato&#39;s, you have the potential for greatness!

The wine selection was decent, though I was a little put off by the server&#39;s inexperienced at pouring wine. I would rather have poured it myself than watch her maneuver around the table dribbling wine on the bread plates, cutlery and bread.

The only place Riganato&#39;s let us down was the dessert menu. No gluten free desserts. They don&#39;t actually have a dessert menu and instead bring around a dessert tray where nothing is labeled and everything kind of looks the same in Riganato&#39;s mood lighting. Due to the lack of gluten-free options and the server&#39;s complete lack of interest in selling us on the available options, we all opted to skip dessert.

The service is very good, very sweet waitress and host was pleasant. We started with the octopus which came on a bed of arugula and smothered in raw red onion. It was cold and shouldnt have been as it was grilled. I found it mediocre. Needed flavor and some charing.  
We then had the greek lemon and rice chicken soup and as a Greek I can say it was good. I had to add lemon but I usually do. We then had the kabobs. 
I had the chicken and my date had the beef. Served with a large pita that was black from all the oregano. 
Again, cold. And even though it was drowned in oregano and I mean BAD, it was tasteless. 
It needed salt and pepper and far LESS oregano. Lemon would have been a good addition since its called lemon chicken kabob. 
We both had a mini cannoli for desert which are brought in. Kinda stale. 
I may give this another try even though this wasnt a great experience. Im glad we didnt order the $25.00 lamb shank.

I would dine there more often, but I live about 25 miles east of Geneva. The restaurant is in an old remodeled farmhouse. The last time I was there, they had outside dining on a back porch, but they have since enclosed that area, so they can accommodate more diners in inclement weather. There were 3 of us in the party, and we had lunch. We started off by sharing some appetizers. The baseball size stuffed meatballs are a must. I had them on each visit. We also had the grilled octopus, and the beets. The cocktails ordered were house creations, and very good. Two of us had the lamb shank, and one the lamb chops. The lamb shank was very tender, and the tomato based sauce gave it a great flavor. My girlfriend had the lamb chops, and said they were cooked perfect, just as she ordered them. Side dishes were good. We topped off lunch with some homemade rice pudding. I would rate the whole meal as excellent. The food is very fresh. When I saw the truck in the parking lot delivering fresh fish, there was no doubt. I would consider Riganato&#39;s a Greek-Italian fusion restaurant. I would recommend that any diner make reservations, as the restaurant is small, and they do have large parties at times.",08/06/16,148,5,2,5,33,4.4094999999999995,3.0100000000000002,0.247,16.743000000000002,No,1260

Nice, small, cozy and run by very friendly engaging people who know about their food and are willing to share their thoughts is how I would describe this place.

Char Grilled Octopus
Up there with the best I have ever had. Don&#39;t change this dish.

Jalapeno Gnocchi
I am not sure who is responsible for their Gnocchi but they are very talented. I have had Gnocchi all over and even make it at home and this was the best I have ever had. Love the take on the Pesto with Jalapeno. Don&#39;t change this dish!

Fresh Beets 
Great salad course.

Tortellini Alla Panna
Great texture and Flavor.

Butternut Squash Gnocchi
See Gnocchi review above. Great dish!

We also had 2 make your own pizza&#39;s
I am a pizza lover and like lots of different styles of pizza. While the pizza was good, I probably wouldn&#39;t order it here again. Too many other great thing on the menu and these pizza&#39;s didn&#39;t WOW me like the rest of the food did.

My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs which they are known for and he loved them. The meatballs are stuffed with ricotta cheese. They are the best! I had the Caesar salad and then the lemon oregano kabob. It was tasty but the chicken was a little dry. Our two younger sons were with us. One had the pizza was was really good and the other had a burger. My only complaint was that the kids menu is limited to chicken fingers or grilled cheese. So we had to buy adult entrees for them which they couldn&#39;t finish. That made the dinner out quite pricey. I gave them 4 stars because of the limited kids menu. The service was great!!

If you want great authentic Italian food this is the spot to come get it at, and it gets better -they are not over priced. 

They have great customer service. Jimmy is great!

Ok so lets get down to the food. I&#39;ve been here three times since I discovered this gem and I&#39;ve yet to be disappointed by anything that&#39;s been served.

Spaghetti and meatballs -to die for!!! I&#39;ve ordered this all three times. Today they had a special with one meatball, Italian sausage, and penne pasta. My boyfriend loved it so much he asked our server to please keep this on the menu permanently! Lol 

Lamb chops and chicken- I&#39;ve never been to crazy about lamb chops
 but these were awesomely delicious! Chicken was juicy and flavorful.

Gnocchi is rich and a must try! 

Pizza by far the best pizza I&#39;ve ever had ( no lie) seriously this is the perfect pizza - the crust is so crispy and the sauce is just the perfect flavor! 

Hmmmmm.... What else.... Oh yea their bread they bring out at the beginning of dinner I can&#39;t even describe other than perfect. However be careful , it&#39;s so delicious that you may end up filling up on it! 

Calamari  and saganaki are our favorite appetizers . 

So yea I obviously will definitely be coming back to this place as long as they are in business. If your a fan of great food and awesome friendly service this is a place you definitely want to go to! I know there&#39;s a couple of reviews that weren&#39;t all that great but who knows what really happened .

riganato-old-world-grille-geneva,Tom C.,vfwE8PC3b0NqGGhtBYnSTA,iXIhrDHUbt34xZ5KeKADng,"My wife, daughter, and I went fairly early on a Saturday night (530) after I saw generally good yelp reviews.  Overall it was disappointing.  

Atmosphere was not good - lighting was too bright - felt I was dining in the light level of your average grocery store or Walmart.   Not relaxing or inviting at all.   The tables were crammed into the dining room and uncomfortably close - difficult to get into your table without nearly asking the adjacent diners to please scoot in.  Another weird thing was that the tables by the windows had white tablecloths, but then most of the other tables did not (including ours).  Did we not deserve a white tablecloth?   The chairs and tables had a dated feel and the decor in the place was very generic and cheap looking, and a white table cloth on all the tables would have classes the place up some.  This contributed to a general sense of amateurism and lack of taste in the decor and the general execution of the restaurant.  

We ordered some white wine and it was ice cold -  don&#39;t restaurants like this realize that whites need to be served 42-50 degrees in most cases?  The food was mediocre.  Daughter had to order a full size cheese pizza because they didn&#39;t have a kids personal pizza on the menu.  I had the signature baked chicken dish that was decent.  My wife had some pasta that was bland and uninspired.  

Service was uneventful and adequate.  Price was actually high considering the lack of atmosphere and mediocre food.  Overall a giant &#34;meh&#34; and we won&#39;t be returning.",07/02/15,158,2,2,-1,21,-1.6989000000000003,0.663,1.719,14.618000000000002,No,1548

Everything tasted wonderful and the service was excellent! I love the Mediterranean menu! so many things to choose from. And so unique! I had the CAPRESE BURGER. It was cooked just the way I like it. I had the option to get soup instead of fries and it was the best Greek soup ever! NICK&#39;S CALAMARI and the fresh bread were served very quickly. Even my 16-year-old loved it!

Always had a wonderful meal at a very reasonable price!  It&#39;s refreshing to eat at a great family restaurant that&#39;s not a chain!  Our favorite dishes include Nick&#39;s Calamari, Meatball sub, Chicken Riganato (with garlic smashed that are to die for), Ribeye Kebobs, I could keep going...

I kept thinking I wanted to write a review, but what finally prompted me to do so was after I held a surprise party for my husband here last week.  I emailed Jimmy - chef and owner - about a month before.  He handled everything so gracefully and easily over email - helping me pick the menu, seating, etc...

We arrived that night to find an extra couple had arrived - Jimmy swooped in like it was no problem and added another table, turning our party of 16 into 18.  I arrived with my husband about twenty minutes after everyone else.  They were all enjoying hummus, fresh bread and drinks when we arrived.  Then the food started flowing - stuffed peppers, calamari, friend zucchini - all amazing!  It was all piping hot and fresh.

We had two salads come out next - Caesar and the House.  Both were phenomenal and I would have been happy to complete my meal at this point.  Next up were four amazing entrees.  I wish i would have taken photos to show the quantity of food - it was incredible!  We had flat iron steak, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken Riganato, and a spicy sausage pasta.  Each one was better than the next.  We also had mixed veggies and potatoes.  Every couple left with at least one container of leftovers - we left with five!

We had an assorted tray of desserts - I honestly can&#39;t tell you how they were - there was no way I could fit one more bite in but they looked delicious.

Bottom line - from start to finish - this was the easiest party I&#39;ve ever planned.  Everyone raved about the food.  The service was exceptional.  I would not hesitate to recommend Riganato&#39;s to anyone - seriously, an A+ experience!",20/12/13,229,5,2,5,24,7.8544,3.9369999999999994,0.439,17.625,No,2003

I had the horseradish cheeseburger with fries, and the kids (5 &amp; 4 yrs) split a classic cheeseburger with fries.  Overall, the food was above average and my wife told me that the fish was very good without trying it.

     We did not get dessert and she had the only glass of wine through dinner.  The bill was again around $50 for the four of us without really getting any alcoholic drinks, milk, or juice for the kids.

The Chicken Riganato was a bit salty for me but the pizzas are super thin and outstanding! I would have never ordered the beet appetizer on my own, but once I tried it, I was hooked: marinated with thinly sliced red onions. Yum! Others in my party had the pork chops and spaghetti and meatballs and everyone seemed happy with their pick. 

Two words of advice: 1. you NEED a reservation over the weekend at least. The restaurant is too small to really accommodate walk-ins and there is no waiting area except for outside. 2. ask for oil and parmesan with the warm bread. They serve it with butter but when we asked for another loaf of bread, they then asked if we would like a plate of olive oil and parmesan. Yes! It&#39;s really good olive oil. They also do not offer parmesan when the meal is dropped off, which I would expect with pizza and spaghetti. But they will bring it if you ask.

riganato-old-world-grille-geneva,David M.,t334vEaZ6yvKQD0Y4XTwjg,IPjN5fYZBpxPtdu7RhrloQ,"Half-assed hospitality.

I really wanted to like this place, but never had the chance.  Let me explain.

A friend and I had wanted to try Riganato for a couple of years.  Tonight was the night.  With spring in the air and a grumbling tummy, everything seemed right.

We arrived at 6:20 this evening and an older woman with blond hair told us that it would be a 25-minute wait.  I did not relish sitting around.  After waiting in the almost nonexistent waiting (cramped and two chairs) area for a couple of minutes, she asked us if we wanted a cocktail and to wait on the deck.  We declined the cocktail, but took the deck.  After fifteen minutes waiting out there, with blaring music and an ever stronger breeze, I decided to take a brief walk through the adjoining residential neighborhood.  My friend is the type of person who thinks nothing of agreeing to wait 45 minutes to an hour for any old type of restaurant.  I cap it at 10-15 minutes.  I was trying to be compliant and patient.

As I made my way back to the deck, I can see the blond woman summoning my friend.  She takes us back to the waiting area--not to a table.  At this point it becomes clear that SHE IS SEATING PEOPLE NOT BY WHEN THEY ARRIVED, BUT BY MATCHING UP THE WAITING PARTY TO THE SIZE OF THE JUST OPENED APPROPRIATE, AVAILABLE TABLE.

My friend politely asked how long it would be and also pointed out that the party just seated had arrived at least twenty-five minutes after we had.  She simply admitted that she was matching party size to available table and said &#34;it may be a few minutes more.&#34;  

With that, friend and I decided to get the hell out.  Blondie acted surprised.

The food smelled great and the menu tempting, but that type of hospitality will not entice me to come back.  In addition, seated is limited and with the fireplace roaring on a spring night, it was pretty stuffy with all the bodies in there.

Hospitality that horrible does not deserve a second chance.  We went back to Gemato&#39;s in Naperville.  Always a winner.",06/04/13,227,1,2,4,36,3.9595000000000002,3.0249999999999995,1.0639999999999998,21.912,No,2030

The atmosphere was warm and quaint and set the stage for what we thought would be a great meal. First, the staff took forever to get to us...all night...the 4 of them were apparently swamped by the 15 tables. Slow and inattentive is the best description.  

The menu was varied but no theme, we had read the meatballs and pizza were king. Well the meatballs were good but the pasta tasted like it was chef boy-r-dee. Not rustic, no flavor and overly sweet. The pizza was looked forward to but when it arrived we couldn&#39;t taste anything but the oregano, all of the other toppings were drown out...oregano was the flavor...that&#39;s it. 

Finally we were blown away with a check for over $200 because of mistaken entries. When I questioned it the server asked, in honest shock, if I was surprised it was so cheep and not $100 more. What?!?!

I may go back, but no over priced drinks and we are going to stick to the sandwich part of the menu. The one bright spot was a complimentary cocktail.

The closing of the Rib House was a shock, but we were happy to hear that something was in the works there.  Watched as the place was gutted and rehabbed top to bottom, and then finally some months ago a sign appeared.  Today it was time to visit.

We took two friends with, and upon entering were very impressed with the new design and decor--they did an excellent job and it was very warm and inviting with lots of light.  The interior, while still not spacious, has a much more open feeling now.  There is, as before, outside seating on the south side of the restaurant.

But it&#39;s all about the food.  I was hungry and asked the server for guidance between the Chicken Riganato or the Citrus-Seared Pork Chops (3).  She recommended the chops, and am I glad she did.

Dinner began with warm, crusty bread which we devoured (and asked for seconds).

When dinner arrived, my chops were grilled just perfectly and very moist, and served in a wonderful sauce of herbs, tomatoes and white wine reduction.  I got the lemon-oregano roasted potatoes as a side and they were perfectly done and quite tasty.  The iced tea was very flavorful (not the bland stuff that comes out of the soda dispenser).  My wife had the Wild Atlantic Salmon; it was as good as any other place but not distinguished in any way and lacked any grilled flavor.  The others in our party had Tortellini Alla Panna (a sample bite was very tasty) and the char-broiled pork chops (also 3).  His chops were perfectly grilled and he was quite pleased with the flavor and doneness.

After dinner we shared two small servings of Tiramasu and Red Velvet cake; both were very tasty.

The tab for four dinners, dessert and refreshments (no alcohol) was about $75 with tax.

A &#34;heads up&#34; that the sandwiches are VERY reasonably priced, so we&#39;ll definitely return to try lunch.  The dinners we had are pricey enough to be reserved for special occasions, but it&#39;s nice to have such good quality so close by and we are eager to return and try other selections.

riganato-old-world-grille-geneva,Ryan H.,8_KZjp0X5BLyMH3_Cuiezw,e0_i5Fi8Y7hhTBN9d7qFtw,"We stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant while searching for a place for dinner with some friends.  The menu looked decent, the prices seemed fair, but the reviews were a bit mixed.  In the end, the good reviews plead their case well and we decided to give it a shot.  Suffice to say, I am very glad we did.  

It was nighttime and on our first pass, we drove right by, not even recognizing that this spot was the location where the old Rib House was a number of years back.  

We walked in the front door and I was actually quite surprised that the restaurant is incredibly small.  I was expecting a much larger venue.  Perhaps 11 or 12 tables in all, and every one of them seemed full.  Figuring that a lengthy wait was in our future, I inquired with the hostess to see how long of a wait it would be.  I was quite happy when she said probably no more than 5 minutes.  In less than that time, we were seated at a nice table adjacent to the fireplace.  

Menus were presented, water glasses were filled, and white linen napkins were available.  All good so far.  

The menu contains a very diverse selection, from steaks to seafood, pizzas and burgers.  Prices are very reasonable.  The drink list was on the reverse side of the menu and contained an assortment of cocktails, wine and beer.  I felt the drink prices were a bit on the high side, so I opted for an iced tea.  I don&#39;t mind enjoying a cocktail or a glass of wine with dinner, but I know liquor costs quite well and if the prices are too high, I let it sit on the shelf.  

Our table ordered an assortment of different menu items so that we would have a variety of items to try.  A salad, a pizza, steak kebabs and a pork tenderloin were among the items we chose.  

I did not try the salad, but it looked fresh and crisp and there were no complaints.  I ordered the steak kebabs which came with french fries and tzatziki sauce.  Knowing that the average kitchen usually over-fires kebabs because the veggies take longer than the meat, I ordered mine medium rare and planned on accepting the dish if it arrived medium.  Sure enough, they came out very medium.  I wasn&#39;t overly upset about it and they still tasted just fine, but just be aware that if you are expecting your beef at a certain temperature, you may want to consider ordering one temperature lower.  In any case, the flavor was very good and the tzatziki sauce was obviously homemade (which I later verified).  

I tried the pork tenderloin and found it to be excellent.  It came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes which were equally delicious.  

I also tried a piece of the pizza and found it to be terrific as well.  Thin cracker crust and the toppings all had good flavor.  

The dessert tray came around and I chose a rice pudding.  Another member of our party chose the tiramisu.  I was a little bit disappointed that they did not have any whipped cream for the rice pudding.  Fortunately, the rice pudding was obviously made in house and was still very good, but would have been better with some whipped cream.  

About half way through our dinner, the place cleared out, rather abruptly I might add.  It seems that they have a rather busy dinner hour and then it gets a bit quiet.  If you can dine at off hours, you will likely walk right in and be seated.  If you arrive at a busy time, I could see where a wait could be possible. 

Ordinarily, I would give them five stars, but I am withholding that last star for a couple of minor reasons, all of which are easily remedied if management chooses to do so:

1.My iced tea was cloudy, which is one of my pet peeves.  If they don&#39;t cool the iced tea properly, it will be cloudy, and sure enough, cloudy it was.

2.I felt the portion size of our meals was a bit small.  They could easily raise the price of the meals by $1 across the board and lower the bar menu a little bit to balance things out.  It would have been nice if the kebabs were served with a nice rice pilaf or something.  As it was, I received just one smallish kebab, a few fries and a side of tzatziki.  I couldn&#39;t help but notice a lot of vacant real estate on my plate when it arrived tableside.  Further, if the drinks were priced a bit better, I would have had a cocktail or two.  

3.Rice pudding should always be served with whipped cream, or at least it should be available upon request.  As it was, there was allegedly no whipped cream in the restaurant. 

4.The menu is a piece of legal sized paper, printed on both sides.  I felt the paper menu sort of cheapens an otherwise excellent, quasi-elegant experience.  

On the plus side, the food was excellent.  The service was excellent.  The menu is diverse.  The meals were prepared in a timely fashion.  The staff was most friendly.  And for having such a surprisingly small dining room, the ambiance, complete with fireplace, was very warm and inviting.  

You really owe it to yourself to give this little gem in Geneva a try.  I will certainly be back sooner rather than later.",30/12/12,572,4,2,5,41,12.575000000000001,7.838000000000001,1.345,48.817999999999984,No,5010

It&#39;s also nice to have a restaurant of its caliber on the East Side of Geneva. Not much at all to write home about east of the river, restaurant-wise.

Mom, Dad and I went to Riganato for a Thanksgiving eve dinner, and it was excellent. Being a resident of Chicago, the affordable prices were a welcome change of pace for me.

My mom had the huge meatballs, and loved them. Dad ate the pork tenderloin and mushrooms, and I went for the spaghetti with mussels. Delicious all around. Also got a great bottle of red for a reasonable $22.

What we appreciated the most was the personal attention we received. The waitress, the manager and the chef all stopped by at different times to ask how we enjoyed our meal. And then the waitstaff allowed us to take our time, continue conversing, and finish our wine while the rest of the restaurant was closing down.

The son was very polite and the woman that was working there offered me a chair to sit on while we were waiting in the lobby.

Based on the recommendations from Yelp, I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The food was absolutely delicious. However, simple touches of asking if you&#39;d like parmesan cheese would be welcomed. My friend ordered the tortellini with grilled chicken breast. Since we were going to split the items, our server kindly offered to do this for us in the kitchen. It arrived in two separate bowls - how wonderful. The food portions are generous. 

My first bite of pasta and meatballs was absolutely divine. The tortellini was just as wonderful and the cream sauce was light and flavorful. The food passing our table looked just as inviting, especially the pizza, hamburgers, salads and lasagna. 

The hostess/owner was warm and gracious, as was the servers. We ended our meal with the small taste of red velvet cake. It was also delicious and just the right amount of sweet. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get too.

My husband and I tried them for the first time at Geneva&#39;s Festival of the Vine.  They are huge, like the size of a billiard ball, and stuffed with ricotta cheese.  Oh, they are delectable and the marinara they&#39;re in is fantastic.

Riganato&#39;s is an old home renovated into a restaurant. The outside is meant to represent the Mediterranean with pink stucco siding.  Inside, it&#39;s homey and warm with about 10 tables, many of which were filled when we dined on a Thursday night.

The servers all seemed very friendly.  You get bread right away (ours came with a previously opened butter package, however).  We got the meatballs to start and they were to die for all over again.

I got the evening&#39;s special for my meal.  It was a penne pasta with salmon and capers, and it was just okay.  My husband got the tortellini with chicken, and the cream sauce was pretty bland.  For dessert we split a tiny (tiny!) piece of cake.

The price was decent: just over $60 for an appetizer, a bottle of wine, two entrees, and a small dessert.  We decided that next time we go (because we will go again) we will get the meatballs for sure, and then for our meals we will each get the spaghetti with the stuffed meatballs!

Overall, we had a very good experience.  The newly remolded restaurant looked great, especially as the &#39;Rib House&#39; which was at this location previously was showing its age.

We were seated right away,  really enjoyed the outside seating option.  

Bread was brought right away and was piping hot!  Unfortunately the butter was in the plastic (peal off top) type and was rock hard.

We ordered soft-drinks which were pricy, but included free refills.  We ordered the Saganaki as an appetizer... The waitress set it ablaze and then tried to immediately put out the flame with the lemon juice.   This left a lot of Alcohol left on the dish and it was a bit &#39;wet&#39; with alcohol.  I prefer mine to burn off a bit more.  The Saganaki was tasty, and was crispy on top... but had no form.  it was if it had melted away underneath the top.

I ordered the special, which was a portobello and cheese stuffed ravioli with marinara sauce and broccoli florets.  The marinara tasted AMAZING!  The broccoli was just fantastic... the protobello and cheese tasted very good, but was cold inside the ravioli.

Ordered dessert and I had the rice pudding.  It was pretty middle of the road, but satisfying.

Locals watched as slowly the run down facade of the restaurant took shape and excitedly, we waited for the new place. Those of us close to the Rib House were eager to see Riganato. We went the first night, knowing there would be some kinks and issues. 
The service moved like molasses and not because of first night jitters, they looked like there was just no fire under them to hurry. If your familiar with the building, its a very small place, there&#39;s not a lot of tables. But they didn&#39;t seem to be rushed or apologetic in any way for the delays. It took about 15 minutes for a waiter to come to our table. Our drinks took about 15 minutes. Dinner took about 20-25 minutes, and getting the check and paying took a surprising 15 minutes. For burgers, dinner lasted 2 full hours.
I decided to play it safe on the food and ordered a blue cheese burger. it was fine - I couldnt taste the meat, it lacked seasoning, but I love the flavor of bluecheese and there was plenty of that. The fries were soggy. 
My husband ordered the horseradish burger. he said it was flavorless. His fries were also soggy.
Our friends ordered a the Marie G pizza (I believe it was called that?) and the &#34;chicken&#34; on the pizza was actually lunchmeat!! So weird! Flavorless, too. The other friend ordered tortellini - they definately had that store bought bland quality and the sauce was rich and flavorless. 
Ok, So i can forgive the lack of flavor in the food - the kitchen is probably getting used to cooking the menu. one would assume it will improve.

But what will actually keep us from ever returning is the owner&#39;s lack of responsbility and welcome to the patrons who were not her friends and family. For the entire evening I watched the owner chat with tables she clearly new on a personal level and for a good chunk of time they sat with what I believe was immediate family - at a table. I spilled an entire glass of water on the table - the clutz I am, and though its noone&#39;s responsbility to clean it but my own, it went unacknowledged by any staff member until we flagged down the &#34;bread and water&#34; guy who didn&#39;t understand I needed towels to soak the water up and at first brought us linen napkins (which dont absorb anything). Finally, he brought the towels and I was able to clean it up. The owner was just two tables down from us and I felt a little surprised that she didnt acknowledge or offer to help. 
Later in our evening another family she knew came in with a baby a little younger than my own. While my baby&#39;s carseat sat on the floor the whole time while I held her, the owner immeidately offered a high chair flipped over where the carseat for her friend could sit - I was never offered assistance for my child. 
I guess I could try to forgive all of that, but the overall lack of acknowledgement for those patrons that they weren&#39;t familair with was an indication of poor business practice to me. I expected at a grand opening that the owner of the place would greet everyone and check in on the tables (especially since there arent that many!) But we never met her or her husband. I was insulted that it appeared to me that her friends and family were more important. My husband was familair with the old Rib House and looked forward to talking with the new owners. They just never came over to say hello.",19/04/12,370,1,1,5,-21,7.034800000000001,3.643,1.4809999999999999,31.87599999999999,No,3482

My husband and I looked at each other and I accidentally said seriously out loud. The place was not even half full.  I do know and understand that restaurants may have a policy about seating reservations at the time of the reservation - but if that is/was the case, we should have been told.  We&#39;d have had no problem getting a drink at the bar.  The bartender walked over, made a couple of changes and the hostess got snippy and mad at him.  Two minutes later we were seated.

After we were seated, it took 25 minutes before a server acknowledged us.  We were just about to get up and put our coats on when she came by.  She apologized numerous times, and blamed the hostess for not letting her know that she had our table.  The server went even further and gave us edamame on the house.

We will continue to go to the Hoffman Estates location, but not this location.",20/01/16,191,3,1,1,-52,0.7112999999999993,1.78,1.161,23.059,No,1729

It&#39;s a super delicious place but also very expensive! Dining for 4...we will end up with a $300+ bill. Dining for 10 would be almost be around $700! All their food is expensive but it&#39;s well worth it. A few of my favorites...

Appetizers.......
Asparagus beef: Asparagus wrapped in beef! It&#39;s really flavorful, you can taste the beef, it&#39;s sauce and asparagus very well! All food should be like that!
Fried Shrimp: it&#39;s really good! Baked in fresh oil, super crispy! Downfall is that it only comes with 4 pieces, about 3/4&#34; long and $10+. When I&#39;m here with family, kids usually eat about 6 plates of it!
Crabcakes: They&#39;re beyond amazing! In a sucker for crab cakes. Extremely picky but there&#39;s are really good! Small portion but very buttery and flavorful. 

Entrees.....
Alaskan king crab salad: I was skittle disappointed in this dish. There was barely any crab and for $18, smaller than a size of a baseball. It was a total rip off! It&#39;s one thing my family and I won&#39;t ever order again especially for the price tag. It taste almost like a seafood salad with imitation crab meat from subway. 
Rack of lamb: omgggg their lamb is extremely good! Very easy to eat. Almost fall off the bone. It&#39;s very flavorful, not gamey at all. 


Sushi.......
Baja roll: this one is pretty good! It&#39;s a spicy turn almost Mexican style! 
Philly: it&#39;s very creamy! But you can also taste the salmon at the same time!
Spicy tuna: a classic for all sushi joints, this is one of the best places for spicy tuna. 
Crazy roll: it&#39;s literally crazy looking. It&#39;s good but does have a whole bunch of raw fish thrown on top. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to distinguish which first is what since its all jumbo in and on the roll.

Overall, it&#39;s a good sushi place! It can be very expensive! It&#39;s not a big restaurant so expect to wait. Especially on weekends. They do take reservations so that&#39;s a plus. They also have limited hours! Very beautiful inside! They have a full bar you can sit at too!",16/04/15,261,4,2,5,31,7.033100000000001,6.588,1.6710000000000003,32.741,No,2103

 The sushi is amazingly fresh, and extremely well done.  If they have lobster maki on the specials menu, try it!  It is expensive, but soooooo worth it.  Also if they have king crab nigiri, try that too!  It melts on your tongue and is very sweet.  We actually like to have it for dessert!

Like everyone said, very modern looking interior. I wholeheartedly agree with Valerie B&#39;s review: the chopsticks were cheap. My younger cousin and I spent several minutes entertaining ourselves by picking at the splintered wood. 

I was going to give one star for the food; however, I wanted to tack on one more for the martinis. They were served in some of the biggest martini glasses I&#39;ve seen thus far and tasted great. I hate tasting the alcohol in mixed drinks, but these tasted like juice. I can&#39;t clearly recall the names so bear with me. I had the mongo mango one and all the girls liked mine the most. Another girl had some white cranberry (or was it raspberry?) one. I remember that one tasted a little sour, mmm. The only martini that was super strong was the sake one the maid of honor got. The martinis didn&#39;t touch me, but the bride was having fun after drinking two. I even downed mine fast. I suppose being in college has turned my liver into a champ. I wish I could&#39;ve seen the bill to see how much the martinis are, but the maid of honor grabbed it before anyone could take a peek.

The waitress took so long to come back and get our food order. We got worried that she assumed all we wanted were martinis. The sushi was.. ehh. Not really memorable. It&#39;s just all your typical rolls and what is it again with this $4 for one piece of hamachi?! Is this just how sushi is done in Illinois? I wanted to order one because my theory is that you can get a real feel for the caliber of the restaurant&#39;s sushi by their quality of yellowtail. I ended up not being able to order it because our waitress took our orders and disappeared so fast that I didn&#39;t have the time to register that I didn&#39;t even order it. I&#39;m glad that I decided against ordering nigiri in the end because  all the fish in the rolls tasted the same. It&#39;s a sad day when you can&#39;t discern salmon from tuna based on taste alone. 

The girl that was the one who took us to this place kept ranting and raving about their spicy tuna roll. I cringed inside when she went ahead and ordered three rolls for our group of 5. Not really a fan since I found out that some restaurants will mash up the bad parts of tuna in order to make their spicy tuna. The bride did comment on how it had chunks of tuna instead of being the usual super fine fare. I couldn&#39;t taste the soft shell crab in the spider roll.

Lastly, some of their patrons suck. I know it&#39;s not the restaurant&#39;s fault so I didn&#39;t take that into account when rating the place.The fact that a table of OC housewife wannabes were glaring at us because we took three pictures is laughable. You&#39;re eating mediocre sushi at a restaurant located in a strip mall nowhere near Newport. Get over yourself.",17/06/10,312,2,1,5,10,4.1112,2.9419999999999997,1.41,30.648,No,2867
bistro-wasabi-lake-in-the-hills,Ryan S.,loFFoAyxFdVkw4R3Xe9MpQ,E3YHvpFSc2twKhh_ctPEkw,"I&#39;ve been to Bistro Wasabi so many times that I have lost count, but thought I should share why it&#39;s probably my favorite restaurant.

The freshness to their sushi is astonishing. And it&#39;s consistently this way. As the word has spread throughout suburbia on how good their quality of food is, they&#39;ve never wavered to accommodate volume or try to stretch a buck. Their portions are larger than most sushi I&#39;ve had at other places and far better too.

Sure, a drawback for some is their location. A restaurant in a strip mall doesn&#39;t always sound all that appealing, but I assure you that once you step inside, you&#39;ll forget all about that. The bar is the first thing to convene on you. It&#39;s well-lit, stylish and is its own island; stationed in between the main dining area, the sushi bar itself, and a wonderfully Japanese-esque side wing where the warm blue lighting transports you somewhere Far East and far away from a suburban strip mall.  If there&#39;s room, I like to conquer a stool up at the bar and declare war on some fish. The usual suspect running the show behind the bar is a very knowledgeable gentleman named Dean. Make friends with him and he will take very, very good care of you. He always has exceptional recommendations into their specials, wine...you name it.

I usually order off their sashimi and maki menu.  For the novice, they have wonderful California, and Philly rolls. Also, their Dragon, Rainbow and (off the menu; you have to ask for it) Godzilla rolls are fantastic ways to try a variety of their food. One of these orders is perfectly proportioned for two people to share. 

As I&#39;ve become more adventurous in raw seafood, I really dig the sea urchin, flying fish roe, and eel nigiri. The sea urchin is so unsullied and buttery and rich, you begin to think there&#39;s an ocean in the back of this joint. 

A couple of other suggestions to try would be the Pineapple roll (tempura shrimp, with pineapple, cucumber, cilantro, lime, avocado, and a spicy pico de gallo) and, if they have it, the Lobster maki (Asian spices, cucumber, roe). The portions are huge--good luck getting an entire one into your mouth on a single bite. But, suggestions don&#39;t even matter. Everything they put in front of you is wonderful and clean, and you will clean your plate. You&#39;ll leave full, but not like when you leave your Aunts house on Thanksgiving. 

If you want to have a nice dinner date or a small gathering with friends, Bistro Wasabi is a perfect spot. The confines are cozy, the vibe is always upbeat and the food is divine.",05/02/12,302,4,3,5,60,8.1393,3.9450000000000003,0.9989999999999999,21.056000000000004,No,2594

We had the crab ragoon sushi which was delicious.

I had the New York strip for dinner and it was outstanding.  Just enough fat to give it flavor and cooked to perfection.  I had sake with my meal and they have a very nice selection to choose from on their menu.

Seriously. It&#39;s that impressive. 

To be really honest, it&#39;s not that impressive at first. You wonder how good it could possibly be since it&#39;s located in a strip mall. You walk inside, and it&#39;s absolutely mobbed, and you most likely will grumble about the wait. You try to get a drink at the bar, but the bar is surrounded by people, 3 to 4 deep, all trying their valiant best to get the attention of the overworked bartenders who are all churning out colorful drinks like there is no tomorrow. You take a look around you and realize that everyone is yuppie and this could easily be mistaken for a scene right out of River North save for that forlorn farm field right down the road. 

Then you get seated, wait for some more, and then realize that everything that you have thought was just superfluous. Because no other sushi place even comes CLOSE to this one. 

Make sure you try the asparagus beef roll, any of the tuna, the nigiri, and the tempura. If you have room, go for the Godzilla. But in the end, you honestly can&#39;t go wrong with any of the sushi. It&#39;s always fresh and decadent. And you&#39;re left wondering just how they get all of this fresh seafood.",06/03/09,141,5,1,4,10,3.8150000000000004,2.4259999999999997,1.488,11.086,No,1366

We also had a special called dynamite the other night and it was sooo good. It&#39;s a mixture of some thin noodles, lobster pieces, shrimp, crab, and scallops all mixed in a spicy cream sauce. The plate is served on fire (seriously) which adds to the effect. As far as the sushi goes, I love the dragon roll and Sapporo.  If you like spicy sushi ask for the Sapporo extra hot or 911.

Definitely make reservations, it gets crowded. We had a reservation for 8:15 and still had to wait, that&#39;s how busy it gets on a Friday night. We loved everything we tried. The shrimp tempura was really good. We tried the Lobster roll, Spicy Tuna, California, Cucumber veggie roll, and Bistro wasabi rolls.  All were really good. However, the place was extremely loud! It was romantic and we had a great time but it&#39;s not easy to communicate at a normal volume. The waitress was very friendly and service was relatively quick.  The ambiance is nice and they had upbeat music playing. It was kind of hard to believe we were in a small strip mall in Lake in the Hills.  It was a little pricey though...all said and done a meal for 2 people was over $75 not including tip.

We will go back and try the Crab Rangoon and maybe nigiri!",04/02/12,110,4,2,3,16,2.9842000000000004,2.601,0.236,11.164000000000001,No,910

This restaurant was the location of my first sushi experience back when I was in high school, so it always holds a special place in my heart.  

I have had some funky sushi in Chicago, and not in a good way.  So, I&#39;m always pleased when fish is fresh.  I have to say that Bistro Wasabi has fish so fresh it would rival any of the high-end sushi establishments in Chicago.

One of my absolute favorite things at BW is the tempura calamari.  The calamari are &#34;tempuraed&#34; calamari steaks in a sweet sesame soy glaze.  They are stacked like logs and absolutely fantastic.  We also had edamame  and ceviche with corn and mango which was really flavorful and unique.  I&#39;ve never had corn in ceviche before, but it really created a fresh, light flavor to the ceviche.

I had the special sushi which was shrimp, avocado, cream cheese with habanero masago and crunchy tempura flakes, and boy was it spicy.  But it was so delicious and interesting.  I had another maki which was tuna with avocado and pico de gallo.  Delicious.

Some of our dining companions got &#34;the boat&#34; for 2.  Which was 2 different maki rolls, a ton os sashimi, and a ton of nigiri.  The boat is actually served in a boat (I&#39;ve seen this other places, but nowhere is the boat as large as it is at BW.  There was everything from octopus to tuna to shrimp to fluke.  Everything was beautiful

I think it&#39;s going to be hard for other places (yes, even city places) to live up to it.  I was in a party of five.  Three of us ate sushi, one had crab cakes and teriyake skewers and one, the non-fish eater had the steak.  We ALL were able to enjoy our food and I was lucky enough to get a teeny tasting of the steak and crab cakes and they were great.  

We had edamame and the beef asparagus rolls for appetizers and for someone who doesn&#39;t like asparagus, I don&#39;t know what they did to it to make it taste SO good.  

But the sushi, that&#39;s what you really have to have at this place.  Since I love roe, I had the salmon roe with the quail egg.  I thought...what the heck!  How often do I get the chance to try a raw quail egg... hehehe.  It was good too!  We shared 6 different kinds of rolls and there were only two I wasn&#39;t crazy about.  The Godzilla was great until I got a taste of the wasabi.  Eeeeek, I&#39;d forgotten how much I DON&#39;T like wasabi.  So I just ate around it.  And then there was a spicy one I wasn&#39;t crazy about, so I just ate the others, The California roll, one with eel, and others I can&#39;t remember.  ALL great.

And to end the meal we had the mochi (?), ice-cream balls with bean paste.  Yummy.  

With 2 orders of saki around the table, the bill came to just uner $200....and for 5 people, that isn&#39;t bad.  I know sushi can get real expensive, real quick, so I was pleased at the price.  I&#39;ll definitely go back to Bistro Wasabi, and next time I&#39;ll sit at the sushi bar.",02/07/07,195,4,1,5,5,7.109100000000001,5.1209999999999996,0.539,17.34,No,1615

One of the other reviews mentioned the Godzilla roll.  That is a great roll but they have several other fusion type rolls which are even more amazing.  The &#34;Crab Rangoon Roll&#34; it is Alaskan crab meat, and some other type of crab I can&#39;t remember right now, with cream cheese, and rice obviously.  But then they take it to a anew level.  They tempura fry the whole roll before the slice it up.  It comes out out and tastes better than any crab rangoon you have ever had.  It is 8 pieces huge pieces and only costs $16.

My recommendation go with 3 friends and order no less than 8-10 rolls.

The owners and staff are super polite to even friendly, the decor is pretty chic for a strip mall across from corn fields all the way out in LITH and the sushi....well...

The sushi is great!  Fresh large cuts of fish (although they do tend to run out of certain kinds later on in the night) for your standard sushi/sashimi.  I know it&#39;s dorky, but when I go with my parent&#39;s we&#39;ll order the sushi love boat (or whatever it&#39;s called) and it&#39;s plenty for the 3 of us and I&#39;m very very piggish.  

The chef also does a lot of creative appetizers, not typical of a Japanese restaurant (but they are all Korean so...) but more typical of a big city place serving a nuevo-Sushi-cuisine.  Either way, the creative-nuevo apps are tasty, innovative, and definitely hearty...none of that amuse bouche small portions with foam and a dollop of caviar crap.

Dinner for two, with one drink each and tip was $100, which, for the big picture visit we didn&#39;t find to be a great value.  Having said that, I should note that portions are large - we ordered what seemed appropriate for 2 people, but could have done with half.  
The Tempura Calamari appetizer was *great*.   We had a variety plate of sushi and of sashemi, which were very similar and overall a little bland with several different items tasting the same.  Oustanding however was the smoked eel.  (Yum!)
There was a language issue, with our waitress (who was very nice) not being able to understand what we were asking.  
Timing of the meal was a problem.  We were still eating our appetizers when soup arrived - we felt rushed.  Then, we had a long wait between the soup and the entree.  It would have been better to have had each course more appropriately spread out.  
Decor was well done - you never felt you were sitting in a room in a strip mall, though hubby and I had to switch seats due to very cold breeze from a/c at our table.

bistro-wasabi-lake-in-the-hills,colleen p.,rvf5TPkoDZ5kr0rTeVMjLA,WJABgkP1kJ1mknL7JQC_Bw,"this is my favorite sushi place in the entire world.  i used to work there and believe me, a good portion of my paychecks went towards sushi.  

the original bistro wasabi is tucked away in an unassuming strip mall in the sleepy town of lake in the hills.  unfortunately, its easy to pass by without knowing its even there.  however, once inside the doors, you quickly forget that you&#39;re in the far northwest &#39;burbs.  the interior is sleek, modern and minimalist.  techno is usually pumping through the speakers and there is a busy and upbeat vibe that makes you feel like you&#39;re in the heart of the city.

everything on their menu is incredibly delicious...from the sushi to the salads to the entrees, you simply can&#39;t go wrong with any of the selections.  i&#39;m an admitted sashimi snob.  if its not super-fresh i won&#39;t eat it.  over the years, bistro has spoiled me to the point where i can&#39;t eat sashimi in most other restaurants.  the only sashimi i&#39;ve had that was as fresh as bistros was on the west coast.  in my opinion, few (if any) restuarants in the midwest can touch the quality and flavor of the fish that bistro serves.  my all-time favorites are the salmon and yellowtail.  i usually need a moment of quiet while i&#39;m eating them.  heh.

for non-sushi people, there are plenty of great dishes to choose from.  i highly recommend the beef asparagus roll (an appetizer, but big enough for a regular entree) and either the grilled salmon or hibachi steak with vegetables.  jeffrey&#39;s special salad is also delicious, but there are pieces of raw fish in it.

last but not least, dean the bartender rocks.  his martinis are the stuff that dreams are made of.  he&#39;s there every night except tuesday...be sure to stop by the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail.

weekends can be busy, so its a good idea to call ahead for reservations.  overall, its definitely worth the drive, but if you can&#39;t make it to lake in the hills, check out bistro 2 at 1758 w. algonquin rd. in hoffman estates.  same menu, similar strip mall, not as far.",23/12/06,235,5,1,5,-10,4.6379,2.8110000000000004,1.818,21.369999999999997,No,2079

The staff was very apologetic and the young man that cooked it came to our table later and said that he just wanted to apologize again for the burger and was very gracious.  We were very happy with the customer service and food.  I&#39;ll be back.

Prices were pretty reasonable as well.   A meal of a burger, fries, and a drink was less than $10.  Not bad.  I can truly say this beats any gas station hot dog sitting on a roller for 12 hours!",19/05/16,145,5,2,5,11,4.4981,3.622,0.454,16.924,No,1219

Was eager and united to answer their bacon burger is their best seller, so I settled for that, added $1.99 for drinks and fries. Good drink selection from a digital dispenser, I thought that was cool. My order came and was notified  that the bacon is hot. So I finished the fries first. Fries aren&#39;t crispy, I don&#39;t care, but I think it&#39;s cooked in bacon fat, yummy. Burger was handsome with the nice looking, shiny brioche. Tall because of the stacked bacon, fried onion ring  and the half pounder meat. It was garnished with roasted jalapeÌ±o so be prepared. I had to pace myself because it stings but not over power the experience.

urban-counter-aurora,Nicole W.,qlC607Cyp0Mj91vDFvkp3Q,Wss5NprqTqGMqxODwZm6-g,"I spent a good deal of time driving around Butterfield Road looking for Urban Counter. And making u-turns. And trying to (safely) cross traffic. I finally realized that Urban Counter is physically inside the BP Gas Station. So, word to the wise! 

I placed a to-go order and was told my food would be ready in about 15-20 minutes so I was a bit surprised when I arrived 25 minutes later that it was still about 5-10 min out. No biggie, though, I filled up my tank and waited in the (very) clean BP. The food was all made fresh by a few friendly guys at a cute little counter next to a smattering of tables. We ordered eats for a variety of folks, from grilled cheese to burgers, sandwiches to fries and here&#39;s how we made out...

Fries: 3/5: I prefer a crispy fry and this was lacking in crisp and salt. Points for being freshly fried. I appreciate the sweet potato option, though. 
BLT: 3/5: Huge and made with thick cut bacon. Flavorful but the bacon was a bit chewy (again, would prefer more crisp) and the avocado was teeny tiny. 
Portions: 4/5: Even item I ordered offered super hearty portions. You will not go hungry. 
Execution: 3/5: I ordered fruit cups and they were forgotten. Bummer. That and considering the longer time to ready my food, I give execution a 3/5. 

I love the concept of a freshly made burger, especially with such a convenient slant. If the execution was ramped up a bit, I can see Urban Counter being a go-to!",09/08/16,191,3,1,5,-38,4.21,2.862,1.506,15.632000000000001,No,1443

I only get 40 minute max work breaks and this place is 10+ minutes away so I called ahead today (which I had to do twice, no answer or message the first time) for a signature bleu cheese burger combo. When I arrived, it hadn&#39;t even been started though. So while I ordered it mid-rare, I started pacing around nervously a few minutes into him cooking it and he changed it to to-go packaging. I sat down there and ate it anyway as intended and it was damn near raw in the middle. But I took a chance and my existence seems okay so far...

Urban Counter makes big  1/2 lb pub style burgers. I&#39;ve had the bbq bacon cheese and it was good but overcooked last time. Today&#39;s was undercooked but that&#39;s half my fault...and it was still delicious with bleu cheese, bacon, caramelized onions and arugula. Fries are fresh cut style and quite tasty but can be on the wilted/soggy side like today.

I had the giant breakfast burrito once and it was fab! With sausage, egg, onion, peppers, cheese and some other goodness. Easily splittable and only $4?!

I said I was waiting for my boss who drove seperately. He was in the car on the phone. The minute he came in they all gave him a hard time about being on the phone and were laughing. He laughed too! These ladies were fun! Eventually we finally ordered. Had the turkey burger w/ full accompaniments with  veggies minus  mayo but plus avacado. My friend had the bacon burger. The ladies were very patient as we kidded them about everything. They like to have fun and are good at making customers feel at ease. Food came quickly. Burgers were great, sweet potatoes fries were good! I liked the drink machine which has a ton of beverage choices. Service was very good. Prices were very reasonable.

Farnsworth.  Great food, great service, low prices and the three amigos ( ladies who work hard, do a good job and also have fun and laugh their ass off!  Totally worth the stop.

I stopped in to pick up some food for my boss and I. She got the BLT w/ small fries...man the bacon was thick and the avocado even thicker! It looked delicious and got a thumbs up from my boss. I ordered a burger thinking...its the most simple thing they have so lets start there. It was delicious! And big. They weren&#39;t kidding that it was a half pound burger. I&#39;m so glad i ordered a small fry and no drink because I was stuffed after that meal. The burger wasn&#39;t dry at all and I always order mine well done (which can sometimes be really dry). The fries were pretty good. They are fried with the skin...fyi for those who don&#39;t like their fries like that.

I was extremely skeptical, but I decide to give this place a shot. I decided to order the half pound bacon cheeseburger, order of sweet potato fries and a 20 ounce drink. All of that together was under $10 with tax. Burger places coming go, but let me paint a picture of what the burger looked like. The burgers are made to order, the patties are hand pressed, and are half pound (we realized later that you can order mini-burgers if the half pound is too big). The burger is on a toasted brioche bun, the meat was perfectly seasoned, and the bacon is thick cut. Once they brought the burger out, I was blown away at the presentation of the burger (remember, this is a gas station) for what I paid for it. Most places would charge you $13 for the burger I ordered.  I finished my burger in minutes because it was one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had. This place is a gem within a gas station.

I ate a REAL half-pound burger, one of the BEST I&#39;ve ever had, made-to-order... in a gas station.  From the graphic design on the menu to the execution, yummy flavor, and unexpected location, it was a joyful experience.

It didn&#39;t matter that this restaurant was located in a gas station:  Our food was brought to our table, and we really felt as though we were dining out in the best possible fast food scenario.  

The folks who made our meal were clearly proud of their work, and we could taste the love in every bite.  My husband ordered the blue cheese burger and a strawberry milkshake.  His shake tasted of fresh strawberries, and his burger was literally perfect, with the exception of (in my opinion) too-sweet bacon.  I ordered the bacon burger (opting for spicy mustard + mayo instead of the BBQ sauce called for on the menu).  I made it a combo meal with fries and a drink (loved the frozen Coke option).  My burger was close-to-perfect (the sweet bacon was a small disappointment), and I LOVED the jalapeno spread and onion rings as toppings.

After finishing my workout at the neighboring hotel I decided I wanted to have something light to finish up the evening. I reviewed the menu here and it sounded like it had some decent choices, so I went. I started off with the beet salad and that was my first mistake. It not only took them 45 minutes to get me my beet salad (Were they roasting the beats to order?) but when the salad came to the table the &#34;balsamic syrup drizzle&#34; was more like a &#34;balsamic syrup WATERFALL&#34;. Yikes! After scraping away the waterfall disaster I tried one of the beats. That was my second mistake. The wrinkly, overcooked and squishy beat was not appetizing what so ever! I decided to stop with the salad at that point. Next for dinner was the Roasted Artichoke Ravioli. This only took them 30 minutes. We can call this my 3rd mistake... The ravioli was filled with a mushy textured undecipherable puree and then covered with canned artichoke hearts, un-rehydrated sundried tomatoes and the worst textured pesto I have ever had in my life. It had a texture almost like peanut butter. There was no way I was going to try a dessert.

My gf and I had a date night package through the Hilton so dinner was included. They had the best caesar salad I&#39;ve ever had! I even asked our waiter if I could but the dressing but he said they make their own so I was outta luck. Next i had the filet medallions with shrimps on top of them and my gf had the stuffed salmon. Both of our entrees were deeeeeeeelish! They actually made a mistake on my order and gave me 3 filet medallions instead of 2 so it was even better! Yummmmmmy! The steaks were soft and tender just how i like it. Lastly we had the passion fruit creme brulee and praline ice cream for dessert. I really enjoyed my creme brulee and the only reason i couldnt finish it was cuz i ate my entire entree. Our waiter (i think his name was Dale) was super friendly and funny too! He made excellent recommendations and gave us wonderful service! Will DEFINITELY come back here!,13/09/10,112,5,2,5,35,5.4011,2.944,0.23299999999999998,10.820999999999998,No,1020

Our simple questions seemed an irritation to her.  We had to call our first waiter over to get us drinks. Eventually our waitress came over and took our order.

shiraz-on-the-water-bloomingdale,Jessica G.,I9d4lrN8p7a9TfN6yU10Vw,9iS94cQfGqrDkjkuPMj3_Q,"Shiraz was less than mediocre.  I was expecting fine dining being that its with the Hilton resort and from a quick peruse of the menu online.  The appetizer we ordered was the king crab rolls.  Fresh from the frig these tastless rolls were served with an overpowering sauce.  Whomever cooked the rice was clever enough to make it both over and under cooked.  The bread course came with four topping options served in a candle holder.  Butter, garlic butter, tapenade (very dry), and hummus were the options.  The hummus/tapenade combo made me think of 
someone wearing stripes and polka dots at the same time.  We all know 
this only works for clowns so I can only assume our chef was busy making balloon animals instead of watching our food cook.  The jokes continued with my entree.  The mashed potatoes were so thick that I could lift them all at once with my fork and they still held their oddly extruded shape.  My husband had a chicken dish that was covered with a think slab of cheese hiding the bones and gristle that lay in wait underneath.  His meal was also served with cafeteria potato triangles.  Tasty but not classy.  I do love a good juxtaposition but this missed the mark.  Dessert was microwaved bread pudding with ice cream and a giant spun sugar disk.  Perhaps the giant disk was a visual prepared by our clown chef meant to warn us like a sugary stop sign.  Did I mention my iced tea was from a powder mix? I was so shocked that they couldn&#39;t be bothered to brew a tea.  61 dollars and 2 hours of mine lost forever at the Shiraz big top.",16/10/09,177,1,1,1,-17,0.44579999999999986,1.499,1.3359999999999999,17.165000000000003,No,1562

Asked waiter to take our dinner order right away because we had plans for the evening. He took our orders and then we waited. Soup and salad were served after about 15 minutes.  And then the long wait began. After having been seated for an hour and forty minutes, we called over the front of the house person and requested that our orders be cancelled and we be given the check. Not surprisingly, our food appeared out of the kitchen. Cold where it should have been hot, plates just kind of thrown together. After the long wait, we were rushed through our meal, no apologies were given and we were promptly presented the bill. One in our party had convinced the rest of us to stay put and wait to be served, or we would have and should have left. Terrible service, kitchen can only have been total chaos.

We were thoroughly impressed by the deep dish artichoke pizza, as Lou fans we surprisingly found something that rivals and beats. The food is made from quality fresh ingredients.

We ordered a large thin crust pizza with pepperoni, garlic, and green peppers. This is our specialty combination of toppings. It was plenty for the two of us with another set of servings to take home and eat as leftovers. We are not typically thin crust people - We prefer &#34;double dough&#34; - but we enjoyed this pizza. The garlic nicely permeated every bite, as if it were incorporated into the sauce. 

The craft beer selection was mostly bottled, though we found A Lil Sumpin Sumpin on tap and enjoyed that. We were there on a Saturday at around noon and had the bar to ourselves. There is another wing to the restaurant with dining tables and booths but a birthday party was being set up there so we opted for the bar. There is not much in the way of upholstery or fabric to absorb sound so sound tends to bounce around a lot. That&#39;s something to think about during busier hours, if your voice can&#39;t compete with bar noise, like mine. 

Almost forgot about dessert. We shared an ice cream dish with a warm, giant cookie on the bottom and three cherries on top. It was a lot so be sure to share if you get that! It&#39;s too tasty to wasty.

Really one of the best deep dish pizza around (in my opinion)! Way better than Giordano&#39;s, Lou Malnati&#39;s, and Gino&#39;s East. 

Peqouds is known for their &#34;crusty pizza&#34; with the caramelized crust. I love peqouds. However, when I&#39;m in the mood for something soft and more cheesy, this is my go-to place. It is slightly more expensive compared to peqouds but it&#39;s worth the cost! The ambiance is very &#34;adult like&#34; with better looking dining area then most places. There is a huge window that peeks into kitchen if you want to physically see the ETA of your pizza. The parking lot and other stores around give you the &#34;the glen&#34; feel in Glenview. 

The mozzarella sticks here are WAYYYYYY better than at Peqouds or any other deep dish place. It&#39;s $8.25 for 7 mozzarella sticks. 

Our waitress was nothing too special, in fact I&#39;d say she was slightly below average. She was slow to refill our waters/drinks. Also my sister&#39;s drink was flat. However, the food made up for it.",05/01/16,129,5,2,5,19,4.0855,2.413,0.139,13.448000000000002,No,1145

We ordered the dough nuggets for an appetizer.   They were good, but the marinara dipping sauce stole the show.

I like a lite more gooeyness to the cheese.

She did, and after a sip or two, we found she was right. Tonight was a time for the tried and true brand - purely survival.

Anywho, this place has a nice set up with plenty of seating!  Their staff is amazing and extremely attentive and courteous!  They have a great and extensive (but not overwhelming) drink menu with good pricing (beer ranging $4-7 and mixed/martinis in the $8 range). ..not to shabby eh!?!

Their pizza is delicious!  The hubby and I ordered a thin crust 14inch pizza half cheese half pepperoni and it was so good!  We had about 5 squares each to take home.  We have also been obsessed with that cookie and ice cream dessert at restaurants so we ordered that too...yum...enough said.

Our bill was $47 for 3 beers, 14 inch pizza and dessert.  They have a rewards club that is free to join.  Once you get 300 points you get $20 added to your card! Its free...so why not join!?!?

I was thinking about going to somewhere quick and cheap, and instead fired up Yelp, which pointed me here. Always a fan of Deep Dish and Stuffed Pizza, I was intrigued.

So glad I dined here! I was by myself so I sat at a high top in the bar area and watched some football while waiting for the food. First impressions; very clean and attentive staff (hostess and bartender especially).

But the real reason to come is for the pizza and Holy Cow was it delicious!

She&#39;s been one of my servers before, but she always delivers an incredible experience. This time, my friend had a BAD work day. The critical start of the meal was going to be that first beer. He struggled between ordering one he knew and a new one he wanted to try. She seemed hesitant about the &#34;test&#34; one, so she asked if she could bring a sample. She did, and after a sip or two, we found she was right. Tonight was a time for the tried and true brand - purely survival.

Dinner was simple though. We ordered the artichoke dip and thin crust sausage pizza. The dip was the perfect balance to snack upon while discussing the day&#39;s events, and the pizza was 90% great. The flavor - perfect. The past few times I&#39;ve had the thin crust there, the edges were burned some. I worked around it, but I still think the restaurant is wonderful and not as busy/chaotic as Cooper&#39;s Hawk (which I also enjoy) nearby.

I was so caught off guard by his awesome question I looked at my hubby like, omg! What do we say??!??! lol.  Im sorry but to me I just think that is just so cool to ask...maybe its a standard thing in restaurants, but as much as we have gone out to eat with our baby, no one has ever asked that.

Anywho, this place has a nice set up with plenty of seating!  Their staff is amazing and extremely attentive and courteous!  They have a great and extensive (but not overwhelming) drink menu with good pricing (beer ranging $4-7 and mixed/martinis in the $8 range). ..not to shabby eh!?!

Their pizza is delicious!  The hubby and I ordered a thin crust 14inch pizza half cheese half pepperoni and it was so good!  We had about 5 squares each to take home.  We have also been obsessed with that cookie and ice cream dessert at restaurants so we ordered that too...yum...enough said.

Our bill was $47 for 3 beers, 14 inch pizza and dessert.  They have a rewards club that is free to join.  Once you get 300 points you get $20 added to your card! Its free...so why not join!?!?

We booked a private room at Georgio&#39;s for our rehearsal dinner last month, and there really aren&#39;t enough good things I can say about the staff here (Oh yeah, and the food is really good too!).  Even though things were a little fuzzy for me at nights end, I can&#39;t think of one thing that wasn&#39;t perfect. 

We had a party of about 50 people for the event, and we got a pizza package with a customized drink menu of various wines and beers.  Dominique was our coordinator for the event and she was awesome to deal with.  She was readily available by email for the months leading up to the event, and was very accomodating with any requests we had, such as special entrees for vegans (I&#39;m not one don&#39;t judge me!!!), and setting up a projector for slideshows and videos.  She even sent us thank you cards after the event, which was really cool.

On the day of the event she was around to coordinate the buffet style setup and prepped the rest of the staff on our package details.  I have to give a shout out to the service staff that night, they kept the drinks coming fast, and we were a big drinking group. Even towards the end when we were all hammered and trying to get up to our minimum with shots, they were patient and quick with the tray. 

As far as the food goes, unless you are a complete pizza snob who can&#39;t find it in your &#34;born on the south side, raised on da bears, chi-town or die!&#34; heart to give props to a suburb deep dish joint, you will absolutely enjoy it.  Everyone in our party loved the pizza, and we even had a frozen one we took to go and reheated it last week and it was still awesome.  I haven&#39;t tried anything else there, but I&#39;d imagine you would be satisfied with whatever you order.

I usually call half an hour before getting there and then only have to wait five minutes at most.

Love the large comfy booths here.  Plenty of flat screens for game watching. Watched Joaquin Noah break his ankle against the 76ers last night.  Over and over and over again.  Ouch.

Thin crust 10&#34; small ($13.49) for specialty pizzas. Crust was amazing. Wafer thin.  Oh so crunchy. We ordered the Papa Georgio crispy peperoni and bacon, sausage, onion and were not disappointed. Also tried their dough nuggets ($6.99) fried pizza dough in a Parmesan garlic butter sauce serves with a side of their homemade marinara sauce.  Too garlicky. Pepsi products-boo.

On our second visit, we tried their deep dish pizza.  Took about 30 minutes to cook.  Not bad.  Small specialty spinach &amp; cheese deep dish ($17.49) 6 slices. Strong garlic flavor.  A little too cheesy for me.  Crust could have used more flavor, a little dry.  Took half of it home.  Think we&#39;ll stick with thin crust from now on.

A HUGE plus....you can order a bloody Mary here for dinner.  It comes served in a pint glass with salt &amp; pepper rim (my favorite). Hearty garnish of black olive slices, giardinero pepper, Swiss cheese, pepperoni, salami, and celery. Asked for olives &amp; they added two big green olives. All for $5.

Service was friendly but not always attentive on our first visit.  Our glasses sat empty a while until we could track down our server and we waited about 10 minutes for our credit card to be run.

Growing up in the small town of McHenry, for dinner we would go to Crystal Lake since there was more options and in that town was the amazing Georgios.  It was actually one of our first dates and we had always missed it since moving to the Burg.  So one day we are in South Barrington and see the Georgios sign... now can that be, the same awesome Chicago style pizza from Crystal Lake?!  We got home, pulled up the website and yes, oh yes, it was the same place and now its only minutes away.  I have no idea how we never noticed it before... but now its all we can think about.

Came here for an impromptu double date and started off with the dough nuggets--hello deliciousness!!  Totally flaky and fluffy all at the same time and the potion is HUGE.  All four of us just totally devoured it and patiently waited for our deep dish pizza, thank goodness they take a while cause we were getting full.

Once the pizza comes out its pipping hot and they serve you the first slice.  The crust is so buttery and I was all-too-happy to dip it in ranch or hot sauce.  I did wish, however, that their price for toppings wasn&#39;t so expensive.

Anywho, our waitress was a complete doll, always helping us out with food and/or drink suggestions.  Never pushy and came by the right amount of times to see how we were doing.

You know how even crappy pizza is good pizza when you&#39;re hungry? (Think about that; it&#39;s true!)

Well, this pizza is fresh but kind of blah... expensive but not worth it.

The ambiance is like that of a hotel lobby and yet they call it &#39;Georgio&#39;s&#39; as if it&#39;s a boutique eatery with a unique Italian feel. It&#39;s not any of those.

The &#39;dough nugget&#39; appetizer sucked too. It&#39;s just pizza dough chopped into squares and deep-fried. The word &#39;nugget&#39; implies a chewy, doughy piece with crispy exterior; instead, it&#39;s $8.00 of air-filled dough skins.

I was just disappointed with this place. You know, you can spend $8 at Panera and get consistently delicious food. Heck, I can order the $10 Pizza Hut pizza in hand-tossed style and it&#39;s really awesome, ESPECIALLY for Pizza Hut.

georgios-chicago-pizzeria-and-pub-south-barrington,Catherine P.,#NAME?,Q30Z0k9p34LsnNFn1_8DPA,"Was at the Arboretum to do some shopping, realized it was getting late and we needed to eat. This place caught the corner of my driving through here the week before and I wanted to try it out. Figured it couldn&#39;t be that bad seeing as the parking lot surrounding the place was packed and it looked pretty busy through their windows.

Walked in, not too sure of the dress code, and was pleasantly surprised to see my flip flops were not frowned upon here. 

Our lovely, and very attentive server, twisted my arm and talked us into the truffle fries app. It was VERY garlic-y. I love garlic, more than most, but it was garlic to the extreme. The amount of fries they serve you is a smingen too much for only 2 people and they don&#39;t really reheat, so it&#39;s best to try these bad boys when you are a party of 3 or 4.

I typically am not one to go out for pizza, but the deep dish looked really good and our server told us it was very popular. We ordered a sausage deep dish. It took quite a while to cook, as most deep dish pizzas do, so don&#39;t be in a hurry if you want to try this pie. Its cheesy and they do a layer of sausage on their deep dish. 

Between the two of us, we just about half of our pizza and the left overs reheated beautifully in the oven for dinner the next night. 

Their thin crust looked very good, as well and that will be on my list to try soon.

There are plenty of TV&#39;s to watch, its a very cleanly facility, and the service was superb. The manager knew when was a good time to stop by and check on the table and made it point to circulate throughout the entire room over the duration of our meal. 

They also have a very nice bar which is separated from the loud restaurant which I thought was a great idea on their part.

CPK, Lou Malnati&#39;s and other high-end eateries charge about $8-15 for their pizza servings, so I&#39;m not sure why I volunteered nearly $20 for a deep-dish of just cheese, pepperoni and too much salty-sauce with a mediocre crust.

You know how even crappy pizza is good pizza when you&#39;re hungry? (Think about that; it&#39;s true!)

Well, this pizza is fresh but kind of blah... expensive but not worth it.

The ambiance is like that of a hotel lobby and yet they call it &#39;Georgio&#39;s&#39; as if it&#39;s a boutique eatery with a unique Italian feel. It&#39;s not any of those.

The &#39;dough nugget&#39; appetizer sucked too. It&#39;s just pizza dough chopped into squares and deep-fried. The word &#39;nugget&#39; implies a chewy, doughy piece with crispy exterior; instead, it&#39;s $8.00 of air-filled dough skins.

I was just disappointed with this place. You know, you can spend $8 at Panera and get consistently delicious food. Heck, I can order the $10 Pizza Hut pizza in hand-tossed style and it&#39;s really awesome, ESPECIALLY for Pizza Hut.

Had the dough nuts which were okay.  The sauce had a good flavor.  Also ordered a Cesar salad. I came out so over dressed it was not edible. It was literally like 3 dollops of mayo on a cup of lettuce. When I asked to have it less dressed, a new salad came back with no dressing. Umm...

We also had a couple of thin crust pizzas and a couple deep dish pizzas. I would compare the thin crust pizzas to a frozen pizza. It is even served with the cardboard round so you feel right at home. The deep dish pizza was decent. It seemed fresh and had good flavor.  I know there are better options for pizza in the burbs. Gas prices are low.

This place caught the corner of my driving through here the week before and I wanted to try it out. Figured it couldn&#39;t be that bad seeing as the parking lot surrounding the place was packed and it looked pretty busy through their windows.

Walked in, not too sure of the dress code, and was pleasantly surprised to see my flip flops were not frowned upon here. 

Our lovely, and very attentive server, twisted my arm and talked us into the truffle fries app. It was VERY garlic-y. I love garlic, more than most, but it was garlic to the extreme. The amount of fries they serve you is a smingen too much for only 2 people and they don&#39;t really reheat, so it&#39;s best to try these bad boys when you are a party of 3 or 4.

I typically am not one to go out for pizza, but the deep dish looked really good and our server told us it was very popular. We ordered a sausage deep dish. It took quite a while to cook, as most deep dish pizzas do, so don&#39;t be in a hurry if you want to try this pie. Its cheesy and they do a layer of sausage on their deep dish. 

Between the two of us, we just about half of our pizza and the left overs reheated beautifully in the oven for dinner the next night. 

Their thin crust looked very good, as well and that will be on my list to try soon.

It was a chance encounter that I had dinner with friends and we went to Georgio&#39;s. I&#39;ve been going back ever since. It&#39;s totally worth the drive from Naperville.  

Let me say I LOVE the Second City thin crust pizza. It&#39;s like a barnyard on a plate. Ground sausage, bacon, pepperoni and ham... how can you go wrong? I love the deep dish pizza too. It just oozes the cheese and sauce and usually one slice is enough (they&#39;re huge!). Everything taste so fresh and it&#39;s great to watch your pie being made in the kitchen. 

Another plus: the appetizers. The wings are meaty and the cheese fries are packed with yummy cheesy bacony goodness. You can&#39;t go wrong with any of the selections. 

Alcohol? Yes sir, they make a really good Hurricane which is kinda rare out in this part of the country. When I want a fruit flavored drink, I head here. 

The one downside is they don&#39;t really take reservations. That&#39;s never been a problem because we usually walk in and can get a table in under 15 minutes.

Great atmosphere. Plenty of parking. Good service. Comfortable seating. Delicious food. These are the reasons that I will be back very soon. 

We tried the cheese fries with bacon on our most recent visit. I am not a big cheese fan, but wanted to get something that my family would enjoy. Enjoy?  Yep...all three of us did. They were really good. The deep dish crust is very bakery bread-esque. It&#39;s good. I think I like it more than my hubby, but he didn&#39;t dislike it and he ate the leftovers without complaint so I think he&#39;s a fan. The thin crust is nice with just the right amount of crispiness and a good amount of toppings. Again, good stuff!

We had two different servers as there was a large party in their private room but they both managed to keep up with everything and not get frazzled.  Since we knew we wanted to try a deep dish (40 min wait) and we had already waited a half hour for a table we were starving.  Dough nuggets &amp; a beer flight to the rescue!  We liked how you can choose the three different brews to sample for the flight as well.  

We had the Papa Georgio deep dish minus the bacon.  Their menu says their large pizza serves 3-4 people...I&#39;d say it would easily serve 6 guys, at least for deep dish.  I could only eat 1 slice and hubby had 2 so we had TONS of leftovers to bring home.  I&#39;ve heard others comment on their sauce being on the salty side.  I would agree it could use a tad less salt but it wasn&#39;t bad.  I was disappointed in the amount of toppings they put on our pizza.  When you are paying $2 per ingredient on a large pizza I&#39;d expect they wouldn&#39;t be as stingy - and I&#39;m not talking just the meat, even the veggies were scarce.  It&#39;s because of this I didn&#39;t give them 4 stars.  Since we&#39;ve only been here this one time I don&#39;t know if this is normal for them or not.  The taste overall was very good.  I still like my Lou&#39;s the best BUT I will say Georgio&#39;s deep dish crust is THE BEST crust I&#39;ve had.

**Minor update, not worth doing a formal update, but I&#39;ll just Edit my review to add:  We went to the Arboretum for the 2013 Burger Bash on Sept. 21st.  5 restaurants from the shopping center participated &amp; after sampling burgers from each you got to vote on your favorite burger.  Our group of 3 all agreed - Georgio&#39;s had the tastiest burger!  They had a flavorful &amp; juicy meat with a hint of sage, and a good buttery pretzel bun.  Ironic, since none of us would have ever thought of going to Georgio&#39;s for a burger.

The pizza was warm, smelled so great as I drove it back to the office, had the potential to be delicious, but unfortunately was just okay.

Get ready!! Get Set!  GO! :) 

-----

Georgio&#39;s Chicago Pizzeria &amp; Pub is a local family-owned pizzeria, which has their flagship in Crystal Lake.  It was so popular that they opened a NEW Georgio&#39;s Chicago Pizzeria &amp; Pub in South Barrington in the Arboretum.

I had seen this place open up not too long ago, and I have been meaning to try it.  I LOVE pizza, but since I&#39;ve went on a special diet since April(part of the reason of the lack of reviews since I mostly review restaurants) I had to wait until the right time to try it.

We first went to Georgio&#39;s in the mid-afternoon with the kids.  There were a few patrons in the dining area and a few in the bar.  We started off with two thin crust pizzas: a Papa Georgio (sausage, bacon, pepperoni, mushroom, onion, green pepper) and a plain cheese pizza for the kids.  We also ordered an appetizer of their Parmesan Truffle Fries.

I&#39;ll have to tell you those truffle fries are so awesome!  Crispy, truffly with just a hint of shaved parmesan on them.  Not a lot, just enough!  Talk about your carbgasm! YUM YUMMMM!   

As for the thin crust pizza....well....

O M G!  Lemme tell you...maybe it was because I hadn&#39;t had pizza in weeks/months?, BUT that was one of the crispiest, freshest pizzas I had had in a LOOOOOOONG TIME! 

Seriously! It was darn tasty! The crust was perfectly done, crispy like a cracker almost and the ingredients were FRESH, especially the veggies.   OH, and they do NOT skimp on the toppings. The sauce was not overdone at all!  Just enough to give you that light taste of tomato sauce.  

You are getting a LOT of toppings for a pretty darned good price! $14 for a 10&#34;(enough for 2 people) or $21 for a 14&#34;(enough for 4)  

The kids RAVED about the pizzas saying, &#34;It is the BEST pizza ever!&#34;  and I&#39;d have to agree....IT IS! YUMYUM!    

We&#39;ve been to Georgio&#39;s at least one more time after our initial visit and have not been let down!  

The interior is very modern and chic!  Not just some &#34;usual family pizzeria&#34;  Dark woods, leather-bound booths, and they have a good number of flatscreens.  They had them around the main dining area as well as a small semi-private room, which could be used for a private function.

It wasn&#39;t too loud in there, very family-friendly and had a good comfortable hip vibe to it.  The service was top notch, food came out quickly enough and the food quality was spot on!

We have not tried any of their desserts or their version of Chicago Deep Dish, but I think that is next on our agenda! :)

Oh, also, they have a Rewards Club, which is totally free.  For every $1 you spend at Georgio&#39;s you get 1 point.  Collect 300 points and you get a $20 gift card added to the Rewards Card.  The higher the points you get, the more rewards you get!  And you can use it not only on dining-in, but take-out as well!

If you are in the South Barrington area and are craving some REALLY good pizza....Georgio&#39;s is IT! :) GO, GO NOW....GO! :)",09/10/11,398,5,1,5,-11,12.3213,7.238,1.075,37.68599999999999,No,3258

georgios-chicago-pizzeria-and-pub-south-barrington,Kim M.,VaDDhoa-IGKj3BMCHUxc4Q,1CUGKEyv7lcYvl020u9bRw,"After a long day at a cheer competition, my daughter decided on pizza for an early dinner. We were in the area so we stopped at Georgio&#39;s. 

The atmosphere of this place is great. When you walk in, to the right is the bar -- with great seating and great views of the game. To the left is the general seating area. The booths are large and comfortable, and no matter where you sit you can see the game on tv.

We went on a Wednesday night and although it wasn&#39;t packed, most tables were occupied most of the time.  Our server Dominique, explained some of the menu items and made a few suggestions.  

We started out with the parmesan truffle fries.  Both of us liked that.  A little garlic, a little parmesan, a lot of oil.  Keep the napkin handy!  But it is good!

After some deliberation, we decided on a small deep dish pizza.  It took 30-40 minutes to get it.  It is noted on the menu that it takes 40 minutes for the deep dish pizzas so it was no surprise.  The pizza was very good.  My wife likes it better than pretty much any other place in the area.  I still prefer Lou&#39;s, but it was right up there.

Dominique was good about refills on our drinks and making sure we didn&#39;t need anything else.  The only slight issue was that once we were ready to go, we couldn&#39;t find her for a little while.  Not a huge problem for us though as it wasn&#39;t all that long.

We got there around prime dinner time but found the place a little bare. I usually get a little apprehensive because a place that is worth going to is usually busy. But I let that go because the inside of the place enticed me! It was modern but welcoming and it had t.v.s showing basketball. Gotta love it. The restaurant itself was divided into the bar area and dining area and even had a private party section! Good venue for sure. 

They have a good selection of beer and wine, cocktails and specialty drinks. Not an overwhelming amount, which I appreciate because it would have taken me ages to find a drink. I ordered the (insert name of it here because dangit I forgot) and I added the Meyer&#39;s float for $1. It was OK, but not my taste. 

We ordered truffle fries to snack on while we waited about 35 minutes for the deep dish sausage pizza. The fries were delicious but they grazed the tops of them with shaved Parmesan that looked and felt more like wax paper. The pizza though, DAMN was that good. The crust wasn&#39;t so buttery compared to Giordanos or a Lous, so you left feeling pretty good you just ate a deep dish pizza. We ordered the small one, but were able to bring 2 slices back home. 

The service was a little slow, but understandable since I believe our waiter had several tables to take care of.

It is refreshing to see an owner and staff who actually care about the opinions and comments of their patrons.

This time around we decided to change things up as much as possible. We sat in the bar area and ordered a pitcher so that we could pour our own drinks as we pleased. We started out with the spicy buffalo wings and received a well presented healthy portion. I&#39;d have to say they were decent but nothing to write home about. I was just happy to have something that tasted like it should with my beer while we waited for the pizza. 

Brian suggested that I try a pizza that did not contain salty meats such as bacon and pepperoni so we ordered the Mama Primavera which is basically a veggie pizza. I would have like to at least have had sausage with the veggies but there are no substitutions for the specialty pizza menu. No problem, we like veggies anyway. The crust came out as expected, nice and crispy with just a little chew underneath the sauce. The pizza in general was definitely less salty this time because of the lack of meat but the saltiness in the sauce was unmistakable after the first few bites. There was a fantastic garlic kick that we enjoyed but in the end we still agreed that a little less salt would allow the other flavors to shine through more. We were hungry and they pizza was much better than last time so we managed to finish the whole thing.

I understand that everyone&#39;s palate differs (as the manager, Tim, pointed out to me) but I stand by my opinion that the sauce is too salty. That said I really respect the fact that the owner actually cares what people think and took the initiative to contact me.

Thin-crust pizzas are excellent when ordered well-done (probably excellent any way).  The sausage-pepperoni had great flavor.  The sausage-bacon-garlic was surprisingly a little boring, as this is a standard combo I&#39;ve come to have to try just about anywhere.  The bacon was precooked, which means the best part of the bacon, the fat, had been cooked out, and not allowed to saturate the pizza.

pauls-family-restaurant-elgin,Cyn P.,SV8w2Lo0AdXM97BYoCFKNQ,wXIXjanJENJOmOZBIQk7fw,"Stopped in due to reviews on Yelp. Based on one experience this is my impression as a solo diner:

Parking - easy breezy.

Building  - cute and maybe a little dated but absolutely in good repair and larger than it looks from the outside 

Cleanliness -  This place is pretty spotless where it counts including the bathroom.  I often look at the ceilings in restaurants and check out the heating/cooling vents/ducts.  They seemed spotless.   

Menu - pretty big with daily specials 

Prices - mid range - neither too low or high

Service - not over solicitous / adequate - filled coffee twice without prompting

Food:  I decided on a chopped steak with soup and salad and coffee.  The homemade bean soup was very nice. The homemade ranch salad dressing was really good and with just a hint of horseradish.  The salad was fresh.  Nice small basket with bread and butter.  The chopped steak was cooked as ordered, and was topped with (dare I say canned) mushrooms and a cheese that I decided to remove.  Mashed potatoes were nice - could not discern if they were real potatoes made with water or instant made with milk - or maybe a combination (my mom used to combine real and instant). The gravy was good too - not too salty.  

Overall impression: It&#39;s a nice family run family oriented business - fair prices / good food. 

Next time I hope to try to meatloaf.",12/04/16,161,3,1,5,5,5.614300000000001,3.2070000000000003,0.284,11.509,No,1364

There is a feeling of kindness and welcoming that was completely missing before.  They have done a bit of updating that is quite lovely as well.

A couple of weeks ago when I was in there, a lovely lady came by and asked if all was well.  Her name is Betty and she was just lovely, kind and inviting.  I told her how much of a difference it makes being greeted with a smile instead of a scowl.

If you order something on the menu and it says it comes with &#34;cheese&#34; - it will be American cheese.  I&#39;m the type that unless I&#39;m making a grilled cheese or entertaining a child there is no American cheese in my house.  So the first time we came here I was dissappointed my Paul&#39;s Skillet -which has all my other favorite ingredients in a skillet - had American cheese.  Oh well, my fault for not asking.

We recently came here a second time and noted that other items on the menu do claim to come with &#34;cheddar cheese&#34; so I&#39;m sure you could ask for a substition.  This time I orded the Corned Beef Hash Skillet from the specials menu - no cheese listed as an ingredient, nor would I want any.  When it came and I started to dig in, lo and behold, American cheese lurked within!  Yuck!  Totally ruined that skillet experience.

Sriracha wings: loved the soy, ginger, garlic, sriracha flavors combined.  There is a hint of a crunch to the batter when you bite in, just wish it had been slightly more crispy. But, the seasoning is great.

Overall: decent BBQ place with a cool atmosphere but I feel like my ribs were average and in particular wish they were more tender and smoky.  But, willing to give it another go if I&#39;m in the area to sample the other items on the menu.",30/01/16,125,3,2,5,28,4.9535,2.52,0.159,8.32,No,1130

Nice interior, it is very clean and enjoyed the music/videos they had. When we left they had a guitarist setting up for live music. They also have a few tables outside on the sidewalk.

As for the food the quality of the meat is very good. The meat is not fatty or greasy, much better than most bbqs in the area. The chicken and brisket were very tender and moist. I think they could use a bit more flavoring/smokiness to the meat. I would pass on the ribs. They were a little tough for my taste. The sides are good. We enjoyed the cornbread, corn fritters and mac and cheese.  We also tried the cheesy potatoes but feel they needed to be cooked a bit more.  It is pricey but I&#39;m comfortable with the price point with noticeable better meat than most other places. Sauces are good but adding a few more might be a good suggestion as everyone has different preferences.

As we walked in, I liked how clean the place looked.  That&#39;s a very good first impression in my world.
At first, I was thinking they&#39;re not ready for the lunch crowd yet.  I can&#39;t smell any smoke or food smell.  I was wrong.

I ordered the 1/2lb barbecue burger with fried egg +, for a $1 more, fries.  No fountain drink.  Just water.
I paid $11.29 for my meal.  Not bad at all for what I received.

Delicious sandwich!  Fries were cooked perfectly.  Portion&#39;s good.

I tried their Sweet &amp; Tangy BBQ sauce and their Spicy BBQ sauce.  Like &#39;em both.
I dipped my fries in the sauces and ketchup.

I remember telling my co-worker I like the burger I&#39;m having vs Five Guys.

Around Lake Zurich, for burgers, I always tell people who ask me, I go to Gilmer Road House in Mundelein for the &#34;Stoplight Special&#34;.  Gilmer doesn&#39;t call it that name anymore.
It&#39;s a 1/2lb burger with Swiss cheese and bacon (thick cut).  Lettuce, tomato, onion on the side + fries.

I ordered the sandwich which comes with a side for $1 extra (lunch special). The sandwich came with onions and a small amount of sauce, but was a bit on the dry side.

Quick review:
1. Overly Expensive
2. Bad food that shouldn&#39;t be called BBQ.
3. Not all of the food bought was given.
4. Terrible BBQ Sauce

1. So this one might be a little more subjective, but my wife and I ordered 2 Two Meat combos, and two soft drinks. That&#39;s all. No add&#39;l sides, extra food, beer, wine, etc. And it was $50. Yes $50 for just two people, no alcohol. 

2. I don&#39;t know where to stay but the pulled pork and chicken, I can guarantee they were cooked in a crockpot. They were watery, soggy, not smoked, and no crispiness at all. Very disappointing. The brisket was cooked in an oven. Again no crispiness at all. No smoked flavor. And the ribs. The only decent part of the meal, was definitely oven baked and finished on the grill, but again, only meh. To me, for food go be called BBQ, it has to be smoked  or grilled, or both. And then the sides. Slaw was actually pretty good, but the cheesy potatoes tasted like a box mix of potatoes with some shredded cheese.  And the corn bread was cold, hard as a rock and flavorless.

3. And that was for the food given. Included with our order were two sides. When the food came out, they only brought us out 2 of our four sides! For a $50 meal, completely unacceptable.

4. Finally, the BBQ sauce. They had only two to choose from, regular and spicy. I&#39;m first of all fully convinced, both were filled with the same BBQ. Second I&#39;m fully convinced that they just bought their BBQ from McDonald&#39;s.

What can I say, for $50, and quality this is a place I&#39;ll never go again. No value, no quality. There&#39;s so many better places. Heck I&#39;m regretting we didn&#39;t go to Five Guys.",19/02/16,230,1,1,2,-12,1.5976000000000004,3.68,3.8609999999999998,27.459,No,1872

Not too complicated but with enough variety to keep it interesting. Music was great and the decor was very in keeping with the theme of the name of the restaurant. The owners were very friendly and made us feel welcome and didn&#39;t rush us at any point.

Onto the food: we got several things from the menu. Several things that make us want to go back. The Sriracha Sticky Wings were amazing. Crispy, slightly sticky, and a nice balance of sweet and spicy. They were too overly sauced and I was disappointed I had to share. My favorite thing off the menu so far. The Fixx is a mountain of fries, topped with pulled pork, pico de gallo, and a fried egg. Yes, a fried egg. These were amazing, but I feared the calorie count if I&#39;d had more than a few bites. Definitely an app to share.

Entrees: pulled pork over Mac and cheese was great. Also tried the brisket over Mac and cheese which was not as good. The brisket released some juices which basically watered down the pasta underneath. Pass on the brisket. I got the brisket dinner. I&#39;ve had better, but I&#39;ll state that I&#39;m from Texas and used to a very tender and fatty brisket. This was a bit dry for my taste. My husband for the competition ribs. These were some great ribs. Lean, meaty, and with the sauce, very good. If you want ribs, definitely a good choice.

Sides: Mac and cheese is mediocre. A bit bland, but sufficiently cheesy. Could have used a bit more salt. The coleslaw suffered the same mediocrity. Also needed some salt. The beans were really quite good and well-seasoned although a bit on the sweet side. If you like baked beans, worth a try. Cheesy potatoes. Next time we&#39;ll be getting a large order of this. Amazingly delicious. Great flavor, great texture, the way cheesy potatoes should be.

Next time I go back, I&#39;m ordering wings for myself and maybe a side of cheesy potatoes for myself as well. I&#39;ll probably try the adult fries because I love garlic (these are fries drizzled with garlic butter and crumbled blue cheese). I&#39;ll avoid the brisket and hope that someone gets ribs so I can have a couple. Rock &#39;n Ribs does some things right: pork and potatoes mainly. Could use some work on their beef and some of their sides.",12/06/15,316,4,2,5,13,11.2994,8.979999999999997,1.44,33.580999999999996,No,2573

rock-n-ribs-bbq-lake-zurich,Mike D.,xo21Wghh4RSda9yGFSjteA,ssh8tbnnZpGRXitf7n4-hw,"BBQ aficionado (not quite connoisseur)  here to review Rock &#39;n Ribs in LZ.  

 I travel to Austin TX for work several times a year and frequent the likes of the Salt Lick, Rudy&#39;s, Stiles Switch and several others.  The only two places in the CHI-area I have frequented that can compare to Austin BBQ is Real Urban BBQ, and Smoque.  These two places smoke their meat for 13+ hours, and it shows.  Smoke ring?  Check.  Smoky flavor?  Check.  Juicy and pull-apart tender?  Check.  Yes, the bar is high.

Upon pulling into the parking lot of the strip mall BBQ joint &#34;Rock n&#39; Ribs&#34; immediately, something was missing...I didn&#39;t smell smoke.  Around most BBQ places you can smell the smoke for several hundred yards depending on the wind, but here, nothing.  The finicky powers that be on the LZ board must have forced the owners to put in some fancy smoke containment system.  Walking past a patio where a few professional were taking their lunch break, I entered the building to find a clean and warm atmosphere.  The rock theme is well done, not in your face, nice colors, newly remodeled, very clean and warm.  I personally prefer the whole picnic table and wax paper thing this place was more than fine.  There was something missing though...still no smoke.

Approaching the counter I met Terry, who I think is the owner.  First question was &#34;So, how long do you smoke your brisket?&#34;...at which point Terry told me the following, and I paraphrase &#34;We don&#39;t smoke anything here, we use a proprietary technique for our BBQ.  But, trust me, our brisket and all of our meats are just as good as smoked meats.

&#34;BLASPHEMY&#34;!!!  I learned a long time ago, if it ain&#39;t smoked, you can&#39;t call it BBQ.  Roasted, baked, grilled, braised, fried, but not BBQ (even wikipedia says BBQ is low and slow over high smoke fule).  Resisting the urge to walk out and drive 20 minutes to Real Urban in Vernon Hills, I thought I would entertain this heresy and asked for a sample of the brisket.

Hmmm....not bad...not bad at all.  I ended up ordering the 3-2-1, 3 slides of pork, brisket and chicken, 2 ribs and 1 side of mac and chese...here is how I rate them:

Brisket - 3 stars.  They were tender, juicy, good texture, passed the pull test, but without a caramelized bark, and smoke taste I can&#39;t go higher than 3 because you put BBQ on the door and that&#39;s what I was expecting.  Much better than the brisket at Mariano&#39;s, (even though that IS smoked) but not on the level of the others I mentioned earlier.

Ribs - 4 stars. - Really juicy, lean and fall of the bone tender, probably their best meat.  Still missing the smoke, but something was refreshing about the purity of the meat shining through.

Pork and Chicken 3 stars - a bit dry and again, missing the smoke flavor.

Mac and cheese 4 stars - actually very good, with a blend of cheeses and big sea shell macaroni that you easily stab and scoop.

Corn bread - 4 stars - really good, with bits of corn.  Seemed home-made, if not they fooled me.

Sauces - 4 stars.  The spicy is nice and spicy, just how I like it.  The sweet was really good too.

Ultimately for a BBQ fanatic like myself, this place would be rated much lower because technically it is not BBQ.  Then again, not everyone loves the smoke flavor, and if you don&#39;t this place is very well done from the food to the service to the atmosphere.  If I were catering a party, I may consider calling these guys because they seem reliable and for the general population, the meat is really, really good.  4 stars for above average food, friendly staff and clean/pleasing atmosphere.",17/04/15,470,4,1,5,-4,6.289500000000001,4.664999999999999,1.776,37.559,No,3651

I came here because I was looking for some great tasting ribs... What I got was ribs that I could cook at home myself. Not that they were bad but they were not the traditionally smoked ribs I was looking for. These seemed to be boiled ribs then cooked over a stove which I enjoy at home from time to time. Ribs seemed to lack sauce and the extra sauce container I received was the size of the tiny ketchup cups you get at McDonald&#39;s, that was a little disappointing.

I also ordered some chicken for which I had to ask if it was in the bag because of the small serving size. I believe it was $11 bucks for a fist size amount of chicken, tasty but not worth the price for me.

The management is extremely friendly here. Alice has treated my friend Adam and I like good friends since we have been going here (every couple weeks or so) since they opened. 

The &#34;cash machines&#34; they use here are iPads (or some sort of tablet) with a restaurant/cash register software and it&#39;s pretty damn cool. Always appreciate businesses taking advantage of new technology. 

The atmosphere is enjoyable -- the TV screens adorning each corner of the restaurant play both classic and obscure music videos and live performance footage (all genres) -- it&#39;s a great touch and keeps you entertained while waiting for the food to arrive. 

I usually come in and get the Korean BBQ Tacos (which I think are only served on Tuesdays?) and they are phenomenal. Not a huge portion, but the cashier will tell you that to begin with, they don&#39;t hide the fact. You get a side with it and I always get the Mac N&#39; Cheese. It&#39;s creamy and delicious -- they use big shells as opposed to actual macaroni noodles. I appreciate them, as they hold in more of the cheese sauce (which saves me the embarrassment of cleaning the bowl with my finger... ha). 

I&#39;ve yet to try the ribs which is kind of stupid on my part seeing as it is a BBQ restaurant with award winning ribs -- I will soon. I&#39;ve also had the Pulled Pork Mac N&#39; Cheese and it&#39;s very good, but again, it&#39;s not a hefty enough portion -- requires an extra side or something to make it feel like a full meal.

The place was clean, albeit gimmicky inside.  A few TV&#39;s playing music videos, a few others playing the basketball game.  A few prints of bands on the wall, but nothing else really rock&#39;n&#39; about the ambiance.

Despite being pretty empty, the food took forever to come out.  I understand, it&#39;s prep&#39;ed to order, but so is the food at many other places much faster than this place.

The food itself was so-so.  The pulled chicken was good, but the portion was WAY too small for the price.  The mac and cheese was borderline flavorless; maybe they forgot the salt.  The cheesy potatoes were kind of bizarre...  The flavor reminded me of that of the scalloped potatoes from the old &#34;Carson&#39;s Ribs&#34;, but the potatoes themselves were shredded like hash-browns, and they were woefully under-cooked.  The result was an odd experience in your mouth, where the good taste and the bizarre firm, &#34;piecey&#34; texture just didn&#39;t mesh.  I finished them, but only because the amount of chicken that was provided was so skimpy.

The cornbread was average, and I expected better from a BBQ place.  Compare to the cornbread at Beelow&#39;s, for example, and it&#39;s a no-contest.  I would think the cornbread at a BBQ place would beat the cornbread at a steak joint, but no such luck.

The chopped chicken salad was boring.  I know, I know -- who gets a salad at a BBQ joint?  Well, I do, and it&#39;s a good litmus test of working outside your &#34;niche&#34;.  Not only was the salad lacking in diversity ingredient-wise, but the chicken had nothing &#34;BBQ&#34; about it -- just a boring, dry chicken breast.  Innovate a little bit, will ya?  How about a grilled BBQ chicken breast, or a portion of the pulled chicken mixed into the salad?  Why in the world would you stop at a plain old chicken breast at a BBQ joint?  At very least make the dressing BBQ-oriented (BBQ ranch, for example). 

The salad was a failure and as it stands should be only ordered by vegetarians dragged to a BBQ place as a cruel joke (pick out the chicken, of course; you won&#39;t be missing anything).

I found this place tucked in behind the American Charter Bank in LZ&#39;s Village Square.  I&#39;ve already been there twice, and will continue now that I know where to get my rib fix.

I&#39;m originally from the south where BBQ, and especially ribs, are a serious affair.  This place nails it.

I&#39;ve had ribs (&#34;Competition&#34; ribs) both times and they were fantastic.  Very tender, and a great homemade BBQ sauce that enhances (not smothers) the meat itself.  They have several sandwiches and even salads that looked good on other customer plates - I&#39;ll try those when I tire of the ribs; which will be a while.

The sides were far better than I&#39;m used to at a BBQ place.  The Creamy Mac &amp; Cheese had to be made from some really good Wisconsin Cheddar, and they have several different type of Fries that make you wonder why you&#39;ve been putting ketchup on fries your entire life.  I&#39;ve had the &#39;Adult Fries&#39; twice - hand cut, freshly made fries with bleu cheese - absolutely wonderful!

Good selection of beers and drinks!  The atmosphere is really cool.  Rock and Roll memorabilia and professional shots of menu items are on the wall, great music playing, and serious concert stage lighting in the middle (hard to describe, but it looks like they may have concerts sometimes).

Be sure to try both of the homemade BBQ sauces as well.  What a great find in a cool environment.  Nothing like listening to Pat Benatar while enjoying a good meal.

We ordered the Champion ribs and brisket. The ribs were prepared well. We did not care for the sauce. The brisket was like from a deli. We did not like the presentation in the paper bowl. It didn&#39;t seem hand cut. Both meats were barely warm. 

For sides we had the Mac N cheese which was watery, luke warm, and did not have a cheesy taste. 
Coleslaw seemed from a deli or a 5 lb tub. Huge chunks of cabbage were unappealing. Baked beans were ok, but were not special. My mom has the same recipe. Corn muffin seemed pre packaged. 

It seems like this isn&#39;t a restaurant but a place to heat up mass produced items. 

I did find it difficult to believe our order was ready less than 5 minutes after we ordered.

The staff at the registers were engaging and had thoughtful opinions, which is a good start!   I liked the ribs with the tender meat and the slight pull needed to get the meat from the bone ( some call this a nice bite and I prefer to falling off the bone).   The pulled pork was juicy and a nice portion.   The sides were a bit inconsistent.  The Mac n cheese was very creamy...but I needed a touch off salt and pepper.  My daughter thought it could have used more chese -- which would have added my salt too.    The cheesy potatoes were cool, but the taste was there.   The fries were good, but I would prefer mine crispier.

  All in all I think this is a nice, unique choice in LZ and one that I will return to.   I suspect it will continue to improve.   I hope it does.

rock-n-ribs-bbq-lake-zurich,Jeff H.,j7HpSIaUe8G0a69A1Ih8sQ,bu_v6RZEgzR2b7SUrYlTMw,"Very clean establishment with friendly, fun staff to work with.  Met Terry, very personable and energetic guy that seems open to feedback and suggestions.  The environment is comfortable, like the circa-1980s vibe complete with rare music videos playing on four screens.  Cheesy potatoes live up to the hype you&#39;ve been reading, and the meat was tender and very good.

All that said, I&#39;ll generously give them four stars.  The simple reason: portions and price.  Fifteen bucks for a pulled pork dinner with two sides isn&#39;t in and of itself a problem to me, so long as the portions are generous.  I have to admit doing a double take when the server brought my plate and I saw the amount of pulled pork portioned out for the meal.  It was essentially a french fry boat filled about half way with good quality meat.  Its just not a maximum value with portions that small at that price.  The best bbq places I&#39;ve had in my day are places that may charge rates like that, but you get plenty of food to go along with it.  

Feedback to Terry and Alice would be to start offering combo plates and ramp up the portions a little if the prices are going to stay at their current rates.

Told Terry on the way out I&#39;d definitely be back to try something else.  I like what I&#39;m reading about the ribs, so maybe that is the encore meal.",06/06/14,152,4,2,5,16,4.844900000000001,2.3899999999999997,0.252,11.357999999999999,No,1347

the food here is excellent, flat out excellent. we have never gone to a restaurant that specializes in smoked food, and left loving theirs more than ours. we have perfected what we do for our tastes.

that being said? the food was fabulous! the ribs were excellent, the smoked pork, chicken and brisket were delicious. and the sriracha chicken wings were also great!!

the service was fine. the owner was at the counter when we got there, and not terribly personable. but we never saw him again. he was in the back, and i was sorry we couldn&#39;t tell him how much we enjoyed the food. 

and one thing i would change? when there&#39;s no one in the restaurant, i would walk the food to the table, instead of calling out a number. we were there on a sunday, around 3:00.  with one other table, i think bringing the food out is a nice touch..

All of the food was excellent though my personal favorite was the pulled pork, which is perfect! I also sampled their cheesy potato and baked beans sides, both were outstanding.

On my second visit I ordered the pulled pork BBQ nachos, again I was amazed at the quality of food that was brought to my table. Truly excellent BBQ. I sampled their signature wings this visit as well, they were cooked to perfection, sweet and a little bit of heat, and crispy.

Everything was delicious. Started with the crab cakes and they tasted so fresh! And meaty. My husband had the oysters and enjoyed those.

Red seafood chowder was so good my mother in law purchased a container to go! Very flavorful and good amounts of seafood- no fillers here!

I ordered the mahi mahi and it was amazing. The mango salsa makes it very light and refreshing. My family members also enjoyed their choices of fish and were glad we found this place.

We will definitely be back for dinner with a bottle of wine!",07/02/16,63,5,2,5,31,4.0075,2.618,0.42900000000000005,7.952999999999999,No,566

Ernesto and his family run a great place. It is as if you are having dinner at his home. He always makes you feel so welcome and his cooking is wonderful. Bring your favorite bottle of wine and be amazed at what he can do with fish and seafood! The limited menu lets him cook up magic, but if fish is not your thing he can always make you a vegetarian dish, but no meat! Oh and he does a great lunch, soup, fish tacos, etc. during the week and Saturdays.
 And if you do want to cook fish at home, you cannot get fresher fish than here. Reservations are a must as he only cooks on Friday and Saturday! We love this place!!",27/07/16,85,5,1,4,3,3.8780000000000006,2.5229999999999997,0.165,8.312,No,698

It&#39;s a small little seafood shop with a restaurant for lunch and dinner.  Reservations are a must on the weekends.  I tried once before to get a reservation for a Saturday, but they were full.  It&#39;s a family run business and the service was a little slow, but that didn&#39;t really bother us.  We were there to have a leisurely dinner. While we were eating the owner/chef came to our table and introduced himself and make sure everything was okay.  He stopped by again during the meal and at the end of our meal to thank us.

I started with crab cake.  It was one of the best I have had outside of the east coast.  I had the seafood chowder which came with the meal and it was also excellent.  It seems to be a soup of the day with whatever seafood is good that day.  For my entree, I tried the gnocchi with shellfish.  Although the shellfish part of the dish was excellent, the pasta fell a little short.  It was a little mushy.  Probably best to stick with what they do best, which is the fish.  My husband got the sea bass and loved it.

They have the best wine and beer in the area, as it is BYOB.  

We will definitely be back and I will get something more traditional off the fish menu. I would love to give 5 stars, but the gnocchi held me back.",06/03/16,139,4,1,5,-3,6.1801,2.736,0.098,17.166,No,1313

This place rocks it!  First, they are a fish market to buy FRESH FISH.  Then, a restaurant.... Small menu, small venue.  The chef, (assuming owner) came to our table.  Not once, twice.  He was gracious and so humble, telling us &#34;it&#39;s nothing really- just olive oil, salt and pepper!&#34;  God love him!!   

This place is small.  Only open three nights 5-8 for dinner, and reservations are pretty much a must.  
They are open for lunch, yet to experience.  The family runs it, no fancy dress, but clean, so very kind.  The chef said the fish is delivered two to three days out of the water.  Worth paying for.  We love fresh fish.  Yes, it&#39;s pricey, but hello, no ocean near here.....,simply prepared by chef in an open kitchen - yes open kitchen.  Flavored awesome, veggies delish!!!

e-and-s-fish-company-st-charles-2,Siobhan C.,uADlRLkppPAej9R0R4KJzg,O-mfGCzr2h5KpcZVYEzuYQ,"This is a nice fish market style, limited eatery, much like some places downtown. Very clean, simple dishes, expertly handled, were the quality of the fish is the star. We showed up 1/2 hr before their scheduled close without a reservation, and we were seated despite being mostly full with some rather large tables. We started with the oysters and tuna tower, which were both tasty, attractively presented and handled well. Than we had the skate fish and grouper. Both were amazing and we enjoyed the healthy simply prepared vegetables, which were seasoned well and delicious. Really impressed by the nice sear on the fish as well. 

A few tips: make a reservation. (This was our first time there, so we didn&#39;t realize it was customary, since most market style eateries don&#39;t really do reservations). This is a small establishment, clearly operated by a family (the kids are the hosts, bus the tables and your wait staff, while the adults prepare the food) so don&#39;t go in there expecting service like a super fine dining restaurant, with a sommelier and extensive experience from your servers, lol. It&#39;s a quaint, market eatery, not Alinea. (That being said, I thought the young staff was very professional, polite and courteous, despite obviously being a little overwhelmed by their 15+ people table, and others). 

Prices are fair for the quality of fish and expert prep (about $30 per entree, which includes their delicious red chowder or salad), blue point oysters were very reasonably priced (12 for $18). That being said, if you&#39;re the type of person that wants quantity rather than quality, or likes a bunch of bells and whistles on your plate, you will probably be disappointed. The plates are more like fine dining plates which are usually smaller and not the typical American gluttony portions. (I actually thought our servings were quite big compared to other &#34;fine&#34; restaurants I&#39;ve been to recently).",18/12/15,230,5,3,5,57,6.033099999999999,2.702,0.241,13.056,No,1946

We also ordered a Seared Ahi Sandwich with Wasabi Mayo and a Crab Cake Sandwich with Garlic Mayo. Both were incredibly fresh and incredibly tasty. It gave us nice combo of savory and sweet(er).

The Seared Ahi was a little bit thinner than I am used to, but no complaints because of the taste. The Wasabi Mayo had the great wasabi taste, but not the kick, which is good or bad depending on who you ask.

The Crab Cake sandwich was my favorite. The crab cake itself was flavorful and had a good amount of crab in it.

I took my wife here for our 22nd wedding anniversary.
I thought it&#39;d be a nice evening for us both after a long day of spending time together and taking care of some errands.

I called to ask if reservations is necessary since it&#39;s Friday evening in St. Charles. I was glad to hear we&#39;re going to have a table at 8p.

My wife and I arrive in St. Charles and it took as a while to find the place.  E &amp; S Seafood is located in a strip mall area.  It&#39;s not visible if you&#39;re coming North on Rt 31.

My wife and I went around and eventually found it.

Parking area was not full. 

Looking at the restaurant, it looked nice.  Only two tables were occupied.

By the time we got to the door and opened it, the couple from the other table were leaving.

We entered the restaurant and was greeted by, I&#39;m not sure what his role is in the restaurant, a young man.
He showed us a table that was in an odd location.
I immediately noticed a hand sanitizer dispenser behind where my wife would sit.
I didn&#39;t even sit down. I immediately asked if we can sit somewhere else.  It is our wedding anniversary...  I&#39;d like to sit on a table for two.  I pointed to the table located close to the window and we&#39;re moved, no problem.

We sat and we&#39;re approached by another young man.  He gave us a menu with very limited items to choose from.

I asked him what sort of thing can they do with the fish I&#39;m interested in ordering. He was not very knowledgeable.

I asked him what fish he&#39;d recommend for the evening.  He just said &#34;Tuna&#34;.
He didn&#39;t go through what&#39;s available for the evening, how it can be prepared, what comes with the dish, etc...  I was stunned.
He explained a little what we can do but explained it poorly.
My wife and I were left to figure things out.

For starters, I ordered 1/2 dozen raw oysters.
The oysters arrived on a bed of ice with a bit of horseradish and cocktail sauce in small sauce servings.
Oysters were delicious.

Next, we ordered the Scallop dish and the Chilean Sea Bass.
My wife liked her Scallop dish. I liked my Chilean Sea Bass dish.
I asked for rice with my fish. I received mashed potatoes for my side dish along with asparagus and veggies.  I didn&#39;t ask to correct it.

So, we received a few slices of bread with more than regular butter + a serving of side salad with ranch and a small bowl of Seafood Chowder + our entrees + no dessert + just water...  How much do you think was our bill for the night?..  Almost $90 with tip!..

Food tasted good...  Maybe even very good...  But the experience, the service...  For the price I paid, it&#39;s high...

It had been so depressing to come back to the midwest and be stuck with paying for average &#34;restaurant-chain&#34; seafood. That is of course until we heard about E&amp;S Fish Market (formerly known as Diamond Seafood).
We have been there for lunch several Saturdays this year already. It feels as if this is our private little &#34;fisherman&#39;s warf&#34; in our backyard. We have not been to a dinner service yet, because we have been that happy with the lunch selections, price, quality, and unpretentious feel of experience. We always have a habit of purchasing a fresh selection for us to prepare at home later in the evening. We do plan to find a sitter for the little guy so that we can come by for one of Ernesto&#39;s dinner services, because his FB posts look so amazing!!!!!!
I have had the blackened grouper sandwich, salmon burger (I hate salmon but this is actually quite wonderful), halibut, crab cake, and the fish taco which were all out of this world (or at least way out of the midwest). This weekend I know that I am going to get the scallops for lunch because I saw them being prepared for another customer last week and I was jealous. 
I would love to see E&amp;S on the TV show - Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.... but not because it falls into any of those categories.

St. Charles really needed a seafood restaurant because Red Lobster doesn&#39;t count and we need another sushi place like a hole in the head. I know we have St. Charles Place but this place is a little more casual. It can be a little pricey but your paying for what you get here.

There&#39;s nothing I love more than to try a new restaurant and be overjoyed at how superb it was.  That&#39;s how I felt after dinner at Diamond&#39;s Seafood in St. Charles.  My wife and I met some friends for dinner on Friday night.  Our friends have raved about Diamond&#39;s for a while now.  They say they have the best fish tacos around.  I&#39;ll have to try them next time I&#39;m looking for some good grub for lunch.  

But anyway, going in we had no idea what to expect.  Diamond&#39;s is located in an unassuming strip mall near downtown St. Charles.  It&#39;s a cash and carry fish market by day serving up quick service lunch.  But on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights Diamond&#39;s opens their doors for dinner.  There are literally 6 tables in the place with one table dedicated to a party of 6-8.  The rest of 2 and 4 tops.  So if you plan on going you MUST make a reservation.  

They don&#39;t serve alcohol so come prepared with your favorite bottle of wine or six pack of beer.  They don&#39;t charge a corkage fee either.  This is a humble operation that is truly a family owned business.  I really thought it was extra special when our water was served by the sweetest little girl after we were seated.  She couldn&#39;t have been older than 10 tops.  

As for the menu...it usually changes all the time.  There&#39;s a limited number of entrees to choose from but enough to make even the pickiest of eaters happy.  The food consists mostly of fish and other seafood delights (i.e. shrimp, crab, lobster, etc..).  I ordered the potato encrusted Striped Bass.  It was cooked to perfection and served with a light sauce that didn&#39;t over power the freshness of the fish.  In fact, everyone&#39;s entree was prepared with care and attention to detail.  It&#39;s hard to believe they can pull this off with such a limited staff but they do.  I must warn you though.  Don&#39;t expect to be able to get in and out of this place in under an hour.  It&#39;ll be tough.  Just sit back and relax with your friends, family, loved one, whatever.  Most of all enjoy the simplicity of Diamond&#39;s Seafood.  Appreciate the uncomplicated menu and effort and true pride the owners take in preparing each and every plate with care.  

I got the sense this is a place where locals tend to gravitate to.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s a unknown secret in the Fox Valley except for the fact that all the tables were full the entire time we were there.  Like I said...make reservations.  

I should mention that despite the location (i.e. strip mall) and the fact that Diamond&#39;s is basically a takeout seafood market by day they really do a good job converting the dining area at night.  White table cloths, flowers and candles, and decent lighting.  

If you love fresh seafood and fish and like a place where you can bring your own bottle of wine/beer then you really need to get to Diamond&#39;s Seafood in St. Charles.  You won&#39;t be disappointed.  In fact you&#39;ll be coming back again.  I know I will!!",08/03/10,329,4,2,5,28,12.095500000000003,7.098000000000001,1.323,33.579,No,3048

Fortunately the ACK was, and despite not being very hungry after a full breakfast, we still managed to find room for dessert. Side note: the &#34;eat dessert first&#34; motto was noted and is one I strive to live by.

Upon entering, we were greeted by chocolate sculptures (that tree - wow!) and sugar art, as well as enticing display cases of any number of pastries, desserts, candies and gelato. We faced a difficult decision. Since we weren&#39;t terribly hungry, it was tempting to get something on the lighter side. But after much debate, it ultimately seemed wrong to not get something chocolatey at the ACK, and we settled on the &#34;as seen on tv&#34; Devil&#39;s Food Cake. Oh my goodness. It was amazing and lives up to it&#39;s reputation. Hey, if it&#39;s good enough for Martha, it&#39;s good enough for me.

The very rich chocolate cake and mousse were well balanced by a raspberry sauce and whipped cream. There is an option for a la mode, but I thought that might have been pushing our waistbands a bit too much. We sat at an indoor table to take a break from the humidity, but there is outdoor sidewalk seating if that&#39;s your thing. The cake was so friggin good that it truly was a challenge to eat slowly and savor the flavors. Afterwards, we actually had to lounge on one of the couches to digest and occupied ourselves for a while by reading about the owner and his varied accomplishments.

They have quite a variety of desserts, chocolates &amp; gelato to choose from in addition to a few savory options with flatbreads, etc.  We shared the Turtle Cheesecake which was delicious and the caramel drizzled on it was top notch, too.  

I was a bit disappointed the table-side siphon coffee service is apparently only for 4 servings &amp; not available for 2.  Since we didn&#39;t want to overload on coffee we each ordered an individual beverage instead.  I had the Grand Cru Mocha &amp; to me it was seriously heavy on the mocha side and not far from drinking hot chocolate - I guess when you are at a place called All Chocolate Kitchen I shouldn&#39;t be complaining about something like that, though.",03/05/16,78,3,2,3,16,2.0447,1.085,0.16,3.755,No,805

Decided that Geneva was next so I looked to Yelp to find a spot for Sunday brunch. Apparently everyone in Geneva was out this past Sunday because every breakfast place was crowded. Normally I don&#39;t mind but I had my impatient 3 year old with me. ACK was serving brunch, good reviews and they weren&#39;t as crowded. We walked in and I was pleasantly surprised that it&#39;s a cute and spacious place. There&#39;s all sort of seating, couches, tables, and the cute decorations. They have statues made out of chocolate. There&#39;s coffee bean center pieces on the table. Their brunch menu is limited to omelets,crepes and waffles. I ordered a mushroom and cheddar omelet, my bf got the salmon omelet and for my little one we ordered the Nutella crepe. Both omelets came with a hot delicious roll and a side of tomato. My omelet was very good and my boyfriend really liked his salmon omelet. 
Their drink menu offers everything from all sorts of coffee to delicious hot chocolate and your regular soft drinks and juices. I went with an iced matcha tea and it was absolutely delicious. I didn&#39;t expect it to taste good considering the girl behind the counter had no idea what I had ordered, lol. 
They also serve ice cream, gelato, pastries and chocolates galore.
I liked that this place was very kid friendly. We will be back real soon to get the gelato and coffee.",08/03/16,166,4,2,5,33,5.3168999999999995,2.882,0.503,15.614,No,1475

Not much of an issue since I knew it would be pricey, but it just was not worth it. The devil&#39;s food cake and the apple brioche were both (sadly) under par for what they should have been. I think they had been sitting out most of the day (I arrived there around 1pm). Their caramel sauce and whipped cream were about the only 2 amazing things there. I was expecting a more dense/moist/rich/indulgent slice of heaven, but what I got was dry and lacking in a rich chocolate flavor. My mom had the apple brioche, and it was like a workout trying to cut through the thing! Trying to chew it wasn&#39;t easy either. We sampled a bit of mango peach gelato. Smart idea, because it was syrupy and overly sweet. For all of the fame and glory and being on Food Network, etc., I really wish ACK had lived up to it&#39;s reputation.

all-chocolate-kitchen-geneva-3,Amanda O.,mSSRX_XWF31iVl5oAiC1Ow,LrgZE3HPXlB3ztWkl6laJQ,"I have visited the All Chocolate Kitchen three times now - twice with the kids.  I have not been disappointed at All Chocolate Kitchen, and have enjoyed myself any time I have gone.  The dining area is large enough that - even on a busy weekend - finding seating wasn&#39;t an issue.  One of the first things you&#39;ll notice when you enter All Chocolate Kitchen are the giant sculptures made entirely of chocolate.  I loved the giant tree in the middle, where even the counter was made up entirely of sugar.

Then, there&#39;s the desserts.  If I&#39;m honest, choosing what you want and finding a spot to order can be a bit confusing.  There are lots of employees behind the counters, but patrons walking around deciding on what they want to order and lines of people waiting for a particular counter can cause a bit of a crowd near the desserts so it&#39;s hard to find what you want and where to stand to order.  My first time there I was a little lost, but got the hang of it for my second go-round.  Walking around, you&#39;ll see what I&#39;m talking about, and you&#39;ll also want to eat evert dessert you see.  It&#39;s definitely a chocolate lovers&#39; heaven!

The gelato station looked amazing, and you are allowed two samples per visit.  All the flavors are yummy, but my favorite is the coconut.  The All Chocolate Kitchen offers crepes on Saturday nights. I love the banana and Nutella crepe. It&#39;s pure heaven.  It comes with a shot of Apple Cider too.  My daughter loves the Devil&#39;s Food Cake, as seen on the Martha Stewart Show.  It was served with a raspberry puree and was extremely rich and decadent.  Anytime you can please a picky teenager is a small victory if you ask me!

While the desserts at All Chocolate Kitchen are undoubtedly mouthwatering and delicious, my favorite item on the menu is their Mocha Coffee.  Served in an oversized coffee mug, the flavor of the Mocha is out-of-this-world chocolaty and the best I&#39;ve tried.  A must for me every time I visit now.  

Bottom line? If you&#39;re a chocolate fan, you must try the All Chocolate Kitchen in Geneva.",23/01/15,227,5,2,5,23,8.236,4.675,0.223,20.102,No,2104

I spent a few minutes walking around, checking out all the fine and beautifully crafted chocolates available, as well as the rest of their desserts.  I initially skipped the gelato because of the line, but man was I glad I changed my mind! You can taste two different flavors before ordering, so I tried the tiramisu (which I thought I would order) and the Super Chocolate sorbetto (which I was just trying for fun - it was dairy-, fat- and gluten-free, so how good could it be?). 

DUDE. If you are a fan of dark chocolate - not that 50% nonsense, but more like 70% - you have to try the Super Chocolate sorbetto! It was amazing! Tasted like a cold, creamy dark chocolate ganache in a bowl. 

There are some...interesting chocolate and sugar sculptures around, which are actually kind of cool to check out. It does add to a kind of confusing/eclectic decor and ambiance - it being a Saturday night, I saw a mix of dressed-up dates, girls-night-out types, and multigenerational families.

Sad but true. But if I did like chocolate, this is where I&#39;d come. I don&#39;t often use the word charming in life or in my reviews, but this place has charming down to a T. Even the bathroom is cozy and inviting. 

Huge cases of chocolates and truffles greet you, crystal chandeliers overhead, a fireplace and tv. It doesn&#39;t get more charming than this. And the employees are polite and friendly.

I love to drop by while I am out running errands solo, and sit by the red sugar lamp and watch out of the window while sipping on my cappuccino and enjoying a treat.  The best espresso anywhere around!!!  Makes for great shots of espresso, cappuccino, and of course their decadent mocha!  I have yet to try the truffles.  I absolutely love all of the croissants- traditional butter, chocolate and almond- by far some of the very best I have ever had!!!  The giant chocolate chip cookies are excellent and quite a hit at my house.  The gelato is superb!  The whole family loves their gelato.  I recently purchased a jar of raspberry chocolate spread, but have yet to try it.  I have tried a few of the desserts now.. which overall are good.  Though some for me are a bit dry by late afternoon.  I tried the strawberry shortcake on Tuesday with a scoop of gelato and it was quite delicious.  I would come in more frequently if it was closer to my house, at the very least 3 times a week(and honestly 5+ days a week if it was close to my house or work just for the espresso!).  We are all very much looking forward to coming in for brunch on some Sunday morning as well.  I have read several reviews about poor service which I really hate to hear.

Everything here, from the ice cream/gelato, to the delectable devil&#39;s food cake, to the golden hot chocolate (made with honey) is exquisite. Their chantilly cream is the best I have had outside of Europe, and their raspberry coulis is...perfection. Really.

(I shouldn&#39;t say &#34;everything&#34; because there is one menu item that I can&#39;t get over: the linguette, which is very savory, but loaded with too much salt.)

The restaurant is decorated with chocolate - what else? There is a large, perhaps 15-20 foot chocolate tree, complete with elves&#39; doors, in the center of the room, and two chocolate creations in the fashion of an Neil Armstrong and a Chicago Blackhawks player at the entrance. Television screens broadcast Chef Roby breaking various Guinness book world records, including last year&#39;s largest candy cane.

all-chocolate-kitchen-geneva-3,Nicole B.,XJYFjbH-oTmu2dATTqyauQ,YUENdgwGye4kdbnPOqFbmA,"My aunt, cousin, and I were walking around downtown Geneva and decided to take a look at one of the older buildings. I&#39;m glad we did because we came across this little slice of heaven. The name and catchphrase pretty much sums it up - All Chocolate Kitchen &#34;Eat Dessert First&#34;. 

If I could eat dessert all day, I would. Fortunately, this place says it&#39;s okay to do that! Inside, it is very cute and quaint with tables and chairs and a sectioned off room for a more private experience. They have multiple display cases with numerous different chocolate items. Chocolate from around the world with different flavors and goodies mixed in. Two different types of chocolate smoothies AND a full gelato bar. Then, a display case filled with numerous chocolate pieces and truffles. Finally, a case with tons of baked goods - bread pudding, brownies, cookies, crÌ¬me brulee, crÌ¬me de pots - basically all the delicious. They even serve crepes and pizza/bruschetta here, on top of coffee and other specialty drinks. 

It was really difficult to decide what to get, so I tried a little bit from each display case so I could share. I got some chocolate pieces/truffles, chocolate bread pudding, and a single scoop of coffee gelato. The coffee gelato was really smooth and tasty, but it didn&#39;t have that coffee kick that I&#39;m used to at The Gelato Spot in my hometown of Arizona. It was still delicious and both my aunt and cousin really enjoyed their gelato. 

The bread pudding was good but the top had a clear gelatinous layer which made it not my favorite. (After sticking my finger in the gelatinous layer I deduced it was some sort of orange gelatin. I hate chocolate and orange together, so I quickly scraped this off.) I reheated my bread pudding in the microwave for about one minute or so. I put a scope of vanilla ice cream on top and dug in. I could still taste the orange, so I dug around to the bottom of the bread pudding. This was good and chocolatey. Not sure if I would get another one of these, unless there was no orange gelatin.

The chocolates were good and chocolatey. The pieces I got were espresso (my favorite), amaretto (good), sea salt caramel (pretty good), and one other (can&#39;t remember but it was good). I&#39;d definitely get the espresso one again - the other ones were good but the espresso was delicious. 

Overall, it was a great experience - so good I came back again! My second trip included purchasing a slice of devil&#39;s food cake and an Irish Cream Latte. OH MAN. The latte was killer - it really hit the spot and was the best latte I&#39;ve had in a while. Then, the cake... oh, oh. This was surely a slice of heaven. Some chocolate cakes are really hit and miss but this was a home-run-out-of-the-ball-park hit. I would order an entire cake and eat it without sharing. A definite winning combo and I&#39;ll certainly be back.",09/07/13,349,5,3,5,84,6.9251000000000005,5.299,1.273,29.427,No,2888

I wasn&#39;t sure what to get so I got a few truffles and they were all gorgeous looking and absolutely delicious! I was super full from dinner so I knew I wanted something light and fluffy so I decided to sample one of their gelatos. The sweet girl working there recommended the dark chocolate one which was gluten free, lactose free, something else except not free. It was amazing, super airy and light and I loved it! I mean I got only one scoop that was under $4 and I regret not getting two because I swallowed it up in like two minutes. You must get it and if I&#39;m in the area again I am definitely getting it whether its summer or winter, it goes down very well.

My hubby wanted something more filling so he went with the key lime pie and I had a few bites of it and it was also super yummy. It had a layer of chocolate crust on the bottom so although key lime pie is not my favorite dessert, the fact that it had that extra layer of chocolate made it much more amazing!

Our friends also got some chocolate pie dessert as well as hot chocolate and they seemed to enjoy everything. I thought that the prices were decent, the variety was endless and the people working there are super friendly or at least the girl at the gelato counter.

I ordered two scoops of gelato in a warm croissant, forgot to write what they call it. The server told me to pay and to look around that she would bring me my gelato to my seat. I paid and left a dollar tip. 

After a minute or two, I was approached and was told that there were no more croissants, she asked me what she could do for me. I told her that I was not picky and told her to surprise me. I figured with all the beautiful things I was seeing it would be easy for her to throw in a cookie or something.

I was brought a tiramisu to which she added was fairly new to them. 

I did not like the tiramisu and never got my gelato. Not sure what I was supposed to do.

It blew us out of the water! It has such a great ambiance about the place, a couple couches and tables. It was so cozy and inviting to just be inside. The service was great too! They must be used to getting first time customers in awe and they were so patient and very informative (which is obviously so helpful).

I got gelato and some truffles which were amazing, and my boyfriend got this berry cobbler with sweet cream gelato on top which was also amazing! Their truffles were the kind you see on the Food Network, they were little pieces of art and I almost felt bad for eating them. 

As we were enjoying the berry cobbler that they had warmed up for us we decided to look at their website on our phones. We had no idea that this Chef Roby was so, well, famous. I was so impressed by everything that he&#39;s accomplished and there he was, on a Saturday, just baking away in the kitchen! It really shows that he has something he loves especially being there on a Saturday. I really do applaud someone like that, who has accomplished so much and has something that they truly enjoy doing.

I mean, seriously. I was wandering Geneva with an old friend, who&#39;s pregnant with her first baby, we&#39;d had some Mexican food and poked around the Little Traveler. It was a lovely warm day: time for gelato. Time for (dun dun dun) All. Chocolate. Kitchen.

This place is bigger than I thought it would be (plenty of seats to enjoy your goodies), and it&#39;s not precisely true that everything is chocolate. They did have some non-chocolate gelato and sorbet, various coffee drinks, and they now offer crepes (sweet and savory, I believe) in the evenings.

But yeah, it&#39;s mostly a chocolate wonderland.

My friend indulged with a cookies and cream gelato, and I went for the super-rich, dark, slightly bitter dark chocolate salted truffle. Oh my heavens. The portion is not huge, but you don&#39;t need a lot -- it&#39;s very satisfying, smooth, creamy and cold.

I don&#39;t get to Geneva nearly as often as I&#39;d like, but ACK, you are competing heavily with my old favorite, Graham&#39;s 318... I may have to come back more often to continue taste-testing and see which one is my favorite ;)",20/05/13,153,5,1,4,5,3.7342,2.244,0.8859999999999999,10.871,No,1191

Come ready with insulin in hand, your blood sugar&#39;s about to reach abnormally high levels!

I come for the gelato.  Thick, creamy, milky gelato.  My favorites here include but are not limited to:  hazelnut, pistachio, and stracciatella.  Flavors here are never tainted with freezer burn.  Gelato is freshly made and stays that way until closing time.

Feeling up to a challenge?  You can go Man vs. Food at this dessert establishment by ordering their gelato avalanche ($23.99) that consists of 3 pints of gelato served in  an oversized martini glass.

all-chocolate-kitchen-geneva-3,Andrew J.,HhBaavr8N_1DYclbr3xpvQ,EnM3ExBWtwZ5SW63KVTS1w,"Hasn&#39;t everyone at one time or another wished they could own a place like this? I know I have- especially before I was married and was trying to think of more reputable ways to meet beautiful women other than at bars. A chic cafe that specializes in chocolate and dessert in a trendy shopping area? Yes please. Writing this actually makes me wonder if Chef Roby has a lot of stalkers. It would stand to reason if he did because this place is really amazing on many levels, and is totally worth many frequent visits and/or wide-eyed stares through the windows. 

Now that I am happily married to my beautiful wife, All Chocolate Kitchen serves another, far, far more important function; namely, promoting marital happiness outside of our household. If you are married or dating, I would consider this a prime &#34;lock your relationship down&#34; location. Not only will All Chocolate Kitchen ensure culinary amazement and bliss, it will ensure that you will forever be associated with selecting only the very best for those you care about. It is amazing how much power of persuasion there is in a slice of fine chocolate cake.

Speaking of which, the devil&#39;s food cake is utterly incredible. Light and fluffy, but also surprisingly decadent, the devil&#39;s food cake is served with a dollop of real whipped cream and a tart raspberry sauce that will leave you gasping for joy. I&#39;d say give it a try. And you know who else says the same thing? Martha Stewart, who apparently featured this very confection on television. I&#39;m not a huge Martha Stewart fan, but she got this one right for sure.

As long as you are giving that a try, you might as well also try the key lime pie, which is sweet and tart and features a chocolate graham cracker crust. In the words of Will Farrell, &#34;That&#39;s how babies are made.&#34; He wasn&#39;t talking about this pie in the movie I am thinking of, but I believe that he would endorse it if he got the chance. It&#39;s a guess, but when you try it you will see that literally anyone would endorse it, so, as usual, I am right again. Have it with some coffee, because the coffee is also top of the line. 

Are there other things to eat at the all chocolate kitchen? Yes. So many things. There are lots of other desserts (including phenomenal gelato) but there are also savory options as well if you feel absurd going somewhere just for dessert (what is WRONG with you???). I did not partake in any of these options, but they also look quality too. It is unlikely that Chef Roby would put his name on a building, go on Food Network and popular TV shows, and then fail to make a quality soup or sandwich. That would be foolhardy.

The service is also top notch. It&#39;s fast and friendly, and why wouldn&#39;t it be? The baristas work in a dessert cafe where people come to indulge and leave happy. Also, they work in a beautiful space. The cafe atmosphere is trendy and warm with soft seating and tables amongst enormous chocolate sculptures and blown sugar lights. It&#39;s lovely.

This is the place you want to go if you&#39;re looking to have a special afternoon or evening, bring a guest from out of town, or just quietly indulge and relax all by yourself. While I can&#39;t guarantee an experience that will make you a stalker of Chef Roby, you&#39;ll definitely be a fan of this cafe. 

Maybe they should hire a bouncer just in case.",08/04/14,378,5,2,5,31,11.837399999999999,7.611000000000001,0.9449999999999998,28.443999999999996,No,3393

Second, 3 stars for the &#34;restaurant&#34; part of what they are doing.

*Strains of &#34;With or Without You&#34; and &#34;Should I stay or Should I Go&#34; and &#34;Hand in My Pocket&#34; went through my head as I left.
*Is it a cafe or is it a restaurant? It isn&#39;t sure.
*The gelato was excellent as usual.
*I asked if we could get our plates cleared. We were done, we wanted dessert, our plates just sat there...empty...waiting for someone to get them.
*Our food came to the table without silverware or napkins.
*The tea was served with nowhere to put the tea bag after the tea had steeped.
*We sat there for quite a while waiting for the waitress to come by and take our order. But...she wasn&#39;t a waitress, she was only disguised as one! She was a food deliverer, but not an order-taker. Silly us for not recognizing the difference.

So, that&#39;s how it went. The quiche? 5 stars. The service? Also 5 stars once we figured out things. Taylor is a great assistant manager, it was really user error on our part that caused all the confusion.

So, bottom line? Walk in, look at the food in the cases, get someone&#39;s attention, order the food, and go sit down. Most likely it will get delivered to your table with a smile and you&#39;ll love it. When you are done, bring the dishes up yourself...or, just ask them to clear the table, then go and order dessert.

I was looking for a restaurant near O&#39;Hare because I was picking someone up and they had a evening flight and wanted to eat beforehand and be nearby.

I am SO glad I did, but I only wish that this restaurant was closer to my house - it is nearly an hour one way...

The service was good, not great, but the food more than made up for it.  The fresh spring rolls were very flavorful and the dipping sauce had a nice kick to it.  My Panang Curry (tofu) had a good flavor, but the spicy level was determined by the staff, thinking that I might not want it too spicy (they tend to be on the spicy side, they said).  It had some heat, but I wanted more, they brought me a spice tray, but it is not the same as having the spice bloom in the cooking process.

My daughter had Pad See Ewe and the flavor was nice and didn&#39;t have the &#39;standard&#39; dark brown gravy, the sauce was tan in color, but much more flavorful with notes of black pepper.",25/11/15,108,5,2,4,26,3.3119000000000005,1.7430000000000003,0.131,6.1259999999999994,No,1005

Spring Rolls were so-so. Good wrapper but the 33% cucumber log was out of balance. I&#39;d skip it.

Pad Thai was pretty good. Medium spicy is on par with real Thai as it&#39;s hot for the white folk...

The lunch special soup is like a bouillon cube broth with a bit of tofu and a couple shredded veggies...

The Crab Rangoon (I think that&#39;s what it was) had all cream cheese and maybe some crab flavor. The shell was nice and crispy.

What separates Yupin from every othe Thai restaurant  is the owner is Thai themselves  and the food is as authentic as they come. Someone else on the previous review said that the food was like street vendor  food that you get in Thailand. I&#39;ve never been to Thailand so I don&#39;t know. My mom though is from Thailand and the food that she makes enough at home is the same food that you get at this restaurant.

1. The soup was basically chicken broth in a bowl with some veggies/ tofu thrown in. Pretty average.

2. The egg roll was good, but so tiny! 

On top of the lunch special, I ordered Crab Rangoon because I&#39;ve heard great things (which are true!) My fresh out of the deep-fryer steaming bundles of cream cheese and crab were soooo good! Crispy breading with significant filling. 

The Pad Thai was on par as well. The right amount of sauce to noodle ratio with peanuts on the side so you could add as many as you wanted. I wish there were more green things i.e. cilantro, lime, bean sprouts (is that Americanized Thai?) Bonus: I ordered a medium level of spice which helped clear up my stuffy nose. 

I would suggest just ordering the main dish instead of the lunch special because they do their main dishes really well. The waitresses were attentive but very busy. Lunch took me about an hour.",25/08/15,137,4,2,5,31,5.274699999999999,3.3500000000000005,0.052,11.598,No,1025

After eating at Yupin Thai, the search is over.

The little jars of spices they bring to the table is a perfect representation of the restaurant. The sauce they said was similar to Sriracha sauce was the mild sauce. The sauce that they consider hot is made there with chiles that they grow themselves! They also bring a sugar bowl because, they said, most Thai restaurants here offer sweeter dishes to suit the American tastes, but they make the dishes more traditionally so some people like to add sugar.

I added nothing, and it was perfect.

Before ordering, we asked the waitress what spice level was equal to a buffalo wing. She said she didn&#39;t know that buffalo wings were supposed to be spicy, so I decided I should go for the mild, which had a nice, subtle burn. My boyfriend opted for hot, and it was exactly what he wanted -- hot but with a lot of great flavor throughout the dish. We also got egg rolls, which seemed very fresh.

Before we even got to my car, my boyfriend was talking about which dish he wanted to try next time. We will be back. Highly recommended.",05/03/14,140,5,2,4,11,3.549699999999999,1.952,0.0,12.048,No,1249

The lady that runs Yupin is Thai (!), she cooks while her 3 daughters take care of the service. 
They explained to me that their cuisine is authentic, and therefore they do not add sugar to appeal to the American palate. Rather, you can add sugar yourself if you feel like. 
Also a word about the spice level (rewording what others have written). I ignored the &#39;very spicy&#39; warning and regretted it a bit (it was delicious though!). So on my second visit I ordered the spicy stuff on the side, it&#39;s a cool portable tray with 4 dishes: 
one contains sugar, then there is dry spicy chili and seeds, then what looks like sambal oelek (not too spicy), and finally a darker chili and seeds mix that swims in a sauce and it tastes smoky, and is very spicy. When they say spicy they mean it so beware, whitey. 

After 2 visits I can say I will become a regular. They&#39;re close to where I work and at these prices why not indulge?! 
I found the service to be excellent and very attentive.

Don&#39;t spend your time with other sushi places in Crystal lake. I&#39;ve thoroughly tested all of them. Kumi is the best for NW burbs.

LOTS to choose from and no doubt everything made fresh.  My biz colleague had sushi and I had udon noodles.   Quick and painlessly the food arrived. 

Well done.

Side note, a lot of family places like this don&#39;t take AMX (I suppose AMX takes a a high % so I get it), these nice people do take AMX.

kumi-sushi-crystal-lake,Mike S.,arp-UJ5f0kMN47oKuMak3w,R8M0WogD5ZOuu_udpwR7Tg,"First of all, the food is excellent. They have some very unique rolls and I&#39;m slowly working my way down the menu and have yet to be disappointed by the sushi here. The last roll I had was the Crystal Lake roll. It is truly fantastic. I can&#39;t remember all the names of others but try to work my way down the list. Its clear the chefs here are true professionals.
Now, about the 3 stars...
Why can&#39;t a restaurant that obviously puts so much expertise and professionalism into their cuisine also train their staff to be just as professional. I feel like I&#39;m getting the best food but being waited on by college kids just taking a summer job. This seems to be an unfortunate trend with ethnic food. Hire a service trainer and get your service staff up to par PLEASE. I almost always have to flag down wait staff for a refill. By the way I almost always go on a weeknight when its rarely busy so they&#39;re not overwhelmed. In fact the staff is usually standing chatting at the bar or the front counter.
Some tips:
Never let a drink run dry. Refill any &#34;free refill&#34; drink without asking before they&#39;re out. 
Follow up within 3 minutes of delivering the main course. Watch for patrons looking to catch you.
If another server&#39;s table appears to need something or has run dry on drinks, check with them. Don&#39;t wait for their server to wonder by. Good service includes everyone looking out for all customers.
Clear empty plates. Our empty plates sat there all the way through dessert. 

I will be back for the awesome food! Hopefully the service improves and I can edit this review.",06/08/16,177,3,2,5,20,4.065499999999999,3.8849999999999993,0.95,19.163999999999998,No,1612

First off, my bad for not reading the offer in detail, which was only valid Mondays and Wednesdays. So on a Tuesday night, we ordered four rolls...

Mexican Roll - big pieces, nice heat
Alaska Roll - average
Spicy Salmon Roll - lacking spice
Crystal Lake Roll - decent, average

Other than the Mexican roll, there wasn&#39;t much to be impressed by. True, we ordered some of the less complex rolls, but the true quality should shine in the basics. The spicy mayo in the spicy salmon roll, for example, was lacking spice and flavor. I had to use the soy sauce to open it up.

I have stated before that I am not a sushi snob, but I do value the quality in relation to cost. The pricing here just doesn&#39;t match the product.

The service was excellent, and the ambience felt classy and modern. There was a chilling draft when the two doors opened just right. Perhaps if I came in on the proper day and got the discount, this place may have jumped to 4 stars.

The service was excellent, the atmosphere modern and inviting, prices reasonable, and the food phenomenal.

Our server, Brad, was quick, attentive, helpful, and polite. He also made sure we were aware of any extra charges our substitutions might cause, and while we didn&#39;t mind paying a little more at all, we appreciated the heads up!

The salads, crab rangoon, and clear soup were great! All of which we will order again next time we come. The miso soup was good, but was blown out of the water by the clear soup. My boyfriend got the Mongolian beef with fried rice. Best fried rice we&#39;ve ever had. The beef was quite good and he will be ordering that again as well.

As I have mentioned before, I am a bit of a sushi snob.  This restaurant serves sushi that is just okay tasting, but looks beautiful.  The interior is nice looking, very trendy looking.  I was also a bit annoyed that they refused to accept our Yelp check in offer.  They said they wanted it cancelled, so they wouldn&#39;t give us the 20% off.  I mean it is not a big deal, but I feel like to provide good customer service they still should have honored it  They showed us the e-mail communication to Yelp that it was supposed to be taken down.  That was over a month ago and it is still up..  I don&#39;t know if I will go back.",10/11/13,78,3,2,1,39,0.8673,1.46,1.024,6.516,No,712

We have been here several times before over the past year and really liked the place. We like things really spicy and it has never been a problem prior. Sometimes service is a bit slow but they are so nice, (were so nice) you just relax and enjoy yourself....BUT what has happened here?  My brother ordered the Hot Lady Roll (see photos) and ask for it to be super spicy like always.  It came out, we ate it, but no spicy what-so-ever.  We ordered another one and explained to the server that it is ok, we really like spicy things.  She said that the chef&#39;s get nervous making things too hot. We assured her that a ton of jalapenos and wasabi would be awesome in the roll and not to worry.  Apparently the chef got bent out of shape and retaliated by smothering a $15 roll in Sriracha.  We went to the owner and said this was pretty silly and the chefs is making a statement.  Owner said &#34;too bad!&#34;  We also asked for Yellow Tail Sushi and the server said they did not carry it...hummm.  We pointed it out on the Menu to her.  We got the order and the fish was spoiled. 

It goes on and on from there but just typing this is starting to make me mad again so I will end it here.

Something happened to this place and we will never go back again.  Bad behavior by their Chef, I mean cook, by sending out spoiled fish and retaliating with a roll.

I am always a little skeptical of food from restaurants located in strip walls; but this one is one of the &#39;rare&#39; occasions I was wrong.  Although you can enjoy Kumi anytime of day; I&#39;d recommend going for a late dinner.  The atmosphere is awesome

You&#39;ll most likely be surprised by the environment when you first walk in.  They paid a lot of attention to details, and their back lite decorative wall and porcelainosa tiled pillars give you the feeling that you&#39;re in a place you may expect to fork out quite a bit of dough at.

You&#39;d be wrong.  The prices aren&#39;t outrageous; and if you enjoy sushi; you&#39;re most likely familiar with paying a pretty penny to begin with.

The plates are decorative and stylish; it&#39;s clear the chefs give each dish a fair amount of attention.  The taste is amazing; and fresh, and the staff is friendly; although it can be a hit or miss when it comes to getting someone who is well versed with the menu.

When you get someone who knows it front and back; ask questions... they are more than willing to give you a proper answer and their knowledge of the adult beverages comes in handy ;)",25/04/14,129,4,2,4,24,3.7739000000000003,2.399,0.861,6.739999999999999,No,1185

The restaurant was nicely decorated with a modern flare.  There is a sushi bar and open ballroom style seating with almost no booths.  Service was good but no one was at the front to thank us when we left, as they were all gathered by the sushi bar chitchatting.  

Now lets talk about the food...presentation is good and the sashimi combination came in a bowl that was beautifully dressed up with a light buried under ice chips and greens.  Udon was served in a big bowl as well, full of veggies, and flavorful soup stock.

This was our first time trying Kumi Sushi and I believe it is fairly new to town. Walking in the atmosphere is clean and modern but still comfortable. I loved the sushi bar and the huge booths that feature TV screens showing natural scenery and city scenes. The menu is large and features sushi as well as more robust dishes like soba noodles and fried rice. I ordered two different sushi rolls and my husband ordered sashimi and soba noodles. Everything tasted fresh and was nicely presented. I asked for extra ginger because its my jam. The hubs will tell you I only eat sushi for the ginger. Who could blame me?
 
We were also pleasantly surprised that they have week day specials. T/Th is buy one get one cocktails. Twist my arm.  We each enjoyed a Saki Martini. They were very light and slightly sweet and extremely refreshing. If they had this special on a Friday they would start to get very sick of seeing me overindulge myself on Saki Martinis every week. There were thin slices of cucumber in each drink and I loved that extra bit of freshness. 

Now comes the part where you might think I am being a jerk. I noticed the manager showed a lot of attention to a couple that seemed to be regulars but he did not walk around to the other tables. He even gave this couple several samples of the special rolls. Like I said, it was a Tuesday and it was really cold out so there were only half a dozen tables with customers. I thought it would have been really nice if he would have greeted each table and maybe shared 1 piece of the special roll with each of us.  With extra ginger of course. I know, I know, I am demanding! 

Nonetheless, I will be back to pay my dues and work my way up the regulars totem poll to earn my prize of 2 extra pieces of sushi! With extra ginger.",10/02/14,211,4,3,5,53,6.381000000000001,3.945,1.2329999999999999,20.822,No,1832

I had the lunch special maki combo, with eel avocado and a Philly roll. A very good lunch for under $10.

Then we went to dinner there on a Saturday.  I don&#39;t like the modern dance club &#34;New York&#34; look and how they have to mention it several times on their site.  You&#39;re in front of Wal-Mart, don&#39;t act like you&#39;re introducing us to some amazing new atmosphere.

They&#39;ve been open several months but the server was just plain awkward and confused.  We ordered a tofu appetizer and he asked if we wanted soup and salad with it. There is no agedashi entree plus we prefaced it with &#34;we&#39;ll start with the agedashi tofu appetizer&#34; so there should have been no confusion.  My husband had the Chirashi which was very tasty he says and well portioned.  HOWEVER, because of the awkward server he never got his soup or salad that came with it.  Because apparently when we had to explain the tofu was an appetizer and didn&#39;t come with soup or salad, that apparently meant we didn&#39;t want what came with our entrees at all.  You don&#39;t go there for the miso and bagged lettuce but if you pay for something it should be given to you.

I had another eel avocado roll and a Dragon roll.  The specialty rolls were small compared to other restaurants but tasted fresh and they had a lot of specialties to choose from.  The server brought my rolls out before the tofu even arrived, so it just sat there as it was my entree not an appetizer.  The tofu was tasteless and the sauce was also.

You want small, thin slices.  What he got were hunks of fish.  He said that he wouldn&#39;t order sashimi again.  My entree was good.  The dressing they used on the salad was awesome.  The steak was cooked perfect.  My only complaint was that they cut the vegetables thin so it was really hard to pick up with a fork or chopsticks.  The miso soup was good.  

On to the service.  Everyone was nice, and we were checked upon a couple of times.  However, it took 15 min for my husband to get his drink.  It took 3 people to figure out how to make it.  It was one of the drinks that was on their menu so it&#39;s not like he asked them to do something special.  I just had hot tea and they were a little lax about checking to see if I needed a top off.  Then it suddenly became uncomfortable.  Our waiter checked up on us and started a conversation with us. Our waiter had moved here from one of the Carolinas.  He asked us about the area and how we liked it and what is there to do around here.  He then started inquiring about other restaurants, specifically, Kyoto, which was not to far from this place on Rt. 14.  he asked about the food, and then their hours.  We didn&#39;t think much about it at that given moment.  We figured just asking about the competitor.  

He asked my husband if he wanted another drink, which my husband ordered a beer.  He left, came back with the beer, and started asking more questions about Kyoto.  He asked if it was busy, he then asked about their wait staff, which we replied we did not know anything.  He asked if they had lunch hours, we replied that we didn&#39;t know.  Then he flat out asked if we knew if they were accepting applications. My husband and I just looked at each other.  We replied that we have no clue and that maybe he needs to call over there.  

I was kind of offended by this.  We were trying to eat our meal, and have a conversation with each other and this guy was trying to get information about a possible job prospect.  It made me question what is up with this place if this guy is hovering over us asking these questions. 

I really should give this place 2 stars because of this particular waiter, but the food was not bad.  My entree was pretty good, and my husband&#39;s only complaint was that the pieces of fish were hunks but it was fresh.  Had we not gotten interrogated I would have liked to given it 3 1/2-4 stars and just said the service was a little slow.  Because of this waiter, we probably won&#39;t be back.",18/06/13,294,3,1,4,-74,3.6221,3.6439999999999997,1.476,35.881,No,2913

I was really nervous to try &#34;Crystal Lake&#34; sushi. WOW!! I was so impressed! Super good! Our table ordered edamame, 5 different rolls, sobe with chicken, and teryiaki steak. We were not disappointed! The only thing I wasnt a fan of was the Miso soup, but that&#39;s only because I don&#39;t like Miso. Entrees come with both soup and salad. At the end of the meal, they bring you fresh orange wedges. So perfect and refreshing. The decor could have been done a little better. It was kind of cheesy and the corner by the bathroom had a bunch of junk piled up. Usually Japanese restaurants are very clean and minimalistic. Theres a counter by the chefs that you can eat at and watch them prepare the food. There&#39;s also a little bar area. Big sake list. We didn&#39;t have any. Rolls were so fresh and YUMMY. Sauces were full of flavor. My fave of the night was the 2013 roll. So happy to have you, Kumi!",01/06/14,119,5,2,5,32,5.639,5.969,0.472,15.559,No,983

The decor inside is modern and very cool. You forget you&#39;re in the NW &#39;burbs.

Specific favorites on the menu: the crazy salmon roll is awesome - my favorite roll. I&#39;ve had the salmon, yellowtail, and tuna sashimi, which has always been fresh and very good. Surprisingly, the beef fried rice is way better than Chinese restaurants in the area. No joke - it&#39;s delicious.

kumi-sushi-crystal-lake,Shea W.,D-yA1RWuAE-xrV05O4-BtA,k5Dk_5OtHt6nyJ01N8VRbA,"Went in for a lunch and tried a small spread of dishes. 

Food: For the nigiri/sushi, I had the eel, smoked salmon, and white tune. Of the three I would say the eel was the fish that needed the most work. The smoked salmon looked dry, but still had a delicious, smokey flavor after biting into it - as anticipated. Its presentation was nice to someone that is new to sushi cuisine and may not like the look of wet, cold fish on top of rice. The white tuna fell in the middle of the three. I normally have a strong taste of butter when I eat white tuna, but I only had a small hint of that flavor.

For the rolls, I had an eel+cucumber roll and shrimp tempura roll (yes, simple). The eel roll was slightly above average. Definitely something you could give to someone that has never had a sushi restaurant experience and get them hooked. The shrimp tempura was VERY well done. The tempura was light in color, very flaky, and warm as I bit into it.

If your a ginger snob they serve white ginger. 

Drinks: The water was great, but plenty of alcoholic options.

Service: had to wait about 10 seconds for someone to seat me. I was surprised that no one was at the front desk. I was seated, per my choice, at the sushi bar and from that point on I had plenty of attention during my meal. None of my orders had errors in them. 

Atmosphere: As other review say, it looks club-like. As a matter of fact I felt under dressed walking in with a t shirt, basketball shorts, and flip flops...which really is under dressed, but the look of the place made me feel even more under dressed. I&#39;m not a big stick on what a restaurant looks like on the inside. As long as it appears to be clean and the food is good, I&#39;ll most likely come back... even if the service kills the place (which was not the case during this review). Aside the club-like atmosphere, the male to female ratio during lunch was favorable for me as I did not recall another male in the restaurant. Then it made me wish that I was really at a club. I sat at the sushi bar to keep my focus on fish, which was airing on the flat screen behind the sushi bar.

We tried to order for an hour later and he said it&#39;s best to call about 20 minutes before, so she did but they got busy in the meantime and the pickup time changed.  That&#39;s completely understandable, but my wife nicely questioned it because he advised to call back.  During her normal conversation the guy turned into an asshole and was yelling at my wife.  Really?  That&#39;s how you want to treat a customer??  Do you really think we want you to make food I&#39;m going to eat after you get pissed about a small question?  He made my wife cry because of how he treated her.  I own a small business myself and this would never happen.  Customer service is 100% of the reason why businesses stay successful.  Even when the customer is wrong you try to make it right or work with the customer to come to a resolution.  My wife was not unrealistic, all she did was ask why and for some reason he snapped.

joes-pizza-schaumburg,Michelle F.,QR8XFFHYU-X0epXOrDbrXw,8IcEXBImpRlWXz9MdThXow,"Thanks to Yelp, I found out this place existed.  After a quick phone call, I realized I was well within their delivery area.  Score for me!!

I ordered my food at 5 pm on a Friday.  The man on the phone was super helpful and nice, and there was some confusion about one of the dishes I ordered--Alfredo Parmigania.  We tried to clear it up, and since I was paying with cash, I asked my total (so I could have everything ready for the delivery driver).  He said he would add it up and call me back.  He never did :(  I called him back and found out the total, but I was hoping not to have to do that.

The Great:
**The chicken wings--FREE w/ the coupon of $25+ order.  Not the &#34;triditional&#34; wings.  They were crispy like fried chicken and had BBQ sauce almost drizzed over them.  Sounds strange, but they were really good!!
**The X-tra thin crust pizza.  Really good sauce, great cheese, not too greasy, and it was pretty big for a &#34;small&#34;.  I really enjoyed this, and I am usually not a thin-crust kind of a gal!
**Friendly Service
**Prices aren&#39;t too bad at all!

The Not-So-Great:
**The cinnamon sugar bites--Good in theory, and the ones that were actually covered in the cinnamon sugar were good, but 80% of them were completely naked, and therefore didn&#39;t taste like anything
**The pan pizza was just meh.  It had grease sogging through the bottom of the box when I received it.  WAY too greasy for me.
**The Alfredo Parmigania (which we had confusion about while I was ordering it) was described as: &#34;A creamy spin on the much-loved classic.our Chicken Alfredo Parmigania combines the best of both worlds&#34;.  So I don&#39;t know if they just got it wrong, but I received grilled chicken on a bed of alfredo sauce over fettucini.  I guess I was expecting something different.  Maybe that was my bad??  But in any case, I didn&#39;t really care for the alfredo sauce at all.  It was really bland.

Something I did appreciate was that they called me after the delivery time was over an hour and explained that they were slammed and on their way.  It was nice that they did that because I was wondering where in the world my food was!

I would definitely recommend and order from them again!  I can&#39;t wait to try some different items--their menu is really vast!",13/05/13,259,4,3,5,56,6.7163,4.0440000000000005,1.183,23.772999999999996,No,2297

Ordering was ok. It was a little confusing though. Sometimes the guy would repeat what I said (what I ordered, my name, etc.) so that I knew he had it correct, and sometimes he wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;m not sure if that was a bad phone connection or what. But, before letting him go, I just confirmed that the order was right and he did get it right.

Delivery was fast. It took around 20-25 minutes. I don&#39;t live far away. But, i&#39;ve had some other local places take over an hour. So, 20-25 minutes is excellent to me.

The pizza itself was just ok. I tried the extra thin crust because i&#39;m used to the south side Chicago pizza (thin, crispy crust). This crust was quite soft. We were able to kind of roll the pizza slices to break them apart as we took them out of the box. The flavor was ok. I&#39;d have liked more crispy crust and to have the cheese cooked a bit more (it was quite white) personally.

We&#39;ve been here twice; once for dinner and once for breakfast - both times were sadly somewhat disappointing. It&#39;s a shame, the owner is very nice.

It really comes down to the high price tag for flavorless food. Walking in you get super excited because the vibe inside is great. Plating, service, and decor are all exceptional. However, my wife and I were both amazed at the blandness of the food. After our first visit, we thought maybe it was just an off night for the kitchen, but we came back again and left equally disappointed.

In a nutshell, I suggest finding another place where your money can buy you much more developed flavors. Epicure leaves a lot to be desired in this category. It&#39;s certainly not cheap either.

Also, big FYI - the pastry they offer you during breakfast is NOT free! It&#39;s $3.95 and they don&#39;t tell you unless you specifically ask. Can&#39;t imagine the shock later for the table of 8 next to us who all took the waiter up on that fine looking pastry...",21/03/16,122,3,1,1,1,0.8301000000000001,1.8790000000000002,0.8900000000000001,12.231,No,1096
epicure-bistro-barrington,Laura D.,e2_cdCS_598xZhIMJAHQTw,EkH6o0lOBSiTcFQZFdjKOg,"I recently moved up to the McHenry area from Louisiana but hail from a Parisian home. Being quite homesick, I&#39;ve been on the hunt for a good French restaurant and have been disappointed by many of the places I visited. I wouldn&#39;t give up though... my anniversary was coming up and I wanted us to try one more. That&#39;s when I saw Epicure Bistro on Yelp. I didn&#39;t read the reviews but went straight to the menu to see how authentic it was. The menu is really inviting and has a great variety of dishes. We decided to give it a shot.

We visited it today. The parking lot was empty and the tables were vacant but they were still open. It was perfect in my opinion since I don&#39;t like crowded locations. It picked up a little after we arrived but it still kept a nice quiet atmosphere. The tables are nice and spacious, the booths are large and able to seat anyone of any size. The waitress was kind and wonderful. She was on point, she would check on us but not too frequently which was perfect. You know those overly bubbly waiters/waitresses that constantly check on you... yeah, she wasn&#39;t that. She was perfect for the atmosphere. 

We started with drinks. I had their margarita and my boyfriend had the 007. The margarita was by far one of the best ones I have drank in a long time. I am a bit of a margarita nut and taste and compare them wherever I travel to. This one ranks as the top for Illinois and in the top 5 for all the states I&#39;ve been to (which is 27). The 007, also known as The Vesper, is exactly how James Bond describes it in Casino Royale. It&#39;s potent, it&#39;s bold, and it&#39;s refreshing. Definitely a great pairing for the foods we were about to consume. 

The pate is about as authentic as you can get it here. There are many locations that claim they have &#34;pate&#34; but all they hand out is chicken liver paste. The pate here is succulent and comes in the traditional duck form. The assortment of cheeses you can have are so traditionally French it brought me home. The breads taste handmade and have that rustic flavor to them. The French Onion Soup is done the way my mom makes it, with a good layer of oil and the onions cooked to a slight golden color before being put into the broth. The salty/sweet version is Americanized. A traditional Onion Soup is usually oily and savory. In France they use it as a natural cleanser and a way to rid your body of toxins. This reminded me of the ones I grew up with.

My boyfriend went for the Mahi Mahi and I had the Pork Chop. The risotto he had was cooked to perfection and paired perfectly with the sauce. The pork, apple, and sauce on my plate were so good by themselves... but magical when eaten all together. The portions were actually decent for the price too. My pork chop was a hearty portion that I had to bring some home with me. My boyfriend cleaned his plate. 

For dessert we had the Bisou, the crepe with lemon curd and meringue. It tasted fresh and clean. The crepe was well executed and reminded me of the ones my mom would make for our New Year&#39;s tradition. A perfect way to end our night. 

All in all, I was impressed. This is the one place that is getting thumbs up from me! I definitely plan on returning. Most likely during the middle of the week right around rush hour as to avoid the crowds. The only problem I had was the music selection... I would have preferred classic French alternative but they have live music on the weekends.",20/01/16,360,5,3,5,95,11.2032,6.88,0.624,40.496,No,3467

The hostess is an extremely charming young lady and our waiter was very attentive.  We had French onion soup and a chilled mango soup concoction.

Just a few things that could&#39;ve made the experience perfect - bread could be warm, leak sauce in crepe could&#39;ve been creamier, and frites seemed a little breaded (kind of like BK).

epicure-bistro-barrington,Gail G.,OopzxlqkzYuSTAPHBeN7sw,GR2u132yZO7T5xIITVreVA,"My husband and I went here for dinner last night and were sorely disappointed!! First of all, this is NOT a bistro...it&#39;s a creperie!! The vast majority of the menu is crepes and sandwiches...no true entrees! A true French bistro would offer things like steak frites and roast chicken....French comfort foods. The only entrees offered (other than crepes) are on a daily specials menu that the waiter gives you when you sit down. The specials are WAY overpriced...seriously, $36 for an 8 oz filet?? $34 for a lamb shank? They also offered a &#34;cassoulet&#34; (again, overpriced), but stated that it was in a marinara sauce??? I&#39;m sorry, but cassoulet does not have a marinara sauce. That&#39;s Italian NOT French.

We decided instead to get a couple of appetizers and try the crepes. The charcuterie plate had two pates and two cheeses along with some grapes, cornichons, and olives. It was served with a couple pieces of toasted bread. The duck pate was decent, but the lamb pate had a funky flavor that was very off-putting. The cheeses were excellent, especially the petit basque. 

We also got the crab cakes, which were tasty, but a small portion for the $14 they charge. 

I ordered the Cajun crepe and  my husband got the Normandie, which had beef tips in a gravy. His was delicious, mine was ok...not really a Cajun sauce. The shrimp were small and didn&#39;t taste fresh and the &#34;wild&#34; mushrooms were nothing but sautÌ©ed button mushrooms. The Andouille sausage in the crepe was very tasty, however. 
The highlight of our meal were the French fries! They were crispy and delicious! They came with a side of ketchup. When I asked the waitress for a side of aioli instead to dip my fries, she had no idea what I was talking about. Disappointing. 

The sandwiches looked good and some tables next to us had ordered them. But my husband and I had come here for a nice bistro dinner and that was lacking. I would recommend this place for a nice lunch, but was sadly disappointed about the lack of dinner options and the overpriced entrees!",10/06/15,241,2,2,2,35,1.8898999999999997,2.5700000000000003,1.9969999999999999,23.433000000000003,No,2060

The charm of their former restaurant in Woodstock is non-existent and the sophistication and well-versed servers of the former Barrington Bistro is absent.

A separate sheet with daily specials was provided but it was not referred to by the server and she did not appear to have knowledge about the menu. Clearly, untrained.

DÌ©cor: This is a nice little spot in a strip mall (don&#39;t let that dissuade you) that has a handful of tables and is very inviting and friendly. There is plenty of natural light from the windows up front and, even when crowded, it isn&#39;t very noisey or too &#34;hustle and bustle.&#34; It&#39;s a very relaxed, laid-back spot. 
Bathroom: unknown

Staff: When we arrived there was a bit of a line waiting for tables. However, somehow, we were called about 2mins after putting our name in! it was great! So thumbs-up to the counter staff. And our waitress was on point with everything we needed. Great staff.

Food: We had a variety of items including eggs+pancakes (delicious and fresh, the pancakes were outstanding as well), Eggs Benedict Florentine (very good), and the &#39;Nawlin&#39;s Eggs Benedict (which is my new FAVORITE breakfast item - it is absolutely OUTSTANDING!) with a side of bacon (rather thick cut and TASTY!). Everything was a generous-sized serving and came to the table hot and fresh.

Value: Given the level of service and the quality/amount of food this place is well worth the prices (which are not very steep at all).

In/around the northwest burbs this is my new FAVORITE breakfast spot. I am salivating just writing this review and cannot wait to return for another meal!",27/01/16,164,5,3,5,59,5.7527,3.4949999999999997,0.23,12.274999999999999,No,1406

We upgraded to gluten-free pancakes and ordered a short stack of pancakes too - which ended up being way too much food, and came with a hefty price tag. I think $2 to upgrade to gluten free pancakes is a little steep, and $5 for a side of pancakes (granted they were ginormous) was a lot as well.

The staff is friendly. The hostess graciously over-stated the wait time so we were happy at getting seating sooner. The portions are big, but not bigger than they should be for the prices. 

The food itself is fairly average. My husband got the N&#39;Awlins Benny. The potato pancakes were bland and a little burnt on the bottom. The andouille sausage was dry and dull. 

I got the sweat berry French toast. Nothing exceptional: it was three huge slices of French toast topped with berries and way too much sugar. 

The breakfast potatoes were good - just the right amount of salt and crispness. All of the fruit - from my berries to the side fruit cup - was fresh and very flavorful. The coffee is weak, but we&#39;re used to Intelligentia when we go out for breakfast.

I usually branch out to areas like South Barrington and Schaumburg because Elgin and South Elgin just don&#39;t offer quality food. In spite of this, I decided to give Sweet Berry a try and see what all the hype was about. 

We&#39;ve arrived around 11:45am on New Years Day. There was about a 10 minute wait, but plenty of seating was available for those who were waiting. Not bad at all for a day that&#39;s expected to be busy. 

Once seated, we were offered coffee. At the price of $4.50 for two people, it was surprisingly bland. We didn&#39;t even finish the pitcher. 

In regards to the food, my bf ordered the Caliente Omelet. It was a large dish which included two big pancakes and fruit (or potatoes). I ordered the Caliente Skillet and upgraded my pancakes to the White Chocolate pancakes for an additional $2.25. The omelet and skillet were pretty good, but the chopped onions it included where huge and overpowered the flavor of the dish. I tolerate onions, but when the pieces are this big, I&#39;d rather do without them. The White Chocolate pancakes were delicious, on the other hand. We didn&#39;t finish our meal because it was a lot of food!

We left. I will never go back until she is fired. I can&#39;t wait to tell my entire community, friends from high school, friends from work, family members, and other how rude this women was and how uncomfortable she mad me feel.

sweet-berry-cafe-south-elgin,Keith P.,89MO26irorNN7BPAE4FbxA,wBoOZUI9UksuaNHr9KOYKw,"So once again I found myself at a breakfast place. I can never really get away from them. Sweetberry is a little newer and I&#39;ve passed it several times but never really was all that into it. Finally, my mom went there and said she liked it better than other area joints. So I thought, why not give it a whirl?!

I went with my family and we were quickly seated and greeted. My only complaint was our waitress seemed a little irritable especially early on. I will say though as the meal progresses she became increasingly pleasant and did quite well. 

The coffee was good. I like that they actually brought a carafe out rather than just serve as you go. I like my coffee and it seems other places don&#39;t do as thorough a job as would be best. But I digress. 

I ordered the biscuits and gravy, my litmus test. The portion was very generous. The biscuits were very good. My only complaint was the sausage was basically cut up links. If they had bulk ground sausage it would have been better in my opinion. My dad got some eggnog pancakes which I was skeptical about. They were amazing!! I highly recommend them. As they are most likely seasonal, next Christmas time when you go, get them!!!! My mom got a frittata which while I do not personally care for, was very good. My sisters ordered skillets and they were very satisfactory. My fiancÌ© had the Sweetberry French toast. It was quite possible the best fruit/French toast combo I&#39;ve had at a restaurant. 

Overall: a local place with a fresh facelift and good value and service and food. I would definitely recommend it and would like to go back. Definitely worth a trip!",30/12/14,182,4,2,5,42,7.718899999999999,6.610000000000001,1.008,20.381000000000004,No,1635

Thank you so much for confirming what I already knew about you and your restaurant.  Remember when I said I didn&#39;t want to introduce myself to you because I knew you would pull out all the stops to make sure my meal was perfect?  Remember why I said I didn&#39;t want to do that?  All I ever ask for from a restaurant is consistency and a good meal, not special treatment.  Well, had I introduced myself to you, I never would have had the pleasure of our REAL interaction recently.

While at your restaurant with my wife and kids, my wife ordered the egg white veggie omelette, with bacon added (I know, veggie with bacon, oxymoron stuff).  The waitress remarks &#34;harvest omelette&#34;.  Knowing that there was another omelette similar, I made sure that she knew that it was the EGG WHITE veggie omelette.  Low and behold, what comes out.  Regular omelette.  Oh, with some sausage sprinkled in.  That&#39;s when the fun started.  When we informed the waitress of the problem, we got attitude, which led to the best part of my meal, my wife&#39;s interaction with you.  The two quotes that will resound in my head and be the lasting impression of you are these:

&#34;We have two omelettes that are similar.  One is the Harvest, and one is the egg white harvest.  You must have ordered the wrong thing.&#34;

1.  I corrected the waitress to ensure that the egg white omelette was ordered.  
2.  How dare you claim that the customer is at fault, when you had no clue what was taking place.  You are in the customer service business.  You do not go on the attack to a customer.

&#34;I&#39;m not sure what the problem is, there was only one piece of sausage in the omelette&#34;

Not sure what the problem is?  How about the fact that she didn&#39;t ask for sausage in her omelette!  I saw the omelette.  It wasn&#39;t one piece, there was enough to send it back and have a new omelette made.  Oh and we love how you guys just took the old omelette back, picked out the sausage and gave us the original omelette, which now resembled a scramble.

I would like to thank you once again for showing us your true colors.  I would like to thank you for showing us just how much customer service means to you.  I would like to thank you for showing us how much our business means to you.  But most of all, I would like to thank you for pissing my wife off, so I don&#39;t ever have to step foot in your business again.

Service was ok. We were never asked how our food was. While not rude, they were not friendly either.

sweet-berry-cafe-south-elgin,Dan S.,81fr37MM4GR62S2yvOt3gA,d7x2pvVNppD-c4AZWqs7ng,"Another 4.75 star rating but I simply can&#39;t give it a 5 star.   That&#39;s perfection &amp; while we both enjoyed the place, it wasn&#39;t quite perfect to me. 

We came here as a last minute decision for Easter breakfast, based on some reviews from friends, Yelp &amp; it was a nice drive away on a beautiful day.  

This place is in the middle of a strip mall  &amp; much larger than I had anticipated.  They have 2 very big rooms with at least 30-40 tables.  The place is very clean with darker wood accents with off-yellowish walls.  We arrived around 11:30.  We were greeted quickly  &amp; happily by the hostess and sat immediately at a booth.  Within 2 minutes, our waitress had asked us for drinks.  Kell had a coffee and OJ.  I went with a Diet Coke.  Kelly said the coffee &amp; OJ were both very good.  I&#39;m a fountain pop snob.  The DC was pretty good, but could&#39;ve used a bit more carbonation.  

Kell &amp; I poured over the big menu for at least 10 minutes....and we were only looking at the breakfast items!  We didn&#39;t even consider anything lunchy.  There were simply a TON of new, creative, tasty options that we had trouble narrowing down our decision.  We literally had our waitress come by twice before we ordered.   I opted for the Cafe French Toast (banana bread french toast with sliced strawberries, bananas, powdered sugar &amp; creme anglaise).  Kelly was torn between the &#34;portobenny&#34; and the crab frittata. When the waitress walked up, Kelly  asked her which was better.  The waitress said the portobenny, so that&#39;s what she had, essentially eggs benedict served in portabello mushroom caps. 

The wait for our food wasn&#39;t too bad, maybe 10-15 minutes.  

The cafe french toast was VERY good and nearly too sweet.  There were 4 thin slices of banana bread, with sliced strawberries &amp; bananas throughout the whole plate &amp; some creme anglaise on top.  It really didn&#39;t need syrup, but I put it on there anyway since I&#34;m a traditionalist &amp; it&#39;s french toast.   The fruit was all very fresh, clean cut and tasty.  I would&#39;ve been happy just eating the fruit.  As far as the french toast itself, I would&#39;ve preferred to have 2-3 slices of much thicker banana bread vs the 4 thin slices they provided so that it&#39;s outstanding flavor would stand out a bit more.  I quickly inhaled my breakfast &amp; was hungry for more.  Even the waitress commented that I ate that really fast.  

Kelly had the portobenny with breakfast potatoes (cubed potatoes, nearly o&#39;brien style).  She LOVED it all!  Said the eggs were poached perfectly, the mushroom caps complimented it nicely and the hollandaise sauce was outstanding.  As far as the potatoes, those were excellent as well.  

Service on the whole was outstanding.  No issues at all &amp; our waitress was pleasant, knowledgeable, patient &amp;  kept the Diet Coke glass full throughout the meal.  

Kelly, a tough critic, gives this place a 10 out of 10, which NEVER happens and we&#39;ve  eaten out alot.  As I said above, I can&#39;t say this was perfect but was awfully close.  Some VERY MINOR deductions for the pop mix &amp; the thin french toast.  Regardless, we look forward to coming back again &amp; again to try all the other options we didn&#39;t go with this time!",05/04/15,366,4,2,5,46,9.524700000000001,5.941000000000001,1.405,32.65599999999999,No,3314

The have a good-sized menu along with their specials menu.

I am so happy we picked this spot and definitely will be back! Our group of 5 came in around 9:30am and there was just a short wait. The host/hostess were very polite and I think it was the owner who took us to our booth asking if it was big enough or if we wanted to wait for something else (it was perfectly fine). 

I ordered the gruyere florentine omelette (spinach and bacon in it) and subbed egg whites. This thing was MASSIVE. I only ate half of it and brought the other half home. It is served with breakfast potatoes which were awesome with a little bit of hot sauce. I also ordered a side of thick cut maple bacon and it was awesome!!

I asked the waitress about it so she checked with the kitchen. They said they put in plenty, but we; (waitress and I) found none. The kitchen said they would remake it, but this time I asked for a short stack. The bill reflected a dollar off for the one less pancake but up charged  $1.25 for extra chocolate chips. Some bullshit. We left and went about our day. After running a few errands, we went home because my wife wasn&#39;t feeling well. She ended up vomiting as soon as we got home. We last ate at 6pm the night before and neither of us drink alcohol. After cleaning up, we called to speak to the manager. She tried saying that we could have been drinking, or ate something else somewhere else. She made several excuses rather than offer an apology, and hung up on my wife who was actually being very pleasant in spite of the mangers attitude.

sweet-berry-cafe-south-elgin,Tony D.,qgyFHzN1ha2tVWAFFG0CeQ,aDNUAYkVi0b7fGNBXH6CRg,"I went to this modern American restaurant on a Saturday at 10am.  I had met some friends from Elgin out and we were able to catch up over a nice breakfast.  We did have a 20 min wait or so for a table.  This was a typical strip mall place.  

The Good
To start the place was slammed.  So while this can be a pain, it is always a good sign.  
The sugar is on the table in a whole jar, the cream is bough out in little cups.  They also have flavor creamer and sugar substitute in small packages on the table.  The coffee is served in its own pot that is left at the table.  So great coffee setup!
The staff was pleasant, attractive, and attentive.  
The food took a reasonable amount of time to prepare, and was delivered hot and did not appear to be waiting under a heat lamp. Everything but the biscuits seemed to be made fresh.  
The sausage pattis were very tasty.  
I tasted my friends banana french toast, and it was delicious.

The Bad
The biscuits from the biscuits and gravy were not very good at all. This was surprising because the pancakes and french toast were very good.  It seems that I may have gotten the last of some old biscuits not sure but defiantly did not seem fresh.  
The parking in the lot was tight, and I had to park way over at the other end by some school.  All in the same strip mall though.  

Overall the food was good, and if I am in the area I will stop back and try something different.",10/05/15,149,4,2,4,22,3.3517,3.141,0.82,17.038,No,1420

I am a city girl who appreciates a good diner, homemade food, healthy options, and a creative menu.  Sweet Berry has all of that.  And great service.  If you are even wondering if this place is for you, check out their menu.  I had the caliente skillet and added spinach.  My eggs were cooked perfectly, potatoes well done like I asked (and not burned), and the spinach was fresh and whole leaves.  They serve it with 2 different homemade salsas.  The food came out really fast too, so this is perfect for a breakfast joint.  I&#39;m doing work on my computer though and feel comfortable sticking around.  They also put the pot of coffee on your table which is nice.  I went for the side of gluten-free pancakes because I don&#39;t see this many gluten-free options very often!  They were amazing.  The pancakes are the size of your head, you get 2 included with your breakfast skillet, and the gluten-free version is smooth and reminiscent of any great pancake batter.

There was a huge center piece on the table with salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, 2 different types of hot sauce, and sweetners so there wasn&#39;t much room for the hostess to set down our 4 page menu. The server was polite, but made no effort to be friendly. He took our drink order and came back shortly with the drinks and asked if we were ready. Like I said, 4 page menu with a lot of items crammed on each page is hard to go through. We asked for more time and what felt like 5 minutes went by before we were asked if we we&#39;re ready again. We decided on the omelets with potatoes.  
Servings are huge. Definitely the biggest 4 egg omelet I&#39;ve ever seen. The ham was delicious. I will blame myself for making our own, they were completely flavorless. The turkey I had misread, was actually turkey sausage which I hate. The sausage is a cut up sausage link, a very sweet maple kind of slimy. The cheese looked like a piece of lunch cheese melted in the microwave...not something I would order again.

The potato&#39;s are unseasoned and very dry. They taste like baked fries, not a good breakfast potato. My youngest some loved them. Both of my boys said the pancakes were good. Tasted just like IHop, I tasted them, they were probably the best thing that we got. Actually very good pancakes.

This is not a place we plan on visiting again. I&#39;m guessing they do much better with the sweet offerings then the hearty.

We ordered a deluxe (I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called) and it&#39;s a real winner, lots of onions (just the way I like it), not overbearing with the sausage (another plus for me) and the sauce wasn&#39;t overloaded with spices making for a tasty, but not acid reflux inducing dinner. The kids had a half pepperoni/cheese pizza and they seemed to enjoy it as well, but the pepperoni was too much for me (see acid reflux comment above). The thin crust was nice and crispy as well, top marks on the food.

The decor is a throw back to all the old pizza joints from the 70s-80s, and all the wooden furniture/trim gave the place an off smell. I&#39;m not real picky about ambiance and I can be very forgiving of a place if the food is good. One negative point is that the place was pretty hot and there was no AC, either it was on the frits or they don&#39;t have one and we just happened to try it on a hot day so no bueno. The biggest complaint, though, was that the server, although friendly and attentive, he was a contributing factor to the odor in the place.

The red wine gravy was luxurious.  The mashed potatoes were perfectly seasoned and slightly lumpy, which I loved!  The red cabbage had a delightful zing to it.

I like Al&#39;s.  The location has a nostalgic feel with wood floors that go CLUNK CLUNK when you walk on them, and the booths are made from old church pews.

It is loud in here; there was a lot of commotion behind the bar area, if they were using a blender it sounded a lot more like a belt sander.

The malts are to die for though.  I had a chocolate malt with marshmallow, which was whipped together.  The smaller malt is the perfect size, as the richness of the chocolate got sickeningly sweet during the last bite.  My mom had a caramel sundae which also looked really good.

I had never been to the Elgin location, but do remember going to another location in my childhood. This location is just lovely, it feels warm and welcoming, and like a place that people love to come and sit and talk for hours.

We ordered several items off the menu- spinach artichoke dip, Reuben, black &amp; blue salmon, and of course a milkshake. We enjoyed all of our dishes, and my husband was particularly happy with his salmon. My Reuben was delicious, and I love the milkshakes (which do not actually have milk now that I think about it) so much at Al&#39;s. The only negative would be that the service was a bit slow as far as pace of food coming out- but we were there for a relaxing meal so it did not matter to us at all.

The soups, salads, steaks, schnitzel and side dishes are outstanding. When you go for dinner, not only do you get a great entrÌ©e (steak, pork, salmon, etc.), but you also get fresh baked bread, soup or salad, and season vegetables.  The dinner menu is pricier than the lunch menu, but I feel that the entrees are still a great bargain compared to other restaurants in the area at the same price point. You will not leave hungry.

Here are my personal favorites:
CafÌ© Salad - Al&#39;s house salad is enormous and comes with homemade dressing(buttermilk and honey blue chees are great). 
Steak - I&#39;ve tried almost all of the options, and they have all been great and cooked to perfection.

The first time we came, our waitress was Gosia, and she was amazing.  She guided us toward her favorite things on the menu and was SO attentive throughout the meal.  We liked the food and Gosia so much that we returned a week later hoping she was working--alas, she was not!  Our server was really nice and attentive, though.  I am just keeping my fingers crossed that Gosia is working next time!

I am also not ashamed to admit that we were back once throughout the week, but for takeout.  Don&#39;t you judge me!!

The whole place is really cozy and has a &#34;homey&#34; feel.  We sat downstairs the first time, and upstairs the second--by the bay window, so it was GORGEOUS.  What a view!!

But anyway, my kids ordered the chicken nuggets meal--it comes with a HEARTY portion of chicken nuggets and fries.  The kids really loved them!

I had the minty spiked martini--SO amazing.  It goes down so smoothly...maybe a little TOO smoothly ;)

I also had the split pea soup with ham (special on Saturdays).  Let me say.  I megaloathe peas, but this was AWESOME!  It was so different and tasted amazing!

My husband had the grownup grilled cheese sandwich and thought it was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches he&#39;s ever had.  This is high praise for him because he loves those little suckers!

I had a bacon burger with fries and it was REALLY good.  I also ordered a side salad, and their ranch dressing is to die for!  Not from a bottle, nosiree!!

When we ordered dessert (of COURSE we got dessert, duh!) it was reminiscent of my childhood!  I recreated a dish that my family used to have in Missouri when we visited my grandmother.  It&#39;s chocolate ice cream, marshmallow topping and malt on the side.  Yeah, it sounds strange but it&#39;s delicious!

I was born, raised and still live in Elgin so i feel like I&#39;m qualified to say that this is one of the few (lasting) gems in the Elgin area. The place is adorable, the service is great and I love the food. Plus, during warmer weather you can sit on the outdoor patio, which I always enjoy. I&#39;ve never had a &#39;serious&#39; meal there... I mostly go when I want a casual (but yummy) bite to eat. My favorite is the salmon Caesar salad (it&#39;s huge and I always have leftovers!). I&#39;m also obsessed with their ranch dressing -- I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s made in-house but it tastes like it is and it is the best ranch I&#39;ve EVER had.

Also, their malts are to die for. It&#39;s what they are known for and if you don&#39;t get one, you&#39;re missing out on the true Al&#39;s experience.",16/01/14,96,5,2,5,47,4.0586,2.4680000000000004,0.527,6.006000000000001,No,836

Sat down and was surprised by the menu as i was expecting standard deli items but got much more. This was during their Octoberfest so i ended up getting their Gypsy Schnitzel.

Decided to check it out based on Yelp reviews because I love new places. Unfortunately my ornery father isn&#39;t the best person to take on dining adventures, although he conceded that his burger was delicious. 

Said ornery father is also in a wheelchair and although there is a ramp to get into the restaurant, the restaurant itself is really not equipped at all for wheelchair access--both in the dining area and in the restrooms (I&#39;m told). The owner?/hostess?/HBIC? did her best to create adequate space so that we could be seated, and was really nice about it, but it felt like a huge inconvenience/ordeal.  Sort of a bummer that in order to give my Dad a break from nursing home hell, I have to go to some gross chain restaurant with sub-par food. 

I should have researched further than a &#34;yes&#34; to &#34;wheelchair accessible&#34; on here so that I didn&#39;t have to make my father uncomfortable and myself a bit grumpy on his bday, but this is still somewhat new for us. Made me feel bad for all those who have to deal with this all the time.

But despite the circumstances, good food and quaint restaurant.",14/02/13,124,3,1,1,-19,0.2973000000000003,1.257,1.028,7.715,No,1204

We happened to be there on a day with PERFECT weather, so we opted to eat on the patio. We got a couple sandwiches, a bruschetta burger and a tuna sandwich... and they were both excellent. We were a little wary of the high prices on the entrees, but judging by the quality of the ingredients in our sandwiches, the cost is probably justified.

We saw someone else get a shake and Sarah remembered that a former coworker also worked at Al&#39;s and raved about the shakes... so we split a 12 ounce shake with marshmallow topping and added bananas. It was amazing and plenty big enough for us to split.

We also got drinks: some beer and some sangria.  Food was decent...I feel like the specialty food (Mardi Gras specials this month) was great but the regular everyday food was just ok.  The burgers weren&#39;t anything different than you could make at home as there was nothing special to top them off.  The bleu cheese was good, but there was nothing else to make it memorable, which is really what I am searching for.  The specials were pretty decent, but they were nothing AMAZING and were pretty pricey.  Service was good, a little slow, but good.  Beer selection is pretty crappy but the sangria was awesome.
