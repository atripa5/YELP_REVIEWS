Time of my visit: Lunch

Let me start by saying, this was not my first time here...  I remembered why it took me this long to come back...  It might be awhile before I come back again...

I always liked little moms &amp; pops type places.  My first test is always to try the gyro.  I ordered gyro, fries and a drink.  Total came under $8 with tax, I thought that was reasonable.  My first reaction was to reach for my AMEX, oops they didn&#39;t take it.  That was a strike one!  Look, I get it, it&#39;s expensive to take that card, but either take them all or be a cash only.  They were busy, so it took them a few minutes to get to me.  I asked my order to be for here and instead I get it to go, at least they apologized.  Normally, it would not be a big deal, but I have yet to get my order correctly at this place (usually I get no onions on my gyro, since I have to go back to work, so either screw no onions up or something like for here or to go).

On to the food, the fries were average and nothing special.  Gyro meat was a bit dry and average.  I have had better gyros.

Honestly, I am not sure when I&#39;ll come back again, but I will try something else and some point, I just need to remember not to reach for my AMEX.  Overall C-."

It&#39;s a little hole in the wall, with a small dining area. I&#39;ve been going here for about 10 years. It&#39;s family owned, and the staff is very friendly. 

They offer just about everything you would expect from a good hot dog joint, and I&#39;ve never had anything bad off their menu. 

Their steak sandwich is killer, the burgers are good, they also have really, really good gyros. They also offer tacos, burritos, and that have menudo on the weekends. 

The prices are great too. Another reason I keep going back. Not like Scooby&#39;s down the road, who have a two hot dog special for $9.99....."

Not sure why he wrapped up everything in a bag to-go, I was dining in. Tried to unfold the mess that was the dog. Onion rings are generic and he tried to charge me a $1 for a cup of water. I paid $7.81 for a very disappointing meal. I think they may appeal to a different style customer. At least I can remove them from my bookmarks. No warm fuzzy feeling from the staff."

I got a cheeseburger and fries with a horchata. Because I could. It set me back $6.72, which is nothing short of amazing if you keep track of beef prices like I do.

The burger was pretty good. It&#39;s hard for me to describe a run-of-the-mill, hole-in-the-wall burger without using more hyphens, so I&#39;ll just say that it was a good burger. Fresh lettuce and nice, melty cheese.

The fries tasted slightly off. I can&#39;t tell you how, because my wife didn&#39;t think they tasted off, but to me I thought maybe some of the flavors from other fried foods leaked into the oil.

The horchata was very, very good, cold, cinnamon-y and exactly what I was looking for.

Overall though, it&#39;s pretty difficult to beat Diana&#39;s - which, by the way, appears to be run by a Hispanic dude, and I wasn&#39;t sure if red hots were actually on the menu - at this price point. I&#39;d come back."

This place has a really weird menu but I am seeing more of this. They have Mexican, American and a little Greek selection. I have tried a few and am a fan.

The service is super friendly. The food is always perfect. Everything is cooked to order so there is no cold food or old food!

The hot dogs are their specialty. Typical Vienna dog but they do it all so well. It comes with fries at no extra charge. I have had their gyros, tamales and as I mentioned hot dogs. All were good and I trust that everything else in there menu, which is huge by the way, is going to be just as good.

Looking forward to my next visit."

When you walk in you&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s very hot inside as the cooking equipment is very closely packed into the front. When I went to Diana&#39;s I ordered the hot dog.

The hot dog comes with fries and is a skinless vienna beef dog. The bun was a regular non-poppy seed bun. The pickle was cut thinly but was not quite long enough to get pickle in every bite. It was light on mustard and relish but had a decent amount of onions. The relish included was not the neon green style found at most Chicago style hot dog joints, but wasn&#39;t too sour either. The peppers included weren&#39;t too hot and complimented the dog nicely. The bun wasn&#39;t particularly soft, but it wasn&#39;t hard either.

The fries included were thick, they were fairly cripsy on the outside and had a decent potato filling. They weren&#39;t too salty, but were a bit on the greasy side. 

Overall this was an average at best Chicago style hot dog. The light condiments, regular bun and so so fries included keep it from reaching the three star plateau. Not awful, but I&#39;ve definitely had better."

This place is a dive in and out joint, its small not too cozy but packs a punch in food and flavor. Their gyros are awesome, it is a very generous portion of meat, tomato, onion and &#34;gyro sauce&#34; as they like to refer to it, and if you order the plate (comes with fries and a drink) you&#39;ll definitely be walking away full (make sure to grab some Louisiana hot sauce for them fries mm mm). 

Their hot dogs and cheese steak sandwiches I would recommend next, the hot dogs are classic nothing extraordinary but their sandwiches are, I definitely recommend a try. Finally, their menudo on Saturday and Sunday is extremely tasty. Although sometimes they sell out quickly due to phone in orders, I got their today at 10:09 am (they open at 10 am) and they were already sold out, yeah its that good. 

Anyways, the location and setting can be a little off putting but the food and service is excellent I highly recommend this place if you like good food at a decent price. 

Oh yeah and they also serve good burritos and tacos. Check em out."

The Vegan Buffalo wrap, is absolutely delicious; spice level is perfect.

I&#39;ve been here three times now , my latest visit I accidentally forgot to order something Vegan. I got to my seat outside, unwrapped it and realized I messed up (100% my fault). I walked back up to the counter to reorder something Vegan, the Manager Dan notice I had returned back to cash register, and asked if everything was OK. I told him that i made a mistake and ordered the wrong thing. He re-made my order to the Vegan version, and when I tried to pay for it he wouldn&#39;t allow it, stating &#34;These things happen.&#34;
This level of customer service is exponential, I have never felt this &#34;special&#34; (haha) in a long time. Most places (and Managers) of establishments wouldn&#39;t have taken the time to make sure their customer was adequately taken care of. I will be a frequent reoccurring customer just based on this experience . Side note when they were closing up, I was sitting outside and Dan even brought me a bottle of water because we would not have access to the soda fountain.One of the best dining experiences i&#39;ve ever had in the Suburbs.

I can&#39;t wait to go back, and try some other Vegan options. if you have not checked out this specific location(right next to The Beer Market) you definitely should!"

That&#39;s not a bad thing when you want a vegetarian or at least reasonably healthy option that doesn&#39;t consist of simply adding the words lean or natural to your food options. Protein bar has a wide variety of options and almost everything that  can be made vegan is indicated clearly on the menu.

There are a couple things to watch out for with protein bar, namely that it is crazy expensive for a lunch option Kama only rivaled by options like an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet. If you order their barrito and also get some soup you can expect to be paying around $14. I would consider that not unreasonable downtown, but that&#39;s a lot for Schaumburg.
 
 Where protein bar excels is that the food is not bland. They make curries that are put into some of their foods that have pretty good flavor and/or spice without being an addition of heat,  as opposed to an equivalent of excess ghost peppers."

However you prounounce it (hint: &#34;keen-wah&#34; is correct), there&#39;s plenty of it here!

Although I was wary of Protein Bar at first, it&#39;s become one of my semi-favorite nearby-ish spots to go to if I&#39;m feeling like splurging a little bit on portions of delicious quinoa or a veggie juice.

In the few times I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ve tried:

- Greenberry Juice
- The Sears Sucker smoothie
- Pesto Quinoa Bowl
- Denver Scramble

DRINKS:

Protein Bar&#39;s smoothies are all fruits and proteins (mixed with choice of milk). I asked for some veggies (spinach) and they had no problem putting it in. However, the smoothie was terrible -- way too watery. Not getting one of those again. 

On the other hand, the raw juices are packed with veggies -- the Greenberry juice is amazing. It was so good, that I went back again a couple days later just to get more.

FOOD:

The Denver Scramble was OK. Not that wonderful. It lacked flavor, and was way too simple for what I paid for it. Yet... the pesto bowl was phenomenal! It was so good, in fact, that I found a recipe and ended up making my own at home. (Oops... probably not good for business if I make it at home instead of going out, but thats how much it impressed me!)

The only problem with all of these foods? They&#39;re not filling. You drop $10-20 on some hit or miss food that doesn&#39;t fill you up. Yes, it&#39;s packed with protein; yes, it&#39;s healthy; yes, it&#39;s yummy; but, you might still find yourself going to the Buger King drive-thru afterwards to grab some fries to fill up the empty space in your stomach. Not that I would know, or anything..."

I stopped in for a smoothie for my son, and the guy who took our order was so low energy, I had to lean in and ask him several times to repeat himself, just during the process of placing one simple order. When he asked me questions that pertain to a regular smoothie rather than a child&#39;s smoothie, I clarified 3 times that I wanted to order from the kids menu. Low and behold, he gives me the total for my order, and has rung up an adult smoothie. 

It took two more employees to help straighten out the transaction, quite a long while waiting there without an apology or an acknowledgement at all. I&#39;m hoping this won&#39;t become the norm."

I love their approach to HEALTHY fast food!

They have loads of yummy &amp; very healthy quinoa options and a special &#34;6 mix&#34; that has a super amount of nutritious flavor packed into each meal marked with this.

I have tried both the Chicken Pesto wrap, and the Newport salad, both of which were tasty, and amazingly nutritious!

You won&#39;t find many &#34;empty&#34; calories here! No no no, they are nutrient dense, and GOOD for you!  I love it!

It makes making healthy smart choices easy!

Some choices are a bit spendy, but when you pay for cheapie crap, you get cheapie crap... you want a $1 menu? Yeah it&#39;s going to be filled with horrible processed junk like from other nasty fast food places.  I like knowing the food choices I make here are GOOD for my body, and great healthy choices!

I seriously will be coming back here time &amp; time again, especially for that Newport salad... those apple pieces add a festively yummy &amp; sweet crunch.

Ok. I am craving it now. SO GOOD!

I am so thrilled they brought a Protein Bar to Schaumburg! 

Let&#39;s all start making healthier choices, that don&#39;t sacrifice flavor or nutrients! Feel confident you&#39;re doing your body AND your taste buds good when you come here....

I love everything they are about!

The interior is nice, clean, spacious and tastefully done...

They do wraps, bowls, breakfast, a DELISH Chilli, salads, blended healthy drinks, and more... 

Pop by and give your body the best fighting chance and eat yourself healthy!"

I still remember the first time they invited me (Do I want a protein bar for lunch? Are you all nuts?) but they swore by it - and I realized it&#39;s a restaurant, and my coworkers were not all Mr. Olympia contestants undercover - and tried it out.

Then it opened in Schaumburg, and I was in the area and very excited to try it again. I cook and eat healthy stuff 90% of the time, so I thought this would be a nice way to break up the super-healthy (ha ha) Christmas week.

#1 The menu in-store is different from what is online. I&#39;m picky - and know I&#39;m picky - so I wanted to make this a very quick stop, as someone else was kind enough to drive me there. Studying up on the web version did not help me.
#2 Price / food ratio = huh? You know the jokes about bird food? This was even a joke to me.

Cliffnotes: I am right there with Nicholas S. --- $10 and....where&#39;s my food? Is this a sauce container? That can&#39;t be my actual meal... right?"

Don&#39;t get me wrong - I enjoy a Chipotle burrito as much as the next person, but I have pants to button. Thus, I&#39;m quite thankful for PB&#39;s tasty and healthy eats.

Is it pricey? Yes. The portion sizes are moderate, but the offerings are fresh and the ambiance is straight forward. You won&#39;t find crazy creativity here, in the food or decor...and I&#39;m completely fine with that. Some of my favorite eats at Protein Bar include...

Wrigley Peeled Smoothie - deeeelicious 
Chicken chili quinoa bowl - always go for the avocado and Greek yogurt topper!
Baja salad - flavorful with a substantial kick

I&#39;ve also sampled the &#34;Green Monster&#34; from the small but solid kid&#39;s menu. If that packed quinoa bowl inspires my almost 2 year old to eat fresh spinach and pesto, surely it will appeal to others. Viva el Protein Bar!"

The location is super cute and conveniently located."

Contrary to the name, the cuisine at Protein Bar is not especially meat-centric. Sure, the menu items have insane amounts of protein (the super original bar-rito has a whopping 48 grams of it) but it&#39;s from a combination of chicken, quinoa and beans. I found the &#34;bar-rito&#34; to be pretty tasty -- and very filling -- but the yogurt sauce made it extremely watery and difficult to eat without spilling everywhere. The Baja salad was decent but definitely not worth the money, considering I could make one at home. Or customize the same salad at Chipotle..

Overall, kudos to Protein Bar for bringing healthy back to the suburbs. Next time I&#39;m lazy and looking for a non-fast food option for dinner, I&#39;ll definitely be back."

I definitely was not disappointed.  I&#39;ve been here a few times and I can&#39;t get over ordering the same thing because it is so delicious.  I&#39;ve gotten the vegan quinoa chili three times in a row...maybe I&#39;m just boring...This is one of the best chilis I&#39;ve ever had.  It is very flavorful and I like to add a little sriracha to it to kick up the spice. 

Every time I&#39;ve left the Protein Bar I&#39;ve been satisfyingly full.  On my last adventure here I also ordered the Wrigley Field? smoothie which was awesome-it did have peanut butter in it so you can&#39;t really mess that up!  I was a little dumbfounded when asked all the options for the smoothie so just be prepared to pick different types of protein, milk, and possible &#34;boosts&#34; (boosts cost more $).  

Overall I&#39;ve really enjoyed this and look forward to possibly, someday, ordering something other than the chili."

The buffalo quinoa bowl is really good. It&#39;s life buffalo wings sauce over quinoa. The bowl is kinda small but ill still get it again.

I found it about 6 months ago and was thrilled with their menu. Wasn&#39;t able to get back there for a while until 2 days ago. They changed their menu. And they must have done it a couple times, cuz I was told that they didn&#39;t have some of the new items on the board. I tried the new Korean Bibi Q and it was ok. But nothing like other items I&#39;ve had in the past. I also ordered the kids&#39; chicken &amp; cheese quesadilla. Blech! Disgusting. Talk about processed chicken and (I think) velveeta cheese. The real disappointment was the Hi-5 blended drink. Their menu lists the contents as: Kale, spinach, pineapple, cilantro, blended with ice.

They even sell Kombucha! 
I&#39;ve had quite a few selections from the menu, the quinoa pesto chicken bowl being my favorite afternoon/dinner choice.

The smoothies remind me of Jamba Juice. I ordered the Wrigley Peeled (basically tastes like a chocolate covered banana). It was really good, but pretty pricey for the size (almost $5 for a small). My friend ordered the chili, and it was about $7 for a small bowl - yikes!

That being said, if Jamba Juice and Chipotle ever had a baby, Protein Bar would be it. 

Atmosphere
The atmosphere was very casual and fairly typical to any smaller chain restaurant with plenty of seating and open space. It was fairly slow during my visit so the noise level was reasonable and the staff was very friendly when ordering. The lay out was a tad funky but easy to follow. The menu posted on the wall was very easy to follow and informative as nutrition facts were listed next to each item.

Food
I ordered the Red Line protein shake (Strawberry and banana) which wasn&#39;t the greatest tasting. It actually had little flavor which was disappointing. The pricing is fair with most of the shakes. You&#39;re also offered a free boost to any shake/smoothie. You can even chose the &#34;hangover cure&#34; boost for those considering a place to eat the morning after an adventurous night.

I also ordered the Southwest Salad which, had good flavor but could use more of a zest and kick to it. Pricing on the salads are extremely high compared to the rest of the menu. The salads are served in large portions which helps you come to terms with the price you&#39;re paying for it.

Overall
All in all, this is a great place for health conscious people who need a quick meal. In my mind, I classify Protein Bar as a &#34;health conscious chipotle&#34; and will definitely return to try the other items on the menu."

Stopped in here for the first time after realizing this wasn&#39;t just a healthshake hangout, but actually sold real food as well!  The experience was hit and miss with a little more on the negative.

I ordered an original bar-rito along with a small chicken chili.  The burrito was a fairly big disappointment.  It features a blended mix of quinoa, beans, and chicken wrapped in a decent tortilla.  The chicken was shredded and somewhat absent, what was there was a mess of dry, flavorless meat which was combined with even more flavorless &#34;house made seasoned black beans.&#34;  It seems they were flavored with bean, since they certainly didn&#39;t stand out.

The burrito also contains salsa and cheddar cheese, both of which are lost in the dry and tasteless flavors of the bean, meat, quinoa combination dotted with small invasions of cilantro.  I know they&#39;re trying to capture a healthier market, and I can even get passed the leading flavor of the quinoa (which I actually don&#39;t mind) but for god sakes, you have to at least try to season your food with something, and the burrito has quite a list of healthy options like peppers or lime that could have added some actual flavor to the dish.

On the flip side, the chicken chili was surprisingly good.  It pleasantly packed a little more heat than I was expecting and the dry shredded chicken which had so clearly stuck out in the burrito made a much tastier appearance here dressed in its tomato-bound brethren.  The chili was a little on the sweet side, which I don&#39;t prefer, but overall not a bad combination.  

The only real disappointment with the chili was the small &#34;snack&#34; size which,  already in a smaller-than-average container, also comes half full.  I&#39;m assuming this is to save calories? but it feels more like a cop-out.

If you&#39;re looking for vegan/vegetarian where unfortunately many places already don&#39;t go out of their way to provide a correctly tasty meal, this might not be a terrible option, but compared to everything else around for lunch it definitely comes up short on flavor...

And high on price, almost $15 for a small burrito and a half cup of chili does smack a tiny bit of highway robbery."

Anyway, Protein bar offers healthy options for people concerned about what they put in their bodies. Not only healthy but tasty too. I love the Spinach pesto chicken quinoa bowl.

I was slightly turned off by the negative reviews but decided to give it a shot anyway. I went in three weeks ago for the first time and was instantly greeted by a girl that was sweeping. As I walked up to the counter I was greeted by the cashier and the workers behind the counter. Was I at the right place? 

I went with the Vegan Quinoa Chili and the Comiskey Cocoa shake. Extra points to the cashier for pointing out that the malt powder wasn&#39;t vegan so they customized it for me. 

The chili was slightly bland but the shake was delicious. 

I had a craving for something sweet so I went in two days later at around 11:30AM. It was empty again except for two people in line ahead of me. I guess I beat the lunch rush. Yay! The morning staff was not as welcoming as the evening staff. The cashier acted as if I was bothering him while I placed my order. I asked if they had soy yogurt and he rudely replied no followed by &#34;is that it?&#34; several times while I was still ordering. I don&#39;t know what was that guy&#39;s problem. There was no one behind me in line and they had five employees in the back so it&#39;s not like he had to run back and prepare my meal. 

I might pop in after work again some day  but I won&#39;t ever come back for lunch. There are far more choices in the area to get a quick bite without the sass."

The prices are $6-11 for items. I have been here four times and i have enjoyed salads and quinoa bowls along with their kids menu. 

The good- the wholesome goodness they put into the meals. I love the healthy mixes they have and the location. 

The bad-the kids quesadillas had tomatoes in them-which is not listed on the menu; I think this was a mistake. So of course we had to take them apart and pick out every tomato-DON&#34;t make mistakes with Kids food-okay! The chicken....what chicken. Every time I go there, I barely get 3oz of chicken, where&#39;s the meat! The employees are tired and at time bothered overly tattooed loafs that don&#39;t even keep the dinning area clean. 

Advice, step it up with good customer service and cleanliness, because some of those gorillas from the gym are gonna get roid rage if they can&#39;t find their meat in their meals."

I went to Protein Bar in the city near Roosevelt last week for my first time and ordered the Pier Nut Butter and Jelly smoothie and I loved it. Today I went to this location and ordered the same thing and it had absolutely no flavor to it... I don&#39;t know what they did differently but I&#39;m pretty disappointed.

I&#39;ve been there 4 times.  Before today, my issues lied only with the employees - lethargic/bored, have NO CLUE what they&#39;re doing at the registers, and on one visit their internet was down therefore they couldn&#39;t enter the credit on my app, refused to accomodate or suggest an alternative since it was THEIR issue, so I walked out.  Poor management and poor LOCAL customer service.  I wrote in via the website about my disappointing experience and received an extremely nice email back, taking accountability for the issue and addressing every single point I made (instead of a generic, auto-generated email).

So I decided to give it one last shot.  And it will, indeed, be my last - this time because of the food.  I ordered the pesto spinach bowl, and brought it back to work (2 mins away).  It was not even close to warm, with very, very dry chicken.  There really isn&#39;t any sauce - which is fine - but with dry chicken it was tough to swallow.  The 16oz bowl was about 3/4 full, and it cost about $6 (one of the cheapest things on the menu).

Also disappointed because their breakfast looked delicious, but apparently Schaumburg&#39;s hours changed to opening at 11am so they no longer serve breakfast.  Really no reason for me to go back then.

I would give 5 stars for the corporate customer service, but the location and food deserves a 2 at best."

I&#39;ve been at this location now 2 times. And the first time the guy working the counter knew nothing about the type of protein they put in the drinks (I&#39;m sensitive to dairy) but left with a good shake. I just went for my second time and it was exactly 8:02pm and I was reading the menu and the girl who was working was EXTREMELY rude. And yelled from across the desk saying &#34;um hi were closed...bye&#34; um can you be more rude?! If your closed, LOCK YOUR DOORS. And they close at 8pm so it was a matter of 2 minutes. And I get it, I work in customer service if your business is closed you want to leave but 2 minutes?!

I&#39;m currently hooked on a combination of Pier-Nut Butter &amp; Jelly and the smile of the beautiful brunette with tattoos.  I would definitely visit more often if I worked closer instead of the current wasn&#39;t 10 mile round trip.

I have been able to try a few different menu items at this restaurant and they are all delicious. A couple shout outs go to the Millennium Perk, Chili, and the Spinach and Pesto quinoa bowl. Protein Bar can get a bit expensive so I am unable to dine here to frequently, however, the quantity and quality of what you get is well worth the price in my book. The staff as well as service is exceptional because you do not have to wait for long to receive your order from behind the counter.

The food here is great.  If you do not like quinoa, then really a salad is your only other option.  Lucky for me, I love quinoa.  My favorite burrito is the original burrito. The original burrito does not contain lettuce, which is great for my extremely picky boyfriend. The first time I came here, I got the black bean bowl.  It was not what I expected at all but it was still good.  I&#39;m pretty sure they gave me kidney beans instead of black beans, and overall it tasted very similar to chili. The actual chili on the menu is good too, but only as a side.  You will not be full from just having the chili.  A burrito, on the other hand, is very filling.

Lastly, I have only gotten 1 smoothie from this place because it was the first one I tried, and absolutely loved it.  It is called Pier-nut Butter &amp; Jelly.  So delicious!

Overall, I recommend this place to friends who want to eat a bit healthier. The prices are more than Subway or any average lunch place, but I think it&#39;s totally worth it."

I took my wife here as we were excited to have a &#34;healthy&#34; high protein option in the area (note artificial sweeteners are used; Splenda). While waiting in line, the manager was very rude to a customer whose order was not to their liking. They ended up walking out. Not a good first impression.
As I got to the counter, I explained my gluten allergy and asked if malt could be removed from my order. A worker rudely expressed that he would try his best to remove it. I immediately asked for them to remove my order as I would not gamble with possibly gluten/wheat in my shake.
Both the manager and employee came to me after a brief dialogue I expressed how rude they were, not only to me but the customer prior. Manager walked away.

Great menu of tasty items with all the nutritional data posted on the menu. I&#39;m 47 years old and bit of of a foodie, but after a recent health situation I&#39;m super aware how and what I&#39;m eating. I have been on the lookout for place like Protein Bar for last few months and these guys have it all. Tasty, healthy diverse menu items, excellent service, cool staff, reasonable prices, all served up in an upscale contemporary atmosphere. 

I&#39;m glad to see that they are expending because of the increased convenience of finding healthy fast food. At a societal level, obese unhealthy Americans really need something like this and I think Protein Bar is going to find a huge market. Even those who don&#39;t consider themselves health conscious eaters may become converts ounce they they taste the food and try the smoothies, etc. This food for everyone, not just health freaks. Health freaks like Vegans and the Gluten Free set will like it too though because they mark the menu items that comply with their diets.

Anyway, try this place out its GREAT."

I was really disappointed.  I ordered the quinoa black bean bowl with kale on the side and a smoothie.  The smoothie was good- but small.  They didn&#39;t put the kale on the side but rather put it in the bowl.  No bid deal but the bowl had almost no kale in it and I swear I have never seen black beans look brown?! I&#39;m used to Native Foods in Chicago where the portions are larger and kale is steamed.  It seems to me Protein Bar talks a great game but isn&#39;t really serious about healthy portions and I just felt they are cutting corners

Tons of delicious sounding options. Got the buffalo chicken/quinoa bowl. It was really flavorful. Maybe a touch too much pepper. My mom got some kind of pesto bowl (so good!)

From regular sandwiches to the creative burgers, there is something here for everyone (Except Vegans). They serve huge breakfast platters all day and have great sauces to accompany any meal. Every meal here has a characteristic to it, and the menu is large enough for a good variety but not so large that it seems like there are food items that don&#39;t get enough love.

My favorite things to get are: Charlie Sheen, Red Reuben, and these hot dogs with bacon bits on them."

Eggs were scrambled and EXCELLENT! Sausage was a little spicy which was nice. Cheese was fully melted. 

Only draw back is that the hash browns - tossed into the burrito could have been cooked more - they were not raw, they were done but I like mine with a little crisp so that is on me for not specifying.

I ate at 9AM and it&#39;s now 330PM and I am still plenty full!"

I&#39;d read it was greasy, and with menu items such as The Heart Attack, Doomsday Dogs, The Charlie Sheen and The Ricky Bobby I knew I should stay FAR.AWAY. 

They put gyro meat on burgers. Mac n cheese on buns. Country fried steak and gravy ON TOP OF a beef patty. I mean this place is like THE ULTIMATE hangover food and I just can&#39;t bring myself to eat it when I have to return back to the office and try to function like an adult. 

However, the intern guys at work (bless their hearts) invited me and I decided I&#39;d try a chicken sandwich- Blue Buffalo. I was glad it was grilled, not fried. It was good but it had jalapenos and it was then I&#39;d realized I had made a mistake. Why, you ask? I love jalapenos, but... 

Canned jalapenos? Really? Who are you kidding, Fatt Mustard? Booooo. Boo I say. 

You got some points back with the tots. I&#39;ll be back but only because these interns are good kids and I enjoy an occasional lunch with them.

If nothing else the menu will give you a good laugh- http://www.fattmustard.com/menus/menu.pdf

This isn&#39;t one of those places. We were persuaded by the reviews and the pretty pictures, but when all is said and done, this is just a regular local hot dog joint. They try to put some interesting things on their dogs, and sandwiches, but overall it&#39;s just average stuff you could make at home. Their big claim to fame seems to be the Fat Sauce, which tastes almost exactly like Red Robin&#39;s Campfire Sauce. 

What they do is fine. We ordered a couple of chili dogs that had mac &#39;n cheese on top, with bacon and whatnot. There wasn&#39;t really anything special about them. They tasted fine. They looked fine. They were fine. 

Don&#39;t take this review the wrong way. If I lived in the area and was craving a hot dog, I&#39;d definitely come back. But I wouldn&#39;t make it a destination stop again. In fact, this is going to be a short review because it&#39;s just simple stuff. 

Service was prompt and friendly. Presentation was fine. Taste was fine. 

It&#39;s just not stand up and shout, eat here every week delicious. And that&#39;s okay."

Unless, of course, you are there for the breakfast (which I cannot write about because I have never been there earlier than 11 AM- but they serve breakfast all day!). 

You just need to order any kind of burger they offer, and the Fatt Fries. It&#39;s really what they excel at. They have enough variety and toppings to satisfy anyone&#39;s weird cravings, and the Fatt Sauce you can put on your fries and feel really bad about yourself afterwards, because you know it was like eating 2000 calories all at once (JUST THE FRIES). But damn does it taste good. 

One time, (at band camp) I ordered a salad here. It came out almost as large as the tray itself. This is obnoxiously large, and I think the employees decided if anyone came here and wanted to act all sanctimonious about being &#34;healthy&#34; they would give them an entire head of iceburg lettuce with a ton of toppings to show them another way they can get to 1000 calories while thinking they are being healthy. 

Another time, I had a special- grilled chicken with buffalo sauce, blue cheese crumbles, all on flat bread with fatt fries. Again, this was a winner. I couldn&#39;t even finish 1/3 of my fries. The portions are huge. 

Just as a side note, parking here is kind of busy, so aim for the side parking lot so you don&#39;t hit anyone on your way in or out of the one way channel along the front of the restaurant."

I love a restaurant that puts a twist on things. Now, before eating the breakfast here, I had tried a panini because it was a free lunch thanks to my workplace. Plus, I was new to the area and didn&#39;t know many restaurants in the proximity. The sandwiches are good; Greasy, but good. The fries are in fact fresh cut, but they&#39;re more like fry nuggets because most of them are so small. In my opinion, the lunch food is average at best. 

Back to breakfast: They have an amazing opportunity to make some bomb breakfast food. Considering they open at the crack of dawn and close just after lunch, they need to make desayuno a priority. You can order it all day, with an exception of a few items. Again, their breakfast is simply average. The omelets usually don&#39;t come out fully cooked. I&#39;ve gotten pieces of egg whites that are still gooey-nasty and personally gross me out (haha). I am sorry to say this, but they&#39;re hashbrowns suck. They are completely undercooked and have no flavor what-so-ever. I understand that they are simply potatoes, but throw some spices on those suckers! Even asking for them well-done doesn&#39;t change anything; Trust me, I&#39;ve asked for them EXTRA well done. I would suggest swapping the hash out with tots, if you enjoy crispy tators like myself. 

On a more positive note, they&#39;re country fried steak is to die for. It&#39;s delicious, fresh, and smothered in white country gravy. If you were to get breakfast there, go for the CFS, no questions asked.

In the end, it&#39;s all like I said: Just average. And greasy. With horrible hashbrowns. Do I suggest trying it out? Sure, why not. Would I make it a point of interest if you&#39;re in town? Mehhh, probably not. Though, to each their own, right?"

Sadly, they are not ON Devon, so it&#39;s hard to tell they are even there. Being that a Fastsigns franchise is in their same strip, you would think they would have more signage at the corner of Devon and Tonne (wood dale) to direct people. 

Fries are stupendous. I just wish they weren&#39;t as chopped up as they are; they are kinda hard to eat. But they really are yummy. I&#39;m not much for fries, so for me to say they are good, is a compliment.

Service is great. The staff is fast and accommodating. 

The place is clean. And if u know me, you know I like clean.

A friend of mine who works nearby turned me on to this place, and since then I&#39;ve insisted on bringing several other friends in to try it, and not one of them disliked it.

This place is amazing.  The amount of items is incredible.  The cheeseburgers come with a nice warm bun and they are a very nice size burger.  The serve breakfast everyday at anytime, I love breakfast!  Breakfast for lunch is awesome.

My double bacon cheeseburger was eh, okay. The meat was more bland than anticipated, since they boast about it being their own and being made fresh daily. And the bacon? I was not a fan. Seemed kinda cheap and thin. 

The fries... not sure what all the raving is about, I got mostly tiny little pieces that I had to spear mass quantities of onto a fork just to dip in ketchup... where all the pieces then fell off the fork and into the ketchup. Gave up and tossed them, mostly the whole bag. They were a bit undercooked anyway. You&#39;d think those tiny little pieces would have fried up fast. 

For $10, I can do a 3/4 lb burger at Dino&#39;s in Glendale Heights. And the fries are included. I will say, Fatt Mustard has the best burger in a 5 mile radius of my job. Unfortunately, as most burgers suck around my job, that&#39;s not a huge claim to fame."

Review - Fatt Mustard

Food - My Fav was def the fries!  They are fresh cut fries, lets say it again bc sometimes peps cant tell the difference.  They server FRESH cut fries.  You can tell the difference trust me!  And the fries are good!!  They serve you more than enough too, but on a cold day who doesnt mind putting back a fried greasy potatoe or two.  lol  When you walk into the place the line dividers are jugs of veg oil.  Kinda funny but kinda gross when you think about it...

Other than their fries, its a typical burger and hot dog joint that get creative on a few menu items.  I ordered the Charlie Sheen it was a burger w/ grilled onions, bacon, jalepenos, hot sauce (franks red hot), and american cheese.  Basically it sounds like a heart burn waiting to happen if you are old, out of shape, and married.  lol  Well Im none of those so I ate it w/ a smile on my face.  :)  Decent burger I would have like to see the burger have some thickness but its one of those burgers that are thin and get that nice crisp from the flat top.   

Decor and Service - They have the cheezy hidden sexual sayings, which I always enjoy reading on the walls all over the place.  Besides that it appears to be a husband n wife duo running the joint very nice people and handle the crowds quite well!  It was lunch by myself so nothing that humurous could happen. lol"

the service on the other hand was terrible.

Me looking at menu and trying to decide what I would like when a employee , I wouldn&#39;t say yelled but forcefully asked me if I was ready to order and I responded I am still looking at the menu and she dismissed me quickly to talk with another employee that was sitting at the pick up window on break I guess.

I was ready to place my order and I walked up toward the register and the employee was still chatting with the other employee and I guess she wasn&#39;t ready to take my order until she was finished talking . I placed my order for the &#34; heart attack &#34; burger  and proceeded to pay , after  she took the order she basically threw my receipt and change into my hand and quickly walked away to continue her conversation with the other employee who was on break.

I ordered a soda with my meal and walked over to the pop machine and wanted ice in my cup, 4 cubes fell out and the machine was empty, I kept pressing the ice bar because it makes a loud click to engage the release for the ice at least a half dozen times while both employees are still talking at the pick up window , which is about 2 feet away. It was obvious that the machine was empty and not once did either employee ask or tell me that they would add more ice to the machine.

So I mentioned to her that the ice machine was empty and she never even looked in my direction. I have a voice that can be heard and for her to ignore me was not going to happen. I then in a louder voice said &#34; the ice machine is empty &#34; and I would like some more ice , she replied OK and continued to talk with her other employee. 3 other customer came in while I was there trying to fill my drink. they never added ice , she never mentioned it to anyone else there to fill it so I had my soda with 4 ice cubes and I guess that all you can have there.

I waited another 8 minutes for my food which was quick and she was talking the whole time I sat there and never filled or made an attempt to fill the ice .

it was 1:20 in the afternoon and  I understand the lunch rush but once I asked if I could have more ice I would have thought they would have filled the machine.
 
sorry but this is not a &#34; respect the customer &#34; type of place I guess. if I wanted rude, and dismissive I would have went to Ed Debevics and would have expected it."

Since it first opened many things have been added and improved.  I&#39;ve tried different things on their menu, from Sandwiches, burgers, all the chicken plates, soups, pasta Wed and salads.  Salads have massively improved, I might have to get one next time I&#39;m in. All their food is seasoned and cooked well. I pay to eat here because the food is fresh. Such as their hot dogs FRESH, not store bought processed in some plant! 

I&#39;d rather pay a little more and know it&#39;s fresh than pay for something cheaper and not know when it expired. The quality of good is good. I always get a lot of food for my money, so I always have leftovers.  I&#39;m happy!

The customer service is always spot on! To address the pricing again, you can always get things from the combo list.  Make smarter choices when buying.  I can get many dishes and be right at $7.00. Much healthier meal than going down the street to McDonalds and paying $5-$9 for a value meal loaded with crap. Just sayin!

Imagine an army of french cut french fries (skin on) diving into a bath of boiling peanut oil.  Anybody that knows their fries knows when it&#39;s peanut oil.  Pair these fries with their special house sauce or the hanky panky sauce which tasted of a creamy mustard with a hint of curry.

They take burgers and dogs and give them an upgrade such as the The Big &#34;Opah&#34; Burger which is what happens when a gyro and a burger has a baby.  This was the first thing I tried here and it works

I was also able to bear witness my coworker finishing what they call the &#34;King Kong Challenge&#34; which is the mother of all hot dogs.  I can&#39;t even begin to start describing this monstrosity of a heart attack.

During noon ~ 1pm, you may not find a table, depending on what time you show up.  The staff is really friendly, and I like the décor of the place as well.  The food is spot on authentic.  The hot dogs taste like Chicago style hot dogs, and fries are out standing.  I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re cut fresh in the kitchen or what, but something about these fries are magical.

The inside looks and feels like your local breakfast stop. This is the kind of cafe that already has empty mugs sitting on your table while a waiter walks up with a pot of coffee assuming you want a pour.

I&#39;ve tried multiple menu items and all were satisfying. If you show up for lunch, give the BLT a shot, trust me.

I ordered an omelet for about $10, and was offered a choice of fruit or hash browns on the side. In addition to this, they offered toast or pancakes with my order - a full meal for under $15 (I ordered coffee as well). I ended up packing about 50% of the food.

The food is very well made, the atmosphere is friendly, and in an otherwise drab area, the restaurant is a nice place to stop by."

We tried to get into Wildberry, but after being told it would be 45 minutes, we got on Yelp and looked up breakfast restaurants in the area.  We wound up here.  It&#39;s a total senior hangout.  Quiet, a little run down, but the staff was very friendly, coffee was good and as far as the food goes, it was good.  Best thing for me was the biscuit in the biscuits and gravy I had.  It was really light and fluffy and melted in my mouth, came with diced potatoes.  What kind of disappointed me was that the food was not hot.  It was warm - if that much.  This is a real turn off for me.  Luckily the flavors were there.

Would I return? maybe for those biscuits.  Otherwise, I will keep looking for other options for Wildberry in the area."

This is quite unfortunate because we&#39;ve been there many times since they opened years ago. Generally, the food and service have been very good. But, today, Mother&#39;s Day, we got a better look at how they feel about their customers and it was not pretty. But, if I were rating our server, she would rate very highly. 

The story goes something like this - since it was Mother&#39;s Day, we made reservations ahead of time. Monday, my daughter called and set up a table for us at 11 AM for brunch. When we arrived, they did not have our reservation. There was a long wait, but they did manage to get in after only a short wait.

We ordered right away. Since our whole family was together, we spent time talking and even ran into some friends who were also there. Before we knew it, 40 minutes had gone by. We flagged down our waitress who said she would check on the food. It came right out.

It was pretty obvious that the food had been sitting around for a while. I ordered a club sandwich and fries. The french fries were cold. My daughter ordered an omelet and specifically ordered it with no cheese. When it arrived, we noticed cheese shreds were sprinkled on top. We called over the waitress who apologized and took it back. She said she would rush the order since we&#39;d been waiting for so long already. A minute or two went by and the waitress returned. The manager send her back to tell us that there was no cheese in the omelet. She pointed out the shredded cheese which she acknowledged and took it back again. Another few minutes went by and she returned again - this time the omelet was cut open. The manager sent her back again to show us there was no cheese inside.

In my life I have never experienced a case where a manager puts there employee into such an awkward circumstance and blames their error on their customer. It was clear that there was no cheese inside, there was cheese on top which management refused to acknowledge at all. She said they would remake it and I asked for her to have the manager come by our table. The manager did not acknowledge us and in fact, never came back to our side of the restaurant.

When you check out at Egg&#39;lectic, you pay at the register. The hostess asked how our meal was and I asked her if she really wanted to know? I asked to speak to the manager. She went back to get her, but instead the owner came out. I explained what happened, and she also argued with us about the food. She told the hostess to take 10% off of our bill (my daughter said it should be free). But, I told her that I was not looking for any money off, I just wanted an apology. She was unwilling to admit they did anything wrong.

Restaurants are great places to go to for a meal out. But, half of the meal is the experience. This was not a great experience. I would give them one star if the waitress had not been so professional and had not tried to resolve the situation."

Today my husband and I came in with our children and were pretty disappointed.  Service wasn&#39;t great, I had to tell the waitress we were ready to order. It took kind of a long time for her to initially come around. I will say, it looked as if she were the only waiter dueing the shift, however, maybe 4 table were being waited on and I saw a few times the workers standing around. It even took a while to get our check. I usually order eggs benedict and this time, the egg was over cooked and the hollandaise sauce tasted odd. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be coming back."

Full disclosure: it wasn&#39;t our first choice. We were at Woodfield and tried to go to that other breakfast restaurant that shall not be named but rhymes with smilegary. The wait there was ridiculous. Like, standing room only, but you can&#39;t even stand comfortably. I called Egg&#39;lectic and asked what the wait was, and they said barely 5 minutes, so we bolted. 

I am so glad we decided to come here! My only gripe was that the booth we sat in was a little tight. I&#39;m a pretty tall chick with uber-long legs, so I had some trouble here. I couldn&#39;t cross my legs without banging them on the bottom of the table, and I couldn&#39;t sit without them crossed unless I wanted to be playing ultimate footsie with my mom. Next time, I&#39;ll ask to sit at a table instead of a booth.

Our waitress was the sweetest girl, especially for being as busy as she was. The food was outstanding for the price. My mom and I both ordered the farmhouse, which is biscuits and gravy with two eggs and hash browns. I was expecting one biscuit cut in half, since there was so much more involved in the meal. Nope! It was a full order of B&amp;G (two biscuits), plus a full order of hash browns (like half the plate and overlapping onto the biscuits), and my eggs were poached perfectly! Needless to say, there was plenty to bring home as leftovers. I also had a large fresh-squeezed OJ, which was delightful and didn&#39;t break the bank. For the two of us, the bill came to 19 bucks. Worth every penny!"

Stayed down the street with the family for a few days and ate here twice! I had the same thing both times because it was so good. I ordered the Irish Benny which is corned beef hash on an English muffin topped with egg and hollandaise sauce with a side of hash browns. Seriously good eats. The service is kinda off as we waited awhile before our server came to take our order both times. However we were seated quickly and food came out fast as well.

I tried the California Omelet with hash browns and pancakes instead of toast which was a massive amount of food for breakfast- I was glad we went later in the morning because it lasted me through lunch too. The mix of the swiss, jack and cheddar cheeses with sour cream on the side made a delightful topping.

Parking on a Sunday apparently can be a bit of a problem, but a tip if you can&#39;t find parking is that there is an extension to the parking lot in the BACK of the restaurant building that when we visited was mostly empty.

The only negative- and it is a very small one for me, is that the items we were served weren&#39;t as &#34;picture perfect&#34; and beautifully plated as the more upscale breakfast places in the area. The items we ordered looked largely homestyle ordinary but the TASTE was extraordinary. I am not so picky that my meals have to be art on a plate- I just want something tasty that will stick to my ribs and that certainly is what we got.

I felt the prices were good to slightly inexpensive considering what we got for the money. 

Overall we were very pleased with Egg&#39;clectic Cafe and I feel that it is worth putting on your &#34;to try&#34; list."

I had not been here in a while, so I was hoping the experience would be just as good. 

I&#39;m still impressed with the amount of items to choose from on their menu. I decided to get the special for the day, which was a Mediterranean benedict. I knew right away this was either going to be terrible, or amazing. Had it not been for the home-made hollandaise, it would have been great. Maybe I&#39;m just not a fan of the home-made hollandaise (although I think I have had it before at other places and liked it), but the sauce ruined the taste of everything. Everyone else seemed to like what they got, so I&#39;m thinking this was just not my dish.

The service was a little slow. For not being that busy, we had to ask for refills on coffee and water and had to remind them about a plate of pancakes.

Have yet to find another breakfast joint that gets it just right. I prefer the Florentine over the regular, but I&#39;m a veggie over meat type of gal anyway. Another favorite is the Veggie Skillet, which I usually swap out the cheese for feta instead, though both ways are delish. When it comes to pancakes, it&#39;s easy to disappoint with multigrain batter. Well not here!! Spot on perfection. For lunch, my fav is the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, no bleu cheese, sub their HOMEMADE ranch instead. Which, by the way, is also perfect to pretty much dip and dunk anything in (especially their golden onion chips *drool). Tied for first place (lunch) is also the Pot Roast Sandwich, which also tastes great accompanied by above referenced ranch.

I ordered california omlet (whites only)no cheese, no toast, potatoes nor pancakes. I still got charge for the entire meal plus a dollar extra for the whites! Seriously?

Like you, I searched Yelp for help in selecting a place to enjoy breakfast.  My choice was Wildberry because of the reviews.  It was in a shopping mall and I got what the Yelpers told me: a half hour wait. There was also a wait for the food to get to the table and a relatively good breakfast.  This time we tried Egg&#34;lectric.   This review is for a weekday breakfast at both. Do not assume weekends will be the same. 

We were able to park in their parking lot and received a friendly greeting on the way in and a friendly thank you on the way out. As an aside, when we got to Wildberry the young liberally inked (tattooed) person was too busy chatting with other workers to say hello. Back to Egg&#39;lectric.  It is clean, but the decor has not been touched lately. I intend to eat the food not drink in the beauty of my surrounding at breakfast. I want a relaxing meal. That is what I got. I had Eggs Benedict with a thick slice of ham...not Canadian Bacon.  The eggs were perfect. At Wildberry they were just able to emit a little wet yoke. When my companion asked about the ability to make the Quesadilla with eggs and bacon a wrap she said we will be happy to give it to you.  So what I am attempting to convey is if you want a relaxing week day breakfast, at a reasonable price,  without fighting the crowd and standing for half an hour this is a better choice.     My companion, Tonto agrees."

Problem is, many of said diners/breakfast locales are just ok. And while I don&#39;t need Wildberry every weekend, I often crave their creative dishes. What I do not crave is the asinine wait that forms every.single.weekend. Thus, I&#39;m always on the lookout for tasty substitutes. And overall, Egg&#39;lectic is solid. And technically in Rolling Meadows. 

Inside, Egg&#39;lectic is country kitsch without meaning to be kitsch. Know what I mean? It&#39;s comfortable, spacious and a welcome respite from crowds. The menu is pretty impressive - deep with options that will likely please any picky palate - a multitude of creative omelets, fritattas, oatmeal, pancakes, scramblers, crepes, combos and more. If you&#39;re feeling indecisive, I bet you&#39;ll have a helluva time making your b-fast decision.

I often steer towards the sweet side of a breakfast menu, thus went with the blackberry-banana pancakes. The pancakes were hearty in size and flavor, and the fresh blackberries and bananas made for a tasty combination. Nothing too crazy, just a nice stack of carb with fruit - no fanfare in the presentation. My main issue with the combo breakfast was the eggs that came with the pancakes. The eggs were pretty gummy - akin to those you may scrape out from the bottom of a chafing dish at a hotel buffet. Perhaps they sat under the heat lamp too long?

Regardless, Egg&#39;lectic offers a really deep menu for all you breakfast lovers out there. If you find yourself hangry in Arlington Heights/Rolling Meadow, it&#39;s certainly worth a try!"

It took me 15 minutes to decide- we went at 12 but they serve breakfast all day! 

I ended up getting the cinnamon apple French toast and OMG it was delish! There was a whole lot of food on that plate! It came out piping hot and the heat was warming up the apples from crunchy to soft which made them even sweeter as they melted in your mouth. But every now and then you would get a crunch apple. My mouth is watering as I recall this meal! Most of my colleagues got savory breakfast items and theirs were just as good. Bacon was thick but not too thick. Service was great.

I discovered this location thanks to Yelp (woot!!) and my husband insisted that we go the very next day (which just happened to be New Year&#39;s Eve).

My husband&#39;s FAVORITE breakfast place is Egg&#39;lectic cafe, and his favorite thing to order is the Banana Nut Bread French Toast Combo.  He gets it w/ eggs over hard, and it comes with two slices of toast.  This is his tried and true meal, and he has yet to sway from it! :)

I, however, try something different every time, and I have yet to be disappointed!  I got the healthy scrambler w/ the potatoes and substituted peppers for spinach with no extra charge.  Gotta love it!!

The kids ordered french toast and one of their specials--oatmeal pancakes!  They had oats and raisins in them and were delicious.  The french toast was standard fare--not bad, just nothing to write home about!

As for my scrambler--YUM!!  You never know how these are going to turn out--some are tasteless, some are greasy, but this one was delicious!!  There&#39;s nothing worse than ordering a &#34;healthy&#34; scrambler and have it swimming in grease, but Egg&#39;lectic understands that!  It wasn&#39;t overly-oiled and was still delicious!  The potatoes were a good compliment!

For the four of us, it was $37 including tip, and my husband was even offered a cup of coffee to go.  What a nice touch!!

We will definitely be back!"

Here&#39;s your answer to break-fast without the 2 hour wait (which is also known as brunch... also known as Wildberry wait expectations). At Egg&#39;lectic we got right in. I even saw 3 other couples come into EC while we were dining who I had also seen standing for tables at Wildberry when I went in to check on the wait time. Apparently, this is THE place to go if you get rejected by the insanely popular W-Berry. 

Like any warm-blooded Schaumburg area-n, I love to eat at Wildberry. It&#39;s one of the only reasons I get up before 3pm on the weekends and one  of the main reasons I, sadly, won&#39;t be cutting weight this summer. But sometimes, unfortunate things happen and I can&#39;t always get a table at Wildberry that doesn&#39;t come with a ridiculous wait time, that my morning-mate will not tolerate. It was after one of these occasions that we luckily discovered Egg&#39;lectic Cafe. 

With a HUGE menu and items that, like Wildberry, are a bit more imaginative than your average B-fast menu, I quickly forgot about feeling like a pre-lunch loser who didn&#39;t get on the list. With your pick of flavored coffee creamers (mix the hazelnut and chocolate!) and pages and pages to choose from, Egg&#39;lectic was quickly winning us over. The &#39;Hey Ricky&#39; omelet was packed with avocado- there had to have been at least 6 of those bad boys up in there. And the stuffed french toast was a real panty-creamer. They NEED to sell that passion fruit jam. I hate putting jam on my ish but I was literally eating it straight out of the bowl. My BF tried to stop me because he thought it was gross, then I made him try the jam and he changed his tune. He was then trying to stop me because he wanted to eat it on it&#39;s own, too. SO good. The plates here come a little less dressed up than at Wb, and overall, nothing is as fancy or modern, or even clean, but the food is just as good and you don&#39;t have to wait 2 days to get a seat to eat it. 

We will definitely be back. Next time I&#39;m ordering a bowl of that passion-fruit jam, though. And maybe the Cap&#39;n Crunch French Toast, too!"

They have the absolute best Chicken tortilla soup from here to the Himalayas. I wish they would open a place closer to my office, because I would have lunch here once a week. And lunch would include a vat of their chicken soup and a club sandwich. They have yummy fries and delicious breakfast items. I know this because I drooled at each of them as they passed our table.

I am not much of a breakfast person, so their lunch options appease me. My fiance ordered the cinnamon roll french toast and looooooved it! The only thing I would mention is that their breakfast sausage was just average. I would either order it well done or get bacon instead. Their bacon was pretty decent.

They had a number of items on the menu that I would try but since having had their soup, I think I will stick with lunch. They have crepes which I know everyone loves, waffle, pastries and skillets. Their menu is pretty extensive.

My fiance tossed around the Red Velvet french toast idea that sounded good, but he was more than happy with what he ended up with. My sister opted for lunch as well. She rocked a chicken sandwich with bacon and a side of onion petals. The toast came out all buttered up, and she didn&#39;t want that buttered so she ordered fresh toast plain. Don&#39;t worry though, my guy snatched up that buttered toast and ate almost all of it. Evidently, it was good.

Based on reviews and since Katie&#39;s Kitchen had already closed for the day, this was our next choice.  If you can make it into the dining room even at 2 minutes before closing time, they will still serve you.  Luckily we were one of three tables so we got everything fairly quickly and they didn&#39;t cheap out on anything being that it was already closing time.  Once they took the order and brought out the basics, they let us know how much time we&#39;d be waiting.  Our waitress was kinda aloof, of course it was closing time, but, the runner and the hostess helped us more often then our waitress.

Nice, welcoming atmosphere makes me think of a comfort food environment and reminds me of the typical restaurants found along expressways.  The table tops are red and white checkered which to me reminds of pizza, although that is not served here.  Food was better than average and we could see why this restaurant is highly rated in this area.  Not a decision I would make again though, it was good not great.  Some of the flavors weren&#39;t appealing to us and since both of us got different Eggs Benny&#39;s, we found the hollandaise had an almost sweet taste to it which is a first for the both of us.  The highlight for me would have been the fresh crepe filled with Gnutella and topped with sliced bananas, which again was just okay.  With your brunch entree comes hash browns or house potatoes and fresh fruit.  The meal is filling and you can leave with a food coma.  

This restaurant has its own parking lot and I guess sometimes it can get so busy that there is spill over into the next restaurants adjoining parking lot.  Which you shouldn&#39;t do unless you have money to cover your car towing cost."

Their portions are also out of control! I ordered Juevos Rancheros with a side of pancakes for an additional charge because it was unbeknownst to me how much Juevos Rancheros and Potatos would be on my plate.

My Mother ordered the Old Fashion Oatmeal. It came with milk and brown sugar on the side.

My Aunt showed up when my breakfast arrived; just in time for me to share my order with her. I literally gave her half and it was still too much food for both of us to finish. 

I was shocked to see so many condiments at our booth: ketchup, Tobasco, butter, sugar, cream, A1, salt and pepper. It was hectic digging through the pile of flavored cream for regular half &amp; half. It turned out be convenient to grab the ketchup and Tobasco sauce while the food was still hot.

It was about 5pm on a Saturday , it was pretty dead there. I only saw two other people eating there. 

We were quickly seated and given menus. The service was super friendly,  i loved the bubbly personality our cute little older server had. 

The rolls were quite inexpensive,  but i just wasnt that impressed. They dont give you a miso soup while you wait or anything like they typically do at sushi spots around the area. The rolls were good, but rather small. I dont think ill come back again, ill probably go to nikko further down algonquin."

What I got was a fair level of disappointment.  I ordered the Philadelphia Roll, which was a clumsy mess of low quality salmon and cream cheese, without real consideration for proportion.  The 911 roll showed more promise, but again it just failed to deliver any real finesse.

Sushi should be a thoughtful experience where chefs understand their ingredients and dare the guest to experience excitement in each bite because each element is so exposed.  This, this is what I&#39;d expect to eat after sweating out a 12-hour day in a warehouse.  A Burger King level of two stars for a Burger King quality experience."

We would literally come here once a week to get my favorite dish their tonkatsu curry!! As an Asian that has tried tonkatsu curry at every Japanese restaurant that offers tonkatsu curry, it is by far the best tonkatsu curry I have had in the US. It is super hearty and warming to the soul. Their curry is perfectly flavored with nicely sized chunks of carrots, onion, and beef. The tonkatsu is only 1 deep fried pork cutlet, which may be the only downside because it is so crispy and complements the curry so well. Beneath the tonkatsu and curry is a bed of rice that is well-portioned. 
Their miso soup and house salad are also excellent. The Japanese salad dressing they use is so GOOD! My husband loves futomaki, and the futomaki at Sakura is amazing! Their spicy tuna roll is great and comes with a good amount of tuna. I could go on, and on about all the wonderful dishes they have made for us that we have thoroughly enjoyed (Niku Udon, Menchi Katsu, Zaru Soba, and more!)
As for the service, Sakura is a family-owned restaurant and everyone there is very friendly! The restaurant is located in a non-descript plaza that seems a bit run-down, so try not to be put off by your initial impression. Inside the restaurant is separated into two rooms that you can select to be seated in. One side is where the kitchen, sushi area, and bar is located, this has seating for smaller groups of 2 or 4. This side is where my husband and I usually sit, because it has a more intimate ambiance, and we come during slower hours (8:00-9:00pm on weeknights). The other side is a lot brighter and can accommodate bigger groups, on weeknights you will see a lot of Japanese businessmen gathering in this room eating and drinking pitchers of Sapporo. That&#39;s how you know this place is good. The other side also has a great jazz band that plays on some weekends! If you are looking for an authentic taste of Japanese cuisine, Sakura is the place."

I had been there several times before and never had an extreme experience as the last one, but this one server, not sure if she&#39;s the owner, made the visit so unpleasant I will not go back to this place again.
The old Japanese lady spoke in a very rude manner.  We saw only shrimp tempura in Tempura Udon and asked if it should come with other vegetable tempura as well.  She angrily responded, &#34; No!  That&#39;s Korean style!  This is Japanese style!&#34;  First of all, I did not understand why she was rude in her response.  Second, what does Korean and Japanese style have to do with answering whether or not vegetable tempura should be included in Tempura Udon?  I had suspected that she may be discriminating due to my nationality, but thought perhaps she&#39;s just having a bad day or she&#39;s a grumpy person and that&#39;s how she speaks.  Shortly after, a Japanese family was seated next to our table, and the server&#39;s demeanor changed like a night and day!  She smiled at them, checked on them, and conversed with them asking where they are from and so forth.  The server spoke rudely to us with a straight face, never checked on us and we had to wait and ask for her in order to get the check.  Obviously, she is only one person and cannot represent her people, however, she left such a negative impression with her poor, discriminatory demeanor, it really doesn&#39;t help the image of her restaurant nor her people."

And boy, am I glad it was closed! Sakura is definitely one of my favorite Japanese spots in the Chicagoland area.

Having lived in Japan for 6 months, finding authentic, quality Japanese food can be difficult--so many watered down, Americanized versions out there. Sakura, though, is not one of them. It&#39;s true, Japanese home cookin&#39;. The saba shioyaki is excellent &amp; perfectly seasoned. The sushi tastes fresh, though maybe a tiny bit pricey for the amount. The udon is a good, solid udon, as is their miso soup. I often gauge Japanese restaurants by their miso soup; it&#39;s so simple, and yet at some places it tastes more like salt water. I figure, if restaurants take the time to make a good miso, they probably put in a strong effort into the rest of their food as well.

The service is friendly, and the vibe hospitable. The room is a little on the warm side, especially near the kitchen, but it&#39;s nothing unbearable. If you&#39;re looking for good, authentic Japanese cuisine, Sakura is it."

Appearances can be deceiving, however, as inside features some nice maki choices and a pleasant enough atmosphere.  On the night I went (a Friday), they had a live soft jazz band playing.

Upon entering Sakura you&#39;ll likely be greeted enthusiastically by one of their sushi masters.  Chef Morimoto (no idea what his name actually was) seemed genuinely happy to have our business.  Our server was much less spirited--in fact, she was pretty meek and spoke almost too softly to understand.  What was more of a problem was when I asked about the specials, I received a blank look and no response.

Me: &#34;You know, the daily specials....I think the sign outside said softshell crab?&#34;
Her: &#34;Sure, crab, yes, mhmm.&#34;
Me: &#34;Uh, okay then.....&#34;

So I got two orders of nigiri sushi which was adeptly prepared by said friendly sushi guru.  As he handed it off to my hungry eyes, I politely nodded my head and said in my best Uma-Thurman-in-Kill-Bill voice, &#39;arigato&#39;.  He smiled, appreciating that the whitest dude ever (me) at least made a bilingual effort to thank him for being a master at his craft.

Sakura is one of the few places I&#39;ve been to (can count them on one hand) that has Sapporo beer on draft.  SCHWING!  When it came time to ring up the tab, I received no itemized receipt, as I would get at literally any other restaurant on the planet.  Instead, I just got the final amount and had to request a play-by-play tab so I knew how much my Sapporos were (they were $6 each).  The check total was a bit more than I expected, but you can&#39;t really put a price on carefully prepared sushi.  Or can you.....?


TL;DR: 4 stars for sushi quality, 3 stars for value, 2 for service--average 3 stars.  Plus 1/2 a star for having draft Sapporo, and in rounding up/down Sakura gets the benefit of the doubt.  There&#39;s dozens of other places I&#39;ve been where the sushi maki is the same quality in a greater quantity at half the price."

It&#39;s not a real holiday and I know nobody who isn&#39;t a community manager even cares (though I did get one shout out- thanks, Christian K!), but for whatever reason I felt like celebrating this made up day by treating myself to a solo sushi dinner at a local independent business.

I&#39;d been wanting to check out Sakura ever since I stumbled upon Yanyao N&#39;s review, because, ya know, her word is as good as gold in my household. No joke. If I say I found a place I really want to visit, the peanut gallery at the G household happily ignores me. But if I say Yanyao went somewhere and loves it, well, all of a sudden we&#39;re running out the door to get there. 

So anyway, I head on in to a semi empty Sakura and get to pick my seat from the 2-tops in the first sectioned off room area. I had my pick of seats at the sushi bar but personally, when I go out to eat alone, I like to eat alone as well and not put myself in any kind of position where I might have to talk to people who aren&#39;t directly affiliated with restaurant. 

My server was soft spoken and sweet and brought the miso soup I ordered out in exactly the blink of an eye. The general vibe of the service on a Monday night wasn&#39;t overly attentive or friendly, but I&#39;ve waited tables before and the absolute worst is when it&#39;s slow and you get stuck waiting on a single person, trying to decipher whether they&#39;re just sitting there looking all all blank because they need something or because they just enjoy the silence. So I guess for my being a single diner who was just in it to enjoy the silence, the service was pretty spot on and my green tea was always full and hot. 

The broth in my miso was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had- so much so that I was tempted to follow up my appetizer miso soup with a second serving of miso soup. For sushi, I went with my standard spicy tuna, which was fine, but I tried it after having started with the 911 roll (tuna, jalapeno, double wasabi, and spicy sauce) that was by far and away, the spiciest tuna roll I have ever had--and I always seek out the spiciest thing on the menu and 100% of the time I&#39;m disappointment with the lack of spice... but not this time. It was perfect. Perfect and spicy enough that I had to take a break and chow down of the lobster salad to cool my mouth off, so I could even attempt to taste the spicy tuna roll. LOVE. 

They didn&#39;t have a ton of sushi options, but they have other dishes beyond sushi like noodles, tons of appetizers, salads etc. The atmosphere isn&#39;t fancy, there isn&#39;t much ambiance, but you probably weren&#39;t expecting the Ritz if you paid any attention at all while pulling up to this somewhat dilapidated parking lot and outdated suburban strip mall.

When I went to leave my server stopped everything she was doing to thank me for coming in and I turned the corner to the exiting path past the sushi bar, all the elder sushi chefs stopped what they were doing and took the time to thank me for coming in and trying their food. Then, as I walked out the door, my heart, now warmed by the kind gesture of appreciation by the staff, grew three sizes larger when I saw this sign: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TS__uZpyM-kVJ4GwIa7b0g&amp;userid=UsXqCXRZwSCSw0AT7y1uBg

It&#39;s got the head chef&#39;s photo on it (from his younger days) and handwritten at the top in silver marker and red, glittery puff paint it reads: Thank you very much. See you tomorrow. Have a nice day. 

And that was it. So much heart in so few, short, simple interactions, yet I felt more appreciated than I have in, well, a really long time. And you know what? I probably will be back tomorrow; Showing my support and appreciation for independent businesses like Sakura that truly appreciate their customers."

I tried the miso soup and agree with the recommendations here. It&#39;s simple but really good. We had a few different maki rolls, all of which were great. The spicy sauce on one of them was creamy and delicious. My girlfriend, who usually doesn&#39;t like spicy things, kept dipping her philly roll in it. The waitress recommended a really good sake, which I&#39;m sure was a lot better than the one we almost got (not knowing much about sake). My one complaint is that the green tea mochi we ordered after our meal was a little freezer burned and frozen as hard as a rock, which made it hard to eat. Not enough to bring my review of this place down from 5 stars. The food and service were that good. I wouldn&#39;t make a special trip out to Rolling Meadows just for Sakura, but if I find myself in the area again then you bet I will be back."

I was looking for an old short bald sushi chef to bring me to nirvana. My search for a true shokunin led me to Sakura - one of the oldest Japanese restaurants in the area. 

Surprisingly, the sushi items were quite limited. You have the classics but the stellar items like toro (fatty tuna) and uni (sea urchin) were missing. As a result, I ordered maki and specialty rolls and some a la carte items. The spicy scallop roll was definitely the favorite since it was made from big raw scallops. Often times, spicy scallop rolls are made from smaller cooked pieces since it&#39;s cheaper but this wasn&#39;t the case at Sakura. Several of the maki rolls were only $6-7 for eight pieces which is reasonable. But based on my order, it appeared that the meal was prepared by the apprentices rather than the shokunin. 

After the meal, I didn&#39;t smell the sweet scent of cherry blossoms and left the meal a bit unsatisfied. Maybe their known for other items rather than the Americanized maki roll? I am to blame since I made the gaijin mistake of not sitting at the sushi bar and just allowing for the chef&#39;s choice. The yakuza in me was about to offer a finger as a form of apology but the owner insisted that it wasn&#39;t necessary. I didn&#39;t perform seppuku but will not make the mistake a second time."

My guy is in Chicago on business frequently, and we often stay out in the Schaumburg area. The food has, without exception, been excellent. But we were treated so poorly on Monday, February 4, that we will not return.

We arrived at the restaurant shortly after 7 p.m. The place was not crowded  and we were told we could sit anywhere. We chose a table near the window. 

After we sat down, ordered our food and had begun enjoying our beverages, a large group of Japanese businessmen came in. The staff began racing around, re-arranging tables to accommodate them. A server (not our server, but the one who presumably would be waiting on this group) said she needed our table for that group and she would like us to move. No &#34;please&#34; or &#34;would you mind...?&#34; No assistance in moving our stuff. No offer of any recompense for our inconvenience. Just get thee out of our way.

I probably could have let it slide, but my companion was furious on two counts. First, that we were asked to move, at all. And second, that there was absolutely no courtesy or respect accorded in any of it. We walked out.

My mom and I asked for water and the waiter only brought her one, said he was going to be back with mine and then forgot. 

The food was pretty good, it just seems a little pricier than other sushi places of equal quality. The fish is fresh and the sushi chefs are extremely friendly. 

The miso soup was really good. It has a lot of flavor and is not watery like a lot of other sushi places. I really liked the Mexican Roll... it is mush spicier than the 911 roll. 

I might go back here if someone else suggested it, but it would not be my first choice."

My first Japanese boss took me here back in 1997 and introduced me to sushi...and ever since then, I have been hooked... both on sushi &amp; on Sakura.

However, the prices have gone up, so for the Sakura Chirashi dish (the one that includes Salmon Roe),  you will be dinged for $25.  But, along with the increase of price, it seems that they have increased the quantity of that dish, so I guess it kind of off-sets itself. (It is now 3 hours after we left, and I still feel stuffed.)  The quality of all the fish that I had today was excellent.  Another member of our lunch party had the Ramen (i know, i know...not Japanese), but he said that it was one of the best Ramen dishes he has ever had, and he had spent some time in Japan. 

Which goes to this point:  An establishment that keeps on producing quality Japanese food year after year, and continues to be a favorite of the local Japanese clients (I work for a Japanese owned company, so I have known plenty of expatriates from Japan who love this place), and can pretty much fill up the place for both lunch and dinner, definitely deserves a 5 star.

The strip mall in which the place is located in looks pretty suspect, but don&#39;t let that scare you off...you will forget all about that when you walk through the doors!"

Top 10 reasons for Sakura lovin&#39;:

1) No-frills, strip mall, ethnic - my absolute favorite!

2) Super enthusiastic service - our server was such a doll! Joking about the size of the portions and commending me for my valiant effort at taking down their bento box. Waters filled, empty plates bussed. Superstar!

3) The lunch menu offerings! I had such a difficult time deciding because this menu reads like Yanyao&#39;s favorite Japanese foods - yakisoba, katsu don, unagi don, ramen, udon, zaru soba, spicy scallop roll, tonkatsu, tempura (and sushi/sashimi/maki rolls too). Plus, they have sukiyaki and and shabu shabu for dinner!

4) Over half of the clientele during our visit was speaking Japanese. 

5) The combination bento box! This is the most absurd bento box I have ever encountered - more like a bento platter. I chose unagi over the beef/chicken/salmon. Out came a giant platter with THREE salads (house, potato, and a cucumber with seaweed and crabstick), rice, a huge piece of unagi, two pieces of fried shrimp (so good, I even ate the tail), and vegetable yakisoba (THE BEST) -- yes, you read that right... rice AND noodles. Everything delicious. Very difficult to finish. FOOD OVERLOAD!

6) The tonkatsu is crispy and delicious - 2 large pieces of pork, served with a house salad, rice and miso soup.

7) House-made gyoza - winner!

8) The speed at which lunch comes out - we were eating within 7 minutes of ordering. This is a terrific lunch spot in the area.

9) The price! An enormous lunch for 2, with green tea, was only $32! 

10) Not having to eat at the gross chain restaurants in Schaumburg? #WINNING"

My parents have been bringing my Sister and I here for years. We&#39;re now bringing the next generation of our family here for traditional Japanese food.

I ordered a bowl of Mix Chazuke for $8.95. It&#39;s hot broth served with rice and wasabi. 
You can choose to pay less and have just one item from the Mix with your rice and broth: a sheet of nori (seaweed) for $5.95, Ume (pickled plum) for $6.95, Sake (salmon) for $6.95, Tarako (broiled cod roe) for $6.95. Because I don&#39;t like umeboshi (pickled plum), I asked to substitute it with takuan (pickled daikon radish).

Beef Aspara-Maki appetizer for $8.95. It&#39;s sliced beef rolled with asparagus and broiled with teriyaki sauce and a Kiliuea roll for $11.95. It&#39;s the darkest part of the tuna (and the most expensive)

Sakura popped up with a promising rating and good reviews, so off we went.

The chefs at the bar were the first people we saw when we walked in, and they all gave friendly greetings in Japanese, and it wasn&#39;t too long before we were shown to a table. It did take them a few minutes to bring us menus. After that, it was a little rough because we thought we were going to have to wave someone down for a menu. But they eventually brought us menus and hot towels to wipe down our hands, which was a nice touch. 

We&#39;d had the impression that we were going into a sushi place, but truth be told, this place is probably better with its appetizers and entrees. You can generally tell what a place is devoted to by the size of its selection. There was a sushi menu, and a few specials, but it was pretty clear that this place is more devoted to good hot entrees and appetizers. 

Since we&#39;re a little adventurous and pretty flexible, we decided to get a couple of rolls that caught our attention, and we each ordered our own noodle soup. I got the ramen, and my bf got soba. We did share an order of crab shumai and realized that we could probably go to any Asian market and buy a whole bag, but hey, at least we discovered its existence. :)

Our server was pleasant but not pushy, and the food came FAST and hot. I mean...I&#39;m pretty sure we had all of our food under 10 minutes. The sushi portions were typical, and the entree portions were huge. My bf took some of my ramen, and I still couldn&#39;t finish it. 

Sakura is situated in a nondescript strip mall near Woodfield, and I was glad we found it. We generally have defaulted to nearby Mitsuwa for ramen or sushi when we have the craving, and though we have no plans to abandon Mitsuwa, we were pleased to find this little place that offers a variety to meet different Japanese food cravings. We live in the city and won&#39;t make regular trips, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back when we&#39;re in the area."

The place seemed authentically Japanese.  We saw many Japanese patrons, as well as a lot of Japanese text on the menu.  I wonder if there are some kind of exclusive Japanese-only menu items?

I love good sushi, but hate spending much money.  However, there tends to be difficulty getting one without doing the other.  In this case I did spend more money than I would have liked, which was not totally unexpected, but a lot of other places I&#39;ve been would have at least included a miso soup and/or a house salad for the price.

I&#39;ve had a lot of green tea in my day (including in Japan), and the hot green tea here was surprisingly bland.  Maybe I just burned my taste buds off with that first scalding sip, but it tasted like nothing more than hot water with the subliminal implication of being green tea - which is surprising, with all of the sediment I saw at the bottom.

My husband wanted the tempura mozzarella for an appetizer, which was light, crisp, and tasty, so no complaints there.  It came with four salted green beans (not edamame) and ginger dipping sauce.

The unagi rolls were delicious, as well as the Futo maki we ordered.  As far as the quality of the food goes, we have little to complain about.  It was very tasty, at least as tasty as some of the other good sushi places we&#39;ve eaten.

The low point of our meal was the service.  There are some people who will complain about the service wherever they go because they are just unpleasant individuals.  I am not one of those people.  Usually I am tolerant of even very indifferent service, and while I don&#39;t mean to complain even now, I must say our server made us feel pretty unwelcome.  I don&#39;t know if she was overworked or maybe was just having an off-night, but she pretty much just flew through when bringing us food and the check, and had a demeanor that made my husband say mid-meal &#34;I don&#39;t think she likes me.&#34;  I didn&#39;t take it THAT personally (there was no obvious reason for her to be put off by us), but she definitely made me feel like we were imposing by eating here.  I wouldn&#39;t say it ruined our meal, but it did kind of make us feel like our patronage wasn&#39;t wanted.  The chefs behind the sushi bar, on the other hand, were quite friendly in welcoming us in to the restaurant and wishing us a good night when we departed.

All things considered we may try this place again, but on the other hand there are other equally good places we can go for sushi without feeling discouraged.  I don&#39;t want to sound overly dramatic about our experience because really it was only a case of subtle discomfort, so certainly if you are curious to try this place I would encourage you to do so."
sakura-woodfield-rolling-meadows,Phil S.,asP08n8OwVhIg2hyff8DFQ,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,1,0,133,1025,J1kBbS5yevwoqa600SFrHg,2.0,2012-09-30,"We decided to try this place out after hearing good reviews about the ramen and rolls. I&#39;m not much of a roll fan because a roll is basically just over-riced sushi but I&#39;m enjoy a good bowl of noodles.

It was past peak dinner hours on a Saturday but the place was still bristling with activity.

We started with the Kaki Fry and was pleasantly surprised by the fresh tenderness of the oysters. We tried to order a beef tongue appetizer but it wasn&#39;t available so we ordered a Dynamite Roll instead. The roll was decent as far as rolls go but we noticed it was a little on the salty side and the flavor wasn&#39;t coming from the sauce either. This was a foresight of dishes to come.

Ramen and Yaki Soba were next up on our list and we were pleasantly surprised with presentation. The ramen came in a dark broth topped with a harboiled egg half and various meats. The yaki soba came as a steaming heap of noodles and bountiful meat topped with dry seasonings and the whole dish looked very smokey and dark. Presentation was great but at first bite we both said the same thing: wow this is salty! Serious sodium overload at this place. My first thought about this tragedy is that they must be catering to the typical American tongue. 

What a shame because the noodles were fresh made and they had a great consistency and the other flavors seemed like they would&#39;ve been fantastic as well had the salt not overpowered everything. The yaki was cooked to smokey perfection and had such a great smokey flavor and the ramen noodles themselves were soft and chewy just like a fresh noodle should be but I was constantly reaching for water to calm the salt beast thrashing around in our dishes. I wish they would realize that adding flavor does not mean adding more salt because the flavors had real promise.

Service was a little slow but we had one lonely waitress serving one entire side of the place by herself and she was walking back and forth getting dishes and drinks non-stop. She was polite enough but I could tell she was extremely tired and didn&#39;t even have enough energy for a fake smile. She did her best though and we received everything we needed as long as we requested it. At the rate this woman was working it would&#39;ve been impossible for her to remember all the small details. What&#39;s funny was there was at least eight guys crowded behind the sushi bar and grill area. 

Overall, I was not impressed with this place and left longing for the noodles at Sankyu. It&#39;s too bad that Sankyu has the worst service I&#39;ve ever encountered. I&#39;d probably go back to Sakura again someday but I&#39;m going to have to request they take it easy on the soy sauce if I do go back."

Sushi may seem expensive for those who like to eat non-authentic sushi (like dragon roll and that kind with mayo, etc.) because their sushi is real/authentic Japanese style, and it is very reasonably priced for the quality. Menchi-katsu curry is one of my favorite dishes. Menchi-katsu is a panko covered deep-fried hamburger mixture, a Japanese home-food, and that comes with their home-made curry with rice = yummy!! The restaurant also has early dinner specials if you get there until 6:30 Monday-Thursday, and they are very reasonably priced.  For sushi, my favorite is Sakura sushi, Edo-style authentic sushi.

We had Dynamite and Mexican rolls. The Dynamite rolls were not as flavorful as we&#39;d hoped, but it showcased the fresh fish very well. Our server said the Mexican rolls were a favorite dish among many -- and for good reason! Great flavor with good spice, if you like jalepeno.

Our server also recommended the aspari-maki appetizer. It&#39;s asparigus wrapped in broiled beef with teriyaki sauce, cut into rolls like sushi. I&#39;ve never seen an appetizer like this before, but it was fantastic. I want to try so many more items on the menu, but it&#39;ll be tough to pass this one up.

Our server was very good. He was friendly and gave great recommendations. We were too full to try all of his recommendations, but we&#39;ll be back to try the tempura and squid appetizers (he even came by our table to show us someone else&#39;s squid), along with more sushi.

As other reviewers have noted, we noticed a number of Japanese businessmen eating here. Most of them appeared to be regulars as they were greeted personally by the chefs.

I&#39;ve started coming here since I was a little kid. All the dishes are fresh and consistently delish. I tried almost everything on their menu. There was nothing that I did not like. Price is just right; it&#39;s not overly expensive. I highly recommend Sakura for authentic Japanese food lovers!"

If you get stuck in Schaumburg and need a sensible meal that isn&#39;t a themed restaurant that has been specially designed to vacuum money out of the pockets of the poor saps that get sent to conventions here, then take refuge in this authentic and delicious Japanese restaurant. Always a good sign in a sushi house to hear most of the other guests speaking Japanese. I went with the tonkatsu (breaded pork) with veggie sauce and it was excellent. My only complaint is that there is no curry option. I also sampled the gyoza, miso soup, yakisoba, and shrimp tempura. The yakisoba was amazing! Nothing creative, just the staple dishes done very well. The service was really cheerful and fast. You can tell that people like being there for work. I like being there too."

Their steak teriaki combo plate is great when they don&#39;t overcook the steak.  First time I had it , It was OUTSTANDING. Second time, a little over cooked, so good, but not as great. 

They get 4 stars only because :
1) they are a little pricey. Plan on dropping 50-100 dollars on a dinner for 2.
2) there&#39;s something a little off with the salad dressing.  I love the dressing from benihana, kampai, yu sun, etc.. but here, it&#39;s got a strange flavor.  Not a fan of it.

If you get the chance -- order the Beef Tataki -  it&#39;s awesome delicious. :)"

The Sukiyaki was as good as last time which is nothing special and the Hamachi Kama although tasty, really did a number on my stomach and points south (at least I think that&#39;s what it was).

There was a lot of food but the steak teriyaki was overdone and a little too chewy.  The dragon roll was ok, but not great.  The miso soup and salad that came along was good.

The place looks a bit run down but don&#39;t let that fool you - the food here is excellent.  We started with an order of yakitori.  It was awesome - the chicken practically melted in your mouth and the sauce was just right.  I got the Yakisoba with beef and my g/f got the chicken teriyaki.  Both dishes were very good.  Mine could have used a bit more beef but that is really the only complaint.  Hers was a huge dish - we had to box a good portion of it for the next day.  The salads that came were done very well also.  They had that classic ginger dressing but these guys got it right.  Not too much ginger and just the right amount of sweet.  It was very well done - cool and refreshing greens that still had some snap to them.

All in all a good place for japanese food.  I have not tried the sushi.  My g/f has and says it is excellent."

The fish is terrifically fresh on a friday night. I had the sashimi dinner and each piece tasted buttery smooth.

My girlfriend had a dynamite roll and a spider roll. the Dynamite role was good, with Tuna and Yellowtail rolled up, but we could have done without the sauce that topped each piece. The soft shell crab in the spider roll was over-cooked. It tasted ok, but we&#39;ve had better.

Upfront, yes, the place is not pretty to look at. It has an 80s feel to it for some reason. That weirdness aside, this place was really good.

The wait staff was really friendly, the gyoza and the rolls were super tasty. I did not try any nigiri or sashimi, as it was just a lunch run. Philly roll was amazing ... a simple roll that a lot of place find a way to mess up. Also, a wicked tobiko roll (the Sakura roll) ... six pieces topped with 3 types of tobiko beautifully placed on some super spicy sauce.

One thing I am super picky about is the texture of my rice, be it in rolls or nigiri. I could feel every grain of rice in my mouth. It was wonderful!

On top of it I always see the same sushi chefs working.  I have tried the sushi and the noodle dishes.  Lets start off w/ their bread and butter, ok let me reiterate that their soy sauce and wasabi....Sushi never failed me here yet, along w/ the out of towners that I bring.  Rainbow is always a must and so are the rest when I go (911, spicy tuna, spider, and dynamite)  I would only advise that you be drinking some of their excellent sake.  If you would go Felipe style it would be sake bombs, for the rookies out there its sapporro and a sake shot.  ;)  Well w/ any of those rolls you cant go wrong, as well as the noodle dishes.

We were seated and brought water and some chips and some kind of green dip.  I think it was a cilantro-based thing.  The water glasses are like fluted champagne glasses, so you don&#39;t get much.  I got one refill the whole time we were there and that just isn&#39;t enough for me.

I couldn&#39;t wait to have one of their margaritas.  Last time I was there they were so good!  Not this time.  It was a watered down sweet tart.  No liquor, just tasted like the mixer.  They were $10 EACH.  I&#39;m ok with paying $10 for a good drink, but these were not worthy.

There was lots of waiting during this visit.  Waiting for beverages, waiting for someone to take our order, waiting for some water.  It just seemed like we were waiting all the time!

Hubby and I both got tacos.  They use LOTS of cilantro.  I&#39;m ok with cilantro, but there wasn&#39;t much else on my taco.  I didn&#39;t want cheese.  I explained to the waiter that I couldn&#39;t have cheese and then there was cheese on my beans.

It just was a big disappointment and I won&#39;t be going back.  What happened?"

I&#39;m not even sure where to begin. Everything was excellent. We went on a Groupon. 2 drinks, guacamole and 2 meals up to $19.99 for $22.00. The best deal we&#39;ve ever gotten. We will be back Groupon or not.  The margaritas we spot on. When I order a drink I like to taste the alcohol. The guacamole that came with our Groupon was soooo good we ordered another. My husband even wanted to order a third. I had the Red Snapper - Wow. Cooked perfectly. Yes it&#39;s traditional and you get the whole fish! The spicy red sauce was perfect and didn&#39;t overwhelm the flavor of the fish. The grilled vegetables were abundant. Usually when you order a dish like this you get a few veggies. Tons of red, green, orange peppers and onions.

My husband had the Camerones (shrimp) fajitas. We always share. Big shrimp, cooked perfectly and again with a ton of veggies. We ordered both corn and flour tortillas. AMAZING! HOME MADE! And everything made to order. 

We went on a Tuesday evening and it wasn&#39;t busy so I can&#39;t comment on service. But the service we did receive was attentive and on key. Didn&#39;t have to ask for anything and they didn&#39;t hover. I can&#39;t wait to go back this  weekend."

I&#39;ve been here before two other times.  First time awesome and delicious.  Second with groupon.  They give you child portions when you have a groupon FYI.  They knew we had it from beginning on that second visit.  Another reviewer said they added a surcharge with their groupon.  I&#39;m guessing they did that because they didn&#39;t know they had a groupon?  Not sure, but I think it&#39;s bad business to do that.  I won&#39;t be back."

The owner is always there and has such pride in the quality of his food. He talks about the mesquite fired grill and his freshly squeezed lime juice in his custom drinks. You can tell how important it is that the food is done right. 
And then there is a guacamole.... You just need to try it! It is awesome.
A few other visits were not as great- shrimp in the mixed fajitas were buttery, like a scampi; did not compliment the other tastes on the dish."

Especially after some of the previous reviews. From the look of the outside this place doesn&#39;t look like it would be that nice on the inside. But the inside was nicely decorated and had a good size bar. The inside also has a nice mesquite smell, since that&#39;s the type of wood they use in the kitchen.

We both ordered a margarita to start, since it came with the groupon. It was much larger than expected and very good. One of the previous reviews mentioned no salt on the rim but both of ours came with salt. We also had chips with guacamole, the green salsa, and the red salsa. I loved the guacamole it was fresh and tasted just right. Also the green salsa was very good. I didn&#39;t like the flavor of the red salsa but that could just be a personal preference.

Now  I had the steak burrito and my mom had the potato flautas. My burrito was the perfect size, not overly large like some places, and I really enjoyed the fresh avocado  in it. My mom thought the flautas were ok. But she usually doesn&#39;t order flautas anyway. 

Our server was also one of the owners. He was very friendly and easy to talk to. He honored the total value of the groupon, and the gratuity wasn&#39;t included in it. So I don&#39;t know what other reviews were talking about. When we were getting ready to leave he mentioned that they have karaoke on the weekends, and they have all different types of music. They also had lights setup on the inside like you would see at at dance club so people can dance along with the karaoke.

Overall this was a good meal, and I will be back with friends."

A Spacious donning room that clearly is used for dancing other nights.

The chips and salsa were good, and the guacamole was very good. I had a steak and my wife had the enchiladas - it was nice that the enchiladas were not smothered in cheese for a change.

We only drank beer.

Food was good, higher quality than most Mexican places. Can&#39;t say a lot about the kitchen, we were the only order, they better get it right.

I also had a Groupon for this restaurant, and they did charge 18% gratuity upfront which they did tax. However, that is about all of the negative feedback I can give - the rest of our experience was delightful.

Our Groupon was for 2 drinks, guacamole, and 2 dinners up to $19.99 each. We went on Memorial Day Sunday - the weather that weekend was not super conducive to picnicking or barbecuing.  I really did not have super high expectations - the restaurant is located in a strip mall that has seen better days. But the inside of the restaurant was very nice - low lighting, beautiful tiled floors and walls, and lovely painted murals.

Once in, we were quickly seated. Although it was 6:30 or so, there was only one other occupied table in the restaurant. Our waiter Rene came over to take a drink order. Because of the other review, I mentioned the Groupon right off and there was NO issue. Rene brought our drinks. The margarita was cold and tasty, not homemade but did not skimp on the alcohol. Then a young lady came over to make salsa and guacamole to order. I again mentioned the Groupon, thinking that since the guacamole was included that it might be pre-made, not made to order. I was wrong though, and she made us some delicious guacamole - the ingredients all seemed very fresh. We also opted to have her make us both some red &amp; green salsa - I preferred the green and my honey preferred the red. They will make them as spicy or mild as you wish. One caveat here - when we got the bill, we saw we had been charged for the salsa, which is unusual in a Mexican joint. About $3 apiece, but portions were generous and both were delicious. Had I known up front though we likely would have selected one or the other.

We both ordered fajitas for our entrees - I got chicken and my man got steak. Both were very good, but due to the seemingly high quality and freshness of the ingredients. We both agreed that perhaps they should marinate the meats for a bit more flavor. Even so we would order again - the veggies were so flavorful and cooked to crisp-tender like we enjoy. The fajitas were served with pico de gallo, charro beans, and tortillas. The tortillas were homemade and super yummy - no comparison to packaged. My honey also asked for rice because he is not a bean fan. The waiter brought him both because he said he really wanted him to at least try the beans. He did and ate the whole bowl - they are not typical refried beans, it is more of a bean soup with whole pinto beans, large chunks of ham, and a nice smoky flavor. The rice was just OK - the beans were a better flavor choice.

As we ate, the restaurant got more &amp; more busy, but the service did not waver and we never felt we were being rushed. I really wanted to try the chocoflan for dessert, but I was just too full. We left, but not before telling Rene who seems to be the proprietor as well as a server how much we had enjoyed our meal and his restaurant. 

BONUS - when we got our bill, there was a coupon inside for $29.99 fajitas, margaritas, and guacamole for two for another visit. So we will be going back.  Give this place a try!"

Location was easy to get to and the inside was nice compared to others in town we have visited.  We went on a Sunday evening and there was only one other couple there.  The drinks were GOOD; big and like others said, you could taste the alcohol.  Guacamole was decent as were the chips/salsa.  Now for the food, eh. Nothing wrong with it but nothing to write home about either.  I had enchiladas with mole (2 cheese, 1 chicken) and my sister had enchiladas suizas (beef).  My major gripe with the food was the cheese...it was like the monterrey jack and cheddar mix in a bag you get at the grocery store.  I found that incredibly weird when they could have used so many other delicious MEXICAN cheeses.  It ruined an otherwise decent mole.  They also used that cheese on the order of nachos we got and it never really melted on either dish.

I&#39;d definitely try them again; maybe we just had an off night."

I&#39;ve been here twice. Once when they just opened and once now. I didn&#39;t like it the first time I tried it, but decided to give this place a second chance. I just don&#39;t get why people like it so much.

Everything is sooooooo salty. 

I guess the best thing about this place is the waffle fries... just that nobody else has them in that shape. They still taste like a french fry. I was grateful that they didn&#39;t put much salt on the fries... I guess to balance out the sodium content in the chicken?? 

So today I got the chicken nugget meal. I paid over $8 for some tiny pieces of very, very salty chicken and room temperature waffle fries. Not worth it at all.

The first time I went here, I got a chicken sandwich and I was not impressed with that either. It was salty back then, salty now.

Most likely will never come back."

When you go to McDonald&#39;s or any other fast food restaurant they act like they could care less to help you but here was a lot different &amp; I applaud their hiring practice.  

The food itself was delicious.  I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich &amp; a sweet tea with fries.  The spicy chicken was by far the best that I have had &amp; it actually had a kick to it.  The sweet tea was very good as well.  The fries were nice &amp; hot &amp; were tasty as well.  This business was very busy &amp; they got the orders to the counter &amp; drive thru very fast.

I&#39;m from North Carolina, and Chic-Fil-A always makes me think of my home! Sweet tea is amazing - I get it half sweet, half un-sweet. When I was there, a man basically spilled his entire drink on my boots, and immediately, one of the ladies on staff came and asked if I wanted a wet towel. Within 1 minute, she had given me a warm damp towel to clean my boots with! 

Very polite staff, and the food is great. Only thing was I wish my sandwich was pipping hot, as it was actually pretty lukewarm - something I was confused about b/c it was so busy! 

Also they give you these plastic cups (i&#39;ve never seen them at any other chic-fil-a&#39;s) to hold your straws, sauce, etc.

The biscuits are thick and fluffy. Because this franchise started in the South, the biscuit and gravy is pretty amazing too.

There are plenty of other breakfast items but these are the only two I choose to order. My boyfriend is more health conscious than me so he enjoys any one of their chicken breast breakfast sandwich a la carte.

I have been hearing from everyone how Chick-Fil-A has the best waffle fries and the best chicken sandwiches. We wanted to grab a quick dinner the other night and we chose to check out Chick-Fil-A. We went in the restaurant because we wanted to see what they had. The drive thru is not the best way to experience a place, if you ask me. 

I&#39;m glad we went in to get our food. The staff is VERY friendly. The place is CLEEEEEAN!! There was probably 50-75 people in this joint and the place was hoppin&#39;; there were people cleaning tables and keeping the condiment station in order. Well trained staff, good job!!

We took a look over their menu and the nuggets stood out to me. My fiance went for the sandwich. We shared a large waffle fry and there was more than enough for the two of us. The nuggets were perfectly breaded. Here&#39;s my favorite part: they had a Chick-fil-a sauce that I tried. Seriously!! Best damn sauce they offer. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the sweet and sour, but their chick-fil-a sauce was like a smokey honey mustard, and it was excellent. I&#39;m not even really a fan of mustard but it was surprisingly good.

My fiance inhaled his sandwich, so I&#39;m guessing it was pretty good. I can&#39;t wait to go back and next time, we&#39;ll eat in because the fries were a little cooled off by the time we got home to eat.

Way to go, Chick-Fil-A, you made a new patron out of me!! :)"

But man oh man do I have an issue with their business practices. They donate money to anti-gay groups which I am SO not okay with (I can link you some articles if you have any interest).

Their chicken tenders are delicious and taste homemade (non-processed tasting if ya know what I mean). I also have a soft side for waffle fries and theirs were made just so - the right amount of soft center and crispy edges.

Finally, the cookies n cream shake took me over the edge. It was soooo good. By the time I got to it the thing was so melty and delicious that I just sat and slurped it down with no breaks in between. Can you say &#39;fat butt&#39;?

Minus a star for having a non-varietous menu but I guess they&#39;re sticking to what they know - good chicken.

This place is no exception. As far as service goes, you will not find a better restaurant in the quick-service industry. EVERYONE is happy to serve you like you are the most important person in the world. (Well, second-most based on CFA&#39;s religious views.) They have employees in the dining area to tend to their guests to do things like offer refills (known as &#34;refreshing their beverage&#34;), take plates and even pour pepper on salads. This is above and beyond what most QSRs do.

However, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m a big fan of their chicken product. I don&#39;t know if it is because they use pressure cooking, but their chicken sandwiches themselves taste soggy and mealy. I like good service, but I like good food as well. And the food here does not resonate well with me. In addition, you only get 2 pickles on a sandwich and the rest of the toppings you add yourself. Also, no onions, and I&#39;m a big fan of the raw onion.

Also, expect long lines especially in the drive-thru. Even in this very liberal part of Illinois, Chick Fil A has LOTS of fans in the area who have no problem waiting 15-20 for their meal.

I might give these guys a try again in the future, though."

Spicy chicken and waffle fries, what else do I need to say.  Not greasy, crispy, tasty and tender.  This was my first time here.  I tried yesterday and I am pleased to say, so did everyone else.

The spicy chicken sammich is my personal fave and if you feel like tacking on a few inches to your waistline, try any of their shakes. Totally legit.

I&#39;m not shy about doling out 5 stars for truly excellent meals, but when it comes to fast food - Chik-Fil-A is the French Laundry of its arena.  In-and-out burger is a very very close second, due mainly to its disadvantage in the french fry department.  Back to Chik, the spicy chicken deluxe (add bacon!!!) is the best fried chicken sandwich I&#39;ve ever had.  

And those waffle fries?  Come on now -  amazing.  Top it off with a cookies and cream milkshake and you&#39;ve just enjoyed a nice slice of heaven.  

You&#39;ll never experience more courteous personnel at a fast food restaurant.  Employees rove the dining area and make sure everything is alright, and will gladly get a refill for you.

I have liked everything I&#39;ve had from here and will go if I am up for the 15 ride, then possible long line in the drive through.

When I am not up for it- I get a Wendy&#39;s spicy chicken sandwich and call it a day.

There shakes are ok- a bit too sweet for me.   I have been given a shake cup with a hole poked in the bottom from there stirring thing.  It was in the drive through and I didn&#39;t feel like getting out and I sure wasn&#39;t going to loop around to get a new one.

Ah how you have grown on me oh chick-fil-a burger! I can&#39;t say that I am on the addicted bandwagon, but the chicken burgers here are a nice change from the meat burgers of McD. Instead of finding a grinded up patty of chicken meat, you get whole chicken meat with crispy batter topped with a fresh bun with lettuce and cheese. You can customize it by adding on the different sauces they have (chick fil-a sauce, bbq, polynesian, sweet and sour, etc) The waffle fries are a huge plus, something about gigantic fries that you can dunk in the sauce. Great prices and quick service (I got my food even before paying)

Pro: fresh chicken burger, multiple sauces to customize your meal, waffle fries, quick service

Cons: close on Sundays, food is sometime too quick (i.e. it may have been sitting prepped already)

This location, like the one in Wheaton, has a kids&#39; play area, and make sure to pick up a free breakfast coupon in the entry vestibule while they&#39;re still good.

-The owner and his wife are usually there working which is good to see
-The food is delicious!

I had one snafu recently where I ordered my meal (in the drive through) with no pickles- and when I got back to my office I realized they misheard and put on extra pickles.  (I really, really, really dislike pickles.)  The owner was really great about correcting the mistake, and I felt like he really cared.  That&#39;s why I continue to return.  Too often major fast food corps. don&#39;t care and that leaves me very likely not to return after a mistake.  Here I felt the exact opposite.

I ate here when they were two weeks old so I expected there to still be a few kinks in their service and indeed there were. When you first walk into the store, it has the same look and feel as most Chick-Fil-A&#39;s with the same menu format and the same table set up as most other Chick-Fil-A&#39;s. However, since it is a rather busy place and more chaotic due to the heavy traffic it incurs, it&#39;s a bit crazy trying to figure out where the line for the registers form and how to navigate your way. Fortunately, the service people in front are holding up their hand when they&#39;re ready to take your order, but it&#39;s still difficult to figure out where to line up. Also, it&#39;s difficult to find a place to park the first time you&#39;re there, since the most natural place to park is next to the restaurant but the most intuitive place to park ends up being the place to the drive through.

The food quality and service are all decent. I was, however, a bit surprised that they didn&#39;t get my food order right the first time. I ordered a sandwich without pickles and my sandwich came with pickles. I also ordered ahead of three people and I got my food after them. Ordinarily, if my food was customized, I wouldn&#39;t mind for my food to come a bit later, but I ordered a generic meal so I was a bit surprised it took so long to come out.

All the chicken food here is awesome from their Chicken Sandwich Deluxes to their Salads to the Nuggets. I just enjoy eating a healthier meal (vs. something like a McDonald&#39;s) so I like coming here. I&#39;m sure this place will have the kinks worked out in a few weeks. I recommend it."

If that doesn&#39;t tell you how busy this place is, go see for yourself! I was there for lunch during the week and was lucky enough to find a decent parking spot and a place to sit in the restaurant. The drive-thru was jammed. Here&#39;s my thoughts:

Food: The waffle fries are excellent - great flavor and no signs of oil or grease. The chicken sandwiches are good and the portion is a decent size. My only thing with Chick-Fil-A is that my first experience with them was in suburban Atlanta, and I have yet to enjoy one of their chicken sandwiches as much as I enjoyed that first one. That one seemed to be spiced just a little differently - haven&#39;t found it to be the same since.

Service: Amazingly prompt for as busy as they were. One unusual thing that happened - an employee stopped by my table and asked if I&#39;d like a refill. Before I could reply, a manager (whose last name was the same as the store operator&#39;s name on the receipt - may have been his wife) pulled the employee away to talk to her about something that didn&#39;t sound too urgent.  Th employee returned a few minutes later and retrieved another drink for me.

I&#39;ll be back - though it may not be like my 1st experience, their chicken sandwiches are still pretty good and filling. Good to see this chain in the Chicago area - the more food offerings the better!"

I mean, what&#39;s the big deal?

I get it now. I really do. Never has a cherry popping been so delicious. THAT chicken! So tender, so juicy. They only sell chicken things, and they do it right. The Spicy Chicken Deluxe meal that I ordered made me very happy. It was spicy, there was pepperjack cheese, there were WAFFLE FRIES (the superior of all fries, it goes, in this order of awesomeness: waffle, curly, crinkle, thick-cut, then shoe-string. tots not included, obvi), and so many sauces! And an IceDream cone to round out the meal? (Banana pudding shake would have been overkil). I was in fat kid heaven.

It was pretty busy at an off-peak hour on a holiday, but the staff were really enthusiastic and efficient. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever encountered such friendly fast-food staff. The guy who took our order gave us SO MANY SAUCES! There were other employees around the store keeping it clean. Love the mayo and ketchup (squeeze or dip!) options at their condiments counter too. Breakfast menu seems totally awesome. Chicken biscuit, get in my mouth please.

Sure, this is not destination or fine dining. But, if you&#39;re looking for a flavorful chicken sandwich in the area, Chick-Fil-A will not disappoint - get the spicy chicken! Plus, a meal for 2 only set us back $13. Winner winner, chicken (sandwich) dinner!"

After three visits, I can honestly say my past KFC sandwiches have been more crispy (the chicken), the bread less soggy (than Chick-Fil-A&#39;s) and a better overall value.

Additionally, my cottage-cut fries were crispy on my first visit (the week they opened to much undeserved fanfare), but the fries have been too salty and floppy the last two times.

So that&#39;s it, they don&#39;t deserve 5 stars. If you really think they&#39;re better than KFC or Popeye&#39;s, please do yourself a favor and try the latter again to make sure your perception of the Chick-Fil-A brand isn&#39;t overpowering your taste buds.

Better yet, stick with Wendy&#39;s Spicy Chicken Sandwich, which is simply an A+ compared to the sandwich lauded at Chick-Fil-A.

Side Note: Some Chicagoland radio show asked folks what would be their ideal &#34;Fast Food Dream Mix&#34; and 90% of the callers named that Wendy&#39;s chicken sandwich for that category. It seems they do know something."

If, after delivering your order you, out of habit, go ahead and say &#39;thank you&#39; after they give you change.  Staff has been trained to trot out a very worn &#39;my pleasure&#39; cliche.  Chick-Fil-A staff will not say THANK YOU.

If it&#39;s a good local restaurant, it gets 2 stars at best.  If it&#39;s other fast food, i.e. McDonalds, it gets 4 stars.  And if it&#39;s high end fast food a la Smashburger, it&#39;s a solid 3 stars.  Let&#39;s go with that.

There&#39;s not really much point to reviewing fast food - it&#39;s cheap, it&#39;s bad for you and it&#39;s the same across the country.  But there are few Chick-Fil-A&#39;s in the Chicago area so I might as well.  The best part about the chicken here is the southern-fried coating, which has a better flavor than anything KFC has to offer and seems to lock in the moisture pretty well.  I would recommend the chicken fingers to get the full experience unaffected by anything else, as my spicy chicken sandwich had too much bun and toppings to really enjoy the chicken.

Chick-Fil-A is fast food. There&#39;s nothing special or fancy or 5-star worthy about it. It&#39;s cheap, fast, and anything but good for you. At least if it tasted really good, I could justify the calories and fat content once in a while. 

I was dragged against to CFA against my own will - my dinner date just HAD to have one of those coveted chicken sandwiches. I was starving, my blood sugar was dropping, and I was getting cranky so I didn&#39;t put up a fight. At that point, I was about to chew off my own arm and wasn&#39;t in the mood for a wait at a sit down restaurant.

As much as I try to eat healthy, I wasn&#39;t about to come to the infamous Chick-Fil-A for the first time and order a salad or a wrap. So I opted for some chicken nuggets, a diet coke and a handful of my dinner companion&#39;s waffle fries. Were they good? They weren&#39;t bad. But they certainly weren&#39;t the best nuggs I&#39;ve ever eaten. Not to mention I couldn&#39;t help but think I was eating pieces of chicken pumped with hormones and no beak. (I think watching certain food documentaries has warped my mind).

I was overwhelmed with the sauce choices so I went with BBQ, Polynesian, and the Chick-Fil-A sauce. The BBQ sauce was fine - very standard. The Polynesian was your typical sweet &amp; sour. The CFA sauce - gross. It tasted of fats and egg yolks.The fries were okay - they weren&#39;t overly greasy (which is nice) but I would have preferred them a little crispier. I watched my sidekick inhale a deluxe chicken sandwich, so I&#39;m guessing he thought it was pretty good.

Let&#39;s be honest here. Chick-Fil-A is FAST FOOD. So, it&#39;s hard for me to push past the 2-star zone. If I did, I&#39;d be putting Chick-Fil-A in the same category as some renown Chi-town restaurants. 

Would I return? If I was starving. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to stop in, but I might give one of the salads or wraps a whirl."

It was some kind of kids day there and they had the Chick-Fil-A cow walking around greeting the kids, a coloring station for the kids, and a station for the kids to put toppings on their ice cream. The staff were genuinely friendly with the children. They have disposable table covers that stick to the table for young children to eat over.

The chicken is so juicy and filling. The waffle fries are beyond awesome! The food is not greasy and does not taste like they&#39;ve been deep frying the fries in 1 year old oil like other food chains I&#39;ve been to. The staff are very polite and display very good customer service.

I even noticed and LOVE the way they clean their tables. It&#39;s not a yucky dish towel that has been dipped under water and wiped on every table each time w/o being cleaned after each use. They use wipes from a wipes container. How frigging awesome is that! I don&#39;t have to worry about a yucky towel smudge of water on the table when I sit down.

Shove it and eat else where and stop wasting your time trying to make people not eat here. This place has alot of better qualities than all the other food chains we have eaten at for decades. They even SPEAK FLUENT ENGLISH!!!

Food, service, staff, customer service, and quality of everything is just awesome. Need I say more!?"

The food was surprisingly great. They also had great customer service- people came around and actually checked to see I was enjoying my meal and to see if they could get me anything. It was sort of impressive. The store its self was clean and organized and sort of crazy with a double drive-thru that looked a bit like the tollway. Only at the end of paying your toll, you get chicken. Also, given the state of our tollways, the food may have actually been cheaper.

I also like that they are closed on Sunday. It&#39;s rare to see that sort of nicety in the fast food industry on behalf of faith or the employees or both. Any way you look at it, good for them.

So yah... really impressive, even with all the hype I was still impressed. If you haven&#39;t gone, join me in saying &#34;eff you,&#34; to your diet. Once in a while."

When I first tried it I didn&#39;t see what the big deal was but that&#39;s because I had the chicken nuggets. The gold is in the chicken sandwich. Add a little of their Polynesian sauce and yum! The chicken biscuit with cheese for breakfast is awesome too. 

The service here is fantastic. Even during the busy lunch hour the wait for the food was minimal and there is plenty of seating. 

Now that this location is open, which is close to where I work, I can see myself coming here quite often. As it stands I&#39;ve been here three times in less than a month!

My only gripe is the amount of waffle fries in the small leaves a lot to be desired."

Numerous healthy options and even the fried chicken sandwich with no butter has like 9 grams of fat I believe. Nuggets, Strips, chargrilled are all great.

I looooove their sauces I think that&#39;s what makes them stand out against other fast food joints.  The Polynesian is my fav.  Tip: dip the hash browns in it, really tasty!

So I was excited to hear that chick-fil-a was coming to Schaumburg.  I&#39;ve always enjoyed their chicken here.  Some people find the batter to be a bit bland, but I&#39;ve never really experienced that.  For a fast food place, chick-fil-a is semi healthy.  most sandwiches are under 500 calories.  None of their sandwiches come with sauce, so that allows you to put whatever and how ever much sauce you want on your sandwich.  I&#39;m very happy to say that they have Texas Pete hot sauce here which I have been deprived of for so long.  

My favorite by far is the Chicken Biscuit w/ Texas Pete applied liberally.  The biscuit is tender, not dry, and of course the chicken is delish.  The spicy chicken is also very good.  

As for the fries and extras, I can&#39;t really speak much about them.  The fries are ordinary waffle fries.

The Schaumburg store is clean and the staff is friendly.  It&#39;s extremely crowded now, but that&#39;s only because it is the newest place to eat.  There really isn&#39;t a whole lot to do in Schaumburg except eat or go shopping.

If you go to this location and have tiny kiddies (like under age 3 or so), I highly recommend the indoor playspace.

Empty tables were immediately cleaned, and there was a small army of people REFILLING BEVERAGES for people at tables as well as clearing trays. Amazing!

And, yes, there were a lot of kids there.

This was my first visit, so I went for the basic Chick-Fil-A sandwich meal with medium drink and waffle fries.

After wading through the dining area looking for a CLEAN table (c&#39;mon, Chick-Fil-A!) I finally found a spot right in front of the enclosed kids&#39; playground. 

I would say the chicken sandwich was good...moist and tasty. But it only came with a couple of pickles. Definitely could&#39;ve used some lettuce, maybe a tomato and some mayonnaise. 

The waffle fries were just average.

Between the Kids&#39; Night, the unkempt dining area and the truly average food, I won&#39;t be in a rush to go back.

This location has two drive throughs and has been busy since the moment they opened.  Service was fast even though it was packed inside and in both drive through lanes.

As a child in the 70&#39;s , down in Springfield Illinois, we used to pick up Chick-Fil-A sandwiches at the mall carryout. They didn&#39;t have sit down restaurants back then, and their menu was very basic. Southern style, chicken sandwiches with pickles on them. Delicious.

The Original sandwich is exactly the same. Delicious. But oddly, I found my meal today not filling, even with the waffle fry side. I could have easily eaten a couple of them, but refrained. Now, maybe way back when I was  a teen I was consuming several at a sitting, but still, you don&#39;t want to leave a restaurant still hungry after ordering a combo.

Last time I went, I had a shake as well, and was satisfied, but that&#39;s not something you want to do every time, unless your mission is obesity. Maybe adding another healthy side would do the trick.

The service and sandwich are still a 10.
The waffle fries are a meh.
The side salad is an 8
But basic satisfaction is a disappointing 4."

Our standard deluxe chicken sandwiches were not huge, but they each had a nice hunk of tasty, tender, real chicken, not reconstituted patties of who-knows-what chicken parts. Even without mayo, the sandwiches were so good, we still didn&#39;t need to add any of the sauce packets we sampled, all of which were good as well. We instead used the sauces as dips for our real potato waffle fries. I say real, because the strings at McD&#39;s for example, taste more like salted cardboard. The cole slaw we had on the side was also enjoyable.

Our very friendly and professional cashier handed us our food almost instantly on the busy evening we visited. Elsewhere, other employees made deliveries to some tables and kept the place clean, while the cow mascot was hard at work entertaining children, stopping by various tables, and dancing with one of the patrons.

It&#39;s a busy, family oriented place with lots of kids around, but it has a friendly, not chaotic, atmosphere.  Frankly, we&#39;re sick of the big chains whose employees and corporate offices could care less about what or how they serve their patrons.

On the plus side, the sandwich was good, as was the nuggets.  Service was quick as well.  The food just didn&#39;t blow me away.  I mean, based on word of mouth and these reviews, you&#39;d think these chickens would fly or something.  I did like their waffle fries though.

It&#39;s still fast food.  Is their chicken sandwich better than Mc D&#39;s, Wendy&#39;s or other joints?  Perhaps.  I don&#39;t really go out of my way for chicken, unless it&#39;s Harolds or Wings.

After 30 minutes we went to check how long our wait was but the hostess said we could just eat at the high top tables. Not sure if they forgot about us or what, because we saw other people being taken back to their seats. 

Our server was very slow and the food took a long time to come out. Their menu was different but funny. It had a lot of sexual innuendo. I had ordered the surf and turf burger and asked for a side for avocado. They charged me $1.50 for it. The burger was soooo good! It came with fries but I didn&#39;t care for it so I just took it in a box to go.

We started off the night with an order of Crispy Mac &amp; Cheese Balls and a Leaded Bananas Foster shake. The combination of cheeses in the balls was just the right saltiness to pair with the shake! The combo of the Meyer&#39;s Dark Rum, Banana, Brown Sugar, &amp; Vanilla Ice Cream in the adult shake was fantastic! Though, it was quite pricey considering it was mostly ice cream.

I had the Garlic Parmesan Butter Burger &amp; White Cheddar Truffle fries. Be prepared for garlic breath with this beast! There are layers of garlic flavor with the garlic parmesan butter and roasted garlic mayo. The burger is stacked high with ingredients that do not disappoint! And those fries! They were the best truffle fries we&#39;ve had thus far!

The boy had the Blissful Bacon Burger. And blissful is was... He&#39;s never had a bacon marmalade that he&#39;s like until this! The addition of the applewood smoked bacon made it even better! And did I mention the truffle fries?!

Especially for the prices.  $9 for an 8 oz Jucy Lucy with a side of standard fries.  This particular burger also comes with a huge amount of fried onion straws and it is on a pretzel bun.  Pretty freaking delicious.  As soon as I cut it in half, the cheese just oozed out like delicious cheesy lava.  If you don&#39;t like messy burgers, that may not be for you.  But I didn&#39;t mind.  It&#39;s cheese, for crying out loud!  The service was also friendly and helpful.  Our server recommended the toasted marshmallow milkshake.  It was very good, but also very rich.  I had to split it with a friend to finish it.

I think I like it here.  Not just the staff, but the clientele.  When a very rude and drunk patron got in a waitress&#39;s face and started yelling at cursing at her, the other customers and staff yelled at him to &#34;Get the hell out of here!&#34;  People of Elgin: You Rule.

Prime comes much closer to great, but from all accounts, can be a bit uneven at times.   I went with the Juicy Lucy, their version of the Minneapolis invention, a hollowed out burger patty with a mess o melted cheese inside.  And it was a mess.

Side of white cheddar truffle fries, I left off the cheese on my order, and they were good.

Complaints?  The Lucy comes stacked on top of onion &#34;straws&#34;, but they were more like rings, pretty massive, and not very crispy.

My lobster mac and cheese also had a weird, almost chemical aftertaste. Even the warm pretzel sticks and dipping sauces were just not very tasty.  My husband enjoyed his burger though.

Burgers made delicious 
Sweet Potato Fries excellent
Onion Strings sinfully good.

Negatives:
Wait Staff well.... They are all dressed lovely. I say this as a sincere compliment. Some of the waitresses are not good at serving. You have to ask for every little obvious thing like napkins, etc.. and there is a long wait for them to come back with what you need. I feel that maybe this is because more of the people who eat there dine on their food vouchers ( rewards), maybe they don&#39;t tip well etc.. I don&#39;t know I am just guessing. When I go in there I feel like saying, I&#39;m spending my money in here instead of the casino. Please give me a waitress who knows how to serve and in exchange I will tip well. Maybe I might try that next time :)

Chicken Wings appetizer. Chicken tasted raw and out of the coop. You know that fowl fresh smell. undercooked.

Salmon with veggies. Salmon needs a better marinade very fowl seafood smell.  Needs better prep.

Bring a sweater if you get cold easily, it has a very cold draft in many seating spots.

I ordered a burger to go it costs me $13.00 and it was wrapped like I went to Wendy&#39;s in foil with fries in a bag. I didn&#39;t spend that amount of money to have it poorly wrapped. Give me a proper container for a to go order."

Unfortunately we came on a Friday night because we couldn&#39;t handle waiting in line for over an hour for the indulge buffet. Prime had plenty of open booths and seating but the service was still incredibly slow. The milkshakes were the first thing we ordered but they didn&#39;t come until well after our appetizers and entrees. Only two of our five ordered drinks or requested waters, the rest had shakes and were left with no drink for most of the meal since the waitress didn&#39;t bother to grab them any water.

They have so many tempting burgers to choose from.  I&#39;ve had several and my faves so far are the Mushroom Burger w/Gruyere cheese &amp; the Thai Chicken Burger.  Yum!  You can build your own burger creation as well choosing from their various burgers, topping and buns. All the burgers come with regular fries (this isn&#39;t clearly stated on the menu as far as I could tell) but you can upgrade for a small charge and get some other great fries like the White Truffle Fries (OMG, these are AMAZING) or the Sweet Potato Fries (very good, but not OMG like the Truffle Fries).

They also have an extensive list of libations with fun names.  Each burger has a cocktail &amp; wine suggestion with it (might have a beer suggestion too, I&#39;m not sure).  I&#39;ve had one of the leaded (alcoholic) milk shakes in the past as well as tried a few cocktails.  One of their fun martinis is plenty for me!

The decor is cool with a modern red, black &amp; white theme...sort of a Jetsons futuristic feel to it. Perhaps a burger joint on Venus?

We took a client there to show off this Vegas style Gourmet burger house we have here in little ole Elgin.

Let me first start off by saying, the service there is always fantastic, That&#39;s never a problem. The issue I had was with the food.  The devil is in the details!!!!

The Asian Chicken Burger was excellent. However, the signature truffle fries were a bit under cooked. If you are going to serve fries with truffle oil, please make the crispy first.  My wife had a custom Kobe beef burger on a pretzel bun with sweet potato fries.  She lucked out, both were fantastic.  I on the other hand had a custom Bison burger with shredded bacon and provolone, on Ciabatta roll with onion strings.  My burger was cooked perfectly, but the bun wasn&#39;t toasted, so the bottom was soggy and non-existent. The onion stings were also under cooked and disgusting.  I really wanted to enjoy it, but I just couldn&#39;t.

At the end of the day, I didn&#39;t want to say anything in front of our client, because he thoroughly enjoyed his Asian burger and was OK with the truffle fries.

I will go back tomorrow (being Sunday) and tell them of my experience, so that my food is made exactly the way I expect it should be,"

Obviously, we were pleasantly surprised when we received the bill. My boyfriend had a stuffed burger that was full of American cheese and topped with onion rings. It was super messy, but if gooey cheese is your thing, it looked good. I chose the &#34;build your own section.&#34; I went for the pretzel bread, avocado and bbq sauce on a beef burger. It was not too shabby. My only issue was that the bread tasted a little old and the burger had a weird, almost gas like taste. Our server was very friendly and attentive."

I like the fact that you have a large variety of build your own burger, they even have salmon and Kobe beef (not sure how &#34;pure&#34; it is but I will say the Kobe beef patty at only $2 more than the sirloin burger is damn well worth it if you&#39;re a carnivore).  They cook the burgers to your liking and there&#39;s 2 methods of making them flat top or on the grill (don&#39;t worry the staff will ask you).  

However, what I last ordered blew my mind and made me select 5 STARS - the Lobster Grilled Cheese.  Let me make the mental image for you - Thick Texas toast, cheddar cheeses, and what seems like endless chunks of lobster meat! meat! 

Beer, Wine, and Cocktails are all good.  The even have Blue Label so that&#39;s always nice to see.

Lastly, I&#39;d recommend ponying up extra money for truffle fries or sweet potato fries as the sandwiches/burgers come standard but upgrade you&#39;ll be glad you did."

There were plenty of empty clean tables, no need to make the customer wait while 4 people figure out how to arrange two tables for a party of 8.  Perhaps they simply cannot handle a crowd.  We did go at 3:30 on Mother&#39;s Day, so it was busy.  However, they always had open tables, so it could have been busier.  I don&#39;t believe I would rush back anytime soon... Or at all.

Hope you like french fries or onion strips, because you are not able to get any other non-fried side item included with the price of your meal.  They have wine flights, so this is good.  The space is cool and comfortable.  I don&#39;t like the obnoxious sparkly red uniforms, not exactly your picture of modesty and seem to fit poorly (after all these people are on the clock and don&#39;t have a choice).

My first experience was a 4 star, my last experience, described below, was a 2 star:  

The summary version is that I ordered a well done cheddar bacon burger and said that I had only 30 minutes to eat &amp; pay.  The burger was served at the incorrect temperature and without bacon, the waitress didn&#39;t check back, but I had to eat the food anyway due to time constraints.

The server finally checked in when I had already paid and had my coat on to see how it was, then argued and told me that it did have bacon.  Well in a burger only restaurant, I want my burger cooked the way I like it and I want bacon on my bacon burger."

You can change the channel on the tv but all it had was all stations football yuck :) So we just turned the volume all the way down.  The menu has a bunch of sections. Everything from a basic burger to one with a lobster on it.  For lunch I ordered the Juicy Louise and paid the extra dollar to upgrade to steak fries. My burger was cooked to perfection. It came with onion rings on it which I took off because they just made the burger too big for my mouth. It was like having two different sides :) The Juicy Louise here is the closest I have had to Matt&#39;s bar in Minneapolis (still the best in my opinion). My burger was served with a generous portion of fresh steak fries also. One of the best burger spots in the Chicago Area. Would defiantly go back!!!

Every time I come here, I am totally convinced that it will be the day that I can replicate Kuma&#39;s Metallica burger or at least make the World&#39;s Greatest Burger EVER part deux.  I usually get close.  Even if you don&#39;t like BYOB (burger style) there are a lot of other pre-made options that are sure to rock.  I like that there are different meat options (a couple of different beef options, buffalo, turkey, chicken, etc.) and there are a lot of fancy ass sauces and mayos to add on too.  The fries are decent, although I wish that the sweet potato ones or the truffle ones would have blown my mind, alas, they did not.  There are also pretty good shakes here (some with booze...yeah, boyeeeee.) that can top off your lunch or dinner.
The booths are crazy big and comfy and there are several with their own t.v.s so you can watch whatever the hell you want if you are picky like that.    
My only real complaint is that there are only a couple of really good craft beer options and it is in the boat.  If you are a gambler then this is a plus for you, especially if you have comps...but if you have a husband who can play craps for days straight after eating there, not so much.

First we take a look at their beers. They could have better choices when it comes to imports. I was going to have a Stella on tap. Nope, they were out. Ok we&#39;ll just have a Coke. When they came, they were flat. Finally flag down the waitress to let her know and ask for water instead. We also ordered the Onion Strings. They were ok. It&#39;s tough to mess up fried onions. They were served with runny ranch dressing and ketchup. Plain was better.

I ordered the surf and turf burger because I love lobster and I had one once in Vegas and loved it. Yeah, this one, I did not love. The lobster tail was raw. Flag down the manager and let her know. She looks at it and says it sure is and takes it back to the kitchen. She comes back explaining that he grabbed it our of the wrong pot..blah blah blah. I don&#39;t really care how it happened. It shouldn&#39;t have happened. She tells us she&#39;s taking it off the bill. Good thing because the replacement was overcooked. Can&#39;t find a happy medium?

Luckily his burger was fine. He ordered the Drunken Bull Burger. He says, it had prosciutto  and it was delicious. Glad he enjoyed his. I guess he and our friend can go there again. I wouldn&#39;t bother."

Yes, they are expensive, but if you know that ahead of time and are willing to pay the price, then don&#39;t complain.  I would estimate that they have 15 speciality burgers, and the menu also recommends specific drinks (alcoholic and non) as well as shakes that pair best with the burger.  I thought that was a cool feature that most places don&#39;t have.  Personally, I love the fact that you can customize your own burger.  Choice of Buns, Cheeses, Burger type (Hamburger, Kobe Burger, Chicken breast, turkey burger, plus some more), toppings, sauces.  So many combinations that you could come up with.  Little doubt in my mind that you could make your favorite combination and be pleased with the burger.  I also like the fact that they will cook the patty either flame broiled or griddle seared (aka Burger King vs McDonald&#39;s).  Shakes are amazing here as well.

I have never had an issue with the service.  Most of the time it is very good.  Some times it has just been average, but it has never been bad.  Atmosphere here excels.  Love the tiling they used on the floor, and the booths are pretty cool looking.  Very comfortable, chic vibe going on.

If you are in the area, and looking for a really good burger, go ahead and check it out.  Just be prepared that it isn&#39;t going to be cheap."

We went our for my husbands birthday, and there were six of us.  Our server, Jill, was an absolute gem, and she was so helpful.  A bunch of us did the build-your-own-burger option, so we were kinda high maintenance, and she was very roll-with-the-flow about it.  She even teased us about it, and I appreciate a waitress with a sense of humor!

We started with drinks--my friends got beer, and mixed drinks.  I tried their flight of three martinis for $12.  TOTALLY worth the value.  These babies are NOT small and they are SO, SO strong.  So if you&#39;re the DD, or you actually want to be coherant while playing in the casino, you might want to skips ordering one of these babies.

But anyway, the food was DELICIOUS!  The macaroni and cheese balls were really, really good, but my personal favorite of the night was the chili cheese fries I was able to upgrade to with my burger.  They were phenomenal, and they hit the spot.  Everyone else was raving about their burgers, too.  The Kobe beef is outstanding!

The food was great. We had the mac and cheese things to start and they were super good. I ordered the garlic burger and my boyfriend ordered the Kobe. We both really really liked our burgers. We didn&#39;t get the special fries because we didn&#39;t even know about them until we already had placed our order. But we saw some other people that got them and they looked pretty yummy. For what you get, its well worth the price. The atmosphere is cool and pretty laid back. Good place to grab a drink if you are getting ready to go lose some money in the casino.
If the service was better it would have gotten 5 stars."

We went on a Saturday night and were immediately seated. Basically, if I wasn&#39;t on a strict diet right now, I would probably eat here 7 days a week -- the food here is that good. You have your choice of meats--beef, kobe beef, salmon, turkey, etc. and your choice of buns, toppings, fries, etc.  So I got a beef burger with BBQ sauce and boy was it good! The fries are really good as well. My wife had a lobster grilled cheese and she loved it.  They have complimentary potato chips that are really good as well. I was tempted to try a milkshake, but that would definitely exceed my calorie limit for the day.  Plus, they are very reasonably priced (avg $10 per burger) and the service is really good. 

If you bring in a movie ticket stub from a local theater, you get $10.00 off your order which is nice. Just take your ticket stub to the player&#39;s club in the casino to get it validated."

Our waitress was very friendly and interactive with the table.  She got all of our orders correct, which we all were very please about.  The interior of the restaurant was modern retro look, which was pleasing.  The chairs that we sat on were very comfy.  We shared Mac and Cheese ball which were fried.  The exterior had a nice crunch to them and the interior was very cheesy.  It was mac and cheese heaven on a plate.  I ordered the Drunken Bull Burger medium rare, but when it came out to me it was well done.  This burger also had blue cheese, which I&#39;m not a fan of.  So I was able to sub it out with pepper jack.  The burger was very juicy and well season, something you expect from a burger house.  I ordered a side of steak fries, which were typical steak fries you can get anywhere else.  I didn&#39;t finish eating them because the burger was very filling.  One of my friends ordered a milk shake while he had his meal.  So I was craving one for dessert, but they were really big shakes.  We asked our waitress we were able to split it into 2 separate cups.  She told us it was not a problem.  My friend and I ordered the creme brûlée shake which we split.  I was very good and it didn&#39;t last too long in our separate cups.  The reason I&#39;m giving this 4.5 stars is because my burger didn&#39;t come out the way I ordered it and the steak fries.  But over all great atmosphere and it&#39;s a good place to go to end the weekend.  Oh and if you are brave enough, enter into the casino for some extra fun!"

Prime is located on the Grand Victoria casino boat, to your left, as you walk up the entrance ramp.  So why not stop in for some drinks to either A) lesson the later blow on your loss  B)help you make some &#34;sound&#34; decisions on which machines to use

Drinks are very reasonably priced.  Birthday girl had the martini flight...which were too strong for her....Her loss is my gain! You can choose from 4 different martinis, for a 3 martini flight, all of them a very good portion.  I had the coffee martini, very good as well.

It is a very trendy place, lots of circles in the decorations. One of the best parts about the atmosphere is the diner now has an option to watch TV at their table. You have an option of about three channels but that is more than most places let you choose. 

The food was great! My husband and I both got the build your own burgers with skinny fries. The fries are good and come with so many options. You can get steak fries, white truffle, cheese, sweet potato, chili cheese, or the plain skinny ones which we got. The burger was perfect. I ordered it medium and it came out medium and smelling so good. 

The shakes were also amazing. We tasted the Creamsicle and Creme Brulee. I would recommend trying both of them and maybe even being a little adventurous and trying one of their Leaded shakes (alcohol) 

Service was great. Our drinks never reached half empty before our server was over filling them back up. Ordering, cooking, and eating it took 45 minutes total so perfect for lunch hours. We will definitely be back!"

That&#39;s where the upside ends. My girlfriend and I waited for sometime to get a table and were eventually seated, I ordered a beer which they were out of (they only have 4 taps, that hard to stay in stock?) and there seemed to warrant a long discussion about trying to get a different one. After about 20 minutes, our waitress came back with my drink and took our food order. 

I ordered the Prairie Fire Buffalo Burger with the White Truffle Fries, and the significant other got the Thai Chicken Burger. After about 30 minutes we got our food. I should have taken a picture of my brown and light green mound of food. Both of our meals were absolutely terrible. Both burgers were #1 and #2 as the worst burgers I have ever put past my lips. The ground chicken patty was inedible, with a texture and taste worse than gas station chicken nuggets. White Truffle at prime is code for Parmesan cheese and parsley. 

Not only this, When our meals were served, my girlfriend decided to get one of their iced down $12 &#34;cocktails&#34;. After sometime had passed, I had heard the bartender complaining that no one had picked up this drink and that he was not going to make it again. I got up, picked up the watery and warm drink myself and brought it to the table. 

After over an hour of not seeing my waitress to get another drink, a napkin for my grease sponge of a burger or even to check on us, I had to walk over to the hostess stand to find a manager and waited another fifteen minutes to talk to him, he disappeared again to see what he could do for us, which turned out to be nothing. What a shock, waiting for nothing at Prime. 

I spent nearly 3 hours at prime to see my waitress once to order food.  She was from Russia but she sure wasn&#39;t rushin&#39;.   They had commented they were very busy and sorry they couldn&#39;t have had better service. Yet, including my table, there were six total tables. There were four waitresses, a hostess, two managers, six people in the kitchen and two bartenders and still got no help. 

I had a $50 check for 2 burgers and 2 drinks and 3 hours of my life forever wasted in this pit of despair. 

Prime is a fantastic concept with awful execution, don&#39;t go unless you like wasting your money, and more importantly your time."

The service was really attentive and the bartender knew what a &#34;highball&#34; was (whiskey and ginger ale). Food was great, burgers cooked just the way I like them (medium rare) and I loved the skinny fries. My companion got the onion strings and gave them a thumbs down. We also had the chocolate molten cake for dessert...next time I&#39;m saving room for a shake

Not a huge fan of the uniforms they make the servers wear, but I understand it&#39;s going along with the concept of the restaurant and decor.

But I&#39;ve been eating the Garlic Parmesean Butter burger....and that is &#34;my&#34; burger.  It&#39;s so F-in good.  Anywho...truffle fries changed...they cover the fries with white cheddar &#34;shavings&#34; but quite honestly, the old way was WAY better.  I&#39;m disappointed that they did this.  The white cheddar over powers the truffle, so there is no point in paying extra for truffle fries if you can&#39;t taste truffle. Booo Prime, bring my fries back!"
prime-burgerhouse-elgin,Irene Z.,P1ttJQl6pdfSGUa9V4o-6g,"Elk Grove Village, IL",0,1,0,71,24,EkfK5VYVe8HIhu_vIoFXbg,1.0,2011-02-06,"I&#39;m giving this one star, and it&#39;s on the basis that I did not get the opportunity to try the food here because the customer service is beyond awful.

Granted, the day we came was Wednesday following the blizzard, but if I&#39;m not mistaken, customer service should be first priority for a restaurant, blizzard or not.  If you&#39;re open, it&#39;s because you can cater to your customers, correct?

Prior to arriving, we called the casino to confirm they were open and in operation. We had originally wanted to go to the buffet and were told that it was open, but of course, when we arrived (after a 40 minute drive), the buffet was closed. So...after making a phone call to the casino switchboard to let them know they gave us wrong info (and receiving an &#39;oh well, not our problem&#39; attitude), we went to Prime.  We waited 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us...mind you, this was in clear view of the bartender who saw us standing &amp; waiting there and did nothing to flag down a host or any waitstaff.  When the host finally greeted us, he gestured toward the bar and the 5 tables they had decided to open, told us they were too full for our party...and to go to the Deli next door.

We left, but then decided to try carry out.  If we couldn&#39;t eat there, well then maybe we could get some warm burgers and take them home, or eat in the lobby (ha).  So, we went back, attempted to flag the bartender down, and after 10 or so minutes (and after he was done just chit chatting with people), he came over.  We asked if we could do carryout and he disdainfully told us that there was only one burger available for us to carry out and that if we wanted to do that, we&#39;d have to wait a while.

We were, however, not the only party to be turned away...which made me feel better, but at the same time solidifies my low opinion of the service here...why turn away business when you can open up more tables??  So we, like the 12 or so other people who were turned away, stood in line at the Deli to attempt to get something to eat.

We&#39;ve been coming to Grand Victoria over the years for the buffet, Fox n Hounds (previously what Prime was), and the casino itself, and it has rapidly deteriorated in customer service and in its offerings.

In my opinion, don&#39;t attempt to go to Prime unless you&#39;re already at the riverboat to play.  Sad I can&#39;t judge the food, but I can definitely say not worth the drive just to possibly have to encounter the same host or bartender we had to.

I hear that Des Plaines casino opening this summer will be amazing.  Perhaps when Grand Victoria starts losing business to this casino, they will revisit their customer service policies and cater to their patrons the way they used to."

Revising my original review (above) because I have given this place a second chance and everything was much better. So I&#39;ll upgrade from one star to two. And if it&#39;s good again, it will go to three or more. The thing is that other reviews show that the Prime BurgerHouse varies a lot, depending on the night. So you take your chances. Ideally, it&#39;s good more often than not, but I&#39;m not sure."

I had heard a lot about it from people and the prices did not seem bad, so we gave it a try. Im really glad we did!!! We ended up getting a table about 8:30pm and they asked if we wanted a booth or a table, and that the booths had tvs on them. Of course I picked the booth with the tv so we could watch the Hawks game that was starting soon!! I loved the decor of the restaurant, very modern...we felt like we were sitting in IKEA and LOVED everything about it(I mean my friend wanted to ask the waitress if they would sell thier salt and pepper shakers)
 Our waitress came by and took our drink order, We ordered a coors, magic hat and then my one friend ordered the loaded creamsicle. The creamsicle was outstanding, but I could see that they would be verrrry dangerous because you could not even taste any alcohol in it!!
for dinner I ordered the build-your-own-burger with a turkey patty on a pretzel roll. It came with fries but for a dollar more I added cheese to my fries. This turkey burger was the biggest Ive ever seen and it was only 9 bucks!!! It had a ton of flavor and was cooked just right, and being on a pretzel bun made it even better!! the fries were crispy and loaded with the cheese sauce, I recommend spending the extra dollar on the cheese!!

If I could do a 1/2 star, I&#39;d say 3 1/2 but I&#39;d rather go with 4 than 3 not having that option. Had a jumbo shrimp appitizer, buffalo burger, side salad and martini which, with tax, came to about $40. Add tip, $50ish. 

I prefer the buffalo burger at Emmett&#39;s Tavern in West Dundee but Prime&#39;s is OK. You get fries with your order or pay and extra $1 for a variety of sides, including a salad. Side sald was a little bland, the blue cheese dressing didn&#39;t have any zing either but the greens were fresh. The shrimp had a little too much of an oder / taste that gave it a bit of an aged/frozen and thawed sensation. I have to accomodate for the fact that we&#39;re no where near the ocean but even given that room for play on points, it wasn&#39;t great, even though the texture was good. (Not over or under cooked.) Maybe if they put a tinge of lemon to get rid of the less than freshness? 

Will I go back? Maybe. Value for money spent is debatable but, if I go for the wings rather than the shrimp and coke rather than Belvedere vodka it may tip the scale. as the price would come down.

Is it for kids? Probably not, it has a Casino feel and there are other more kid atmostphere friendly spots. My favorite family friendly in that area is Villa Verona."

They have a ton of different burger options as well as a build your own burger option and the prices start at around $11 and go up from there. All burger meals come with fries as well. The portions aren&#39;t overwhelmingly huge so there was nothing to take home for later which in this case I was totally fine with because it is located inside the casino and we where going to gamble afterwards and I didn&#39;t want to lug anything around with me. The decor is very trendy/retro, all red/black/white and lots of circles. The service was good but our waitress in particular wasn&#39;t the best.

We have been wanting to go to this place ever since it opened because of its neat concept with &#34;high-end&#34; burgers.  Yet on a Thursday night, with absolutely very limited business in the restaurant, it took us about 2 hours to eat in this place.  

We waited at least 45 minutes to get our food which included our appetizer!  

Now our server Brittany, is an excellent waitress who offered great recommendations for our dining.  But unfortunately, the problem was the help in the kitchen and the fact that we think we may have seen a manager of the restaurant, but nobody besides our waitress came around to check on us.  In my opinion, if you are trying to get people into your restaurant, you definitely don&#39;t want them to wait about 2 hours while they could be gambling at the casino!  

Brittany explained that the restaurant is having some growing issues and we definitely experienced that last night.  My prime-burger was ratre when I ordered it medium well.  The kobe burger was tender but also undercooked too.  The side of guacamole that I requested came &#34;brown&#34; but Brittany did replace it almost immediately when it was pointed out.

On a separate side note, how could a bartender with 10 seconds left in a NCAA game, change the channel when customers are watching the TV when the game is going to be decided in the final seconds???  But I digress.

Eventually, we will come back to this restaurant to give it another shot because there is a need for it.  But unless some TLC is put into this place (besides from the hostess and wait staff), this place will not be as excellent as it could be."

It&#39;s fun, unpretentious, and unique with hip drinks, alcoholic Milkshakes, provocatively dressed servers, and over-the-top burgers made of only the absolute finest ingredients. 

Despite it&#39;s riverboat casino location, I really just love the concept of this place! Maybe because it&#39;s so different than the norm or that they try to take casual classic American dishes nearly everyone loves and spare no expense in making them as best as possible ...or perhaps its all the subtle sexual innuendos steering the vibe to a more saucy and risqué adult feel (subtle enough to still be good for kids at least during reasonable hours). I don&#39;t know but I&#39;m definitely a fan. 

If you go, know whatever you order it will be over-the-top! They have at least six types of fries. 13 or more types of alcoholic (leaded) and non-alcoholic (unleaded) milkshakes that come in glasses that must be at least a foot tall and with a mammoth straw to suck it down. Every burger on the menu is a complex creation such as the Drunken Bull (from their menu... a Kobe Burger with Sauteed Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, Crispy Prosciutto, May Tag Blue Cheese Cabernet Reduction on Grilled Pretzel Bun). Never fear, if you like your burgers simple or just want to make your own ultra burger creation, the build-your-own menu (only shown in the Magazine Menu) is beyond words and virtually allows you to build any burger you want and I do mean virtually ANY burger! The menu doesn&#39;t even show all the options of which I count 6 patty types, 7 different buns, 4 versions of the standard condiments, 8 cheeses, 8 sauces, 4 dressings, and at least 12 additional toppings. The meat is ground fresh daily on their on site butchery and no worries about your religious beliefs on charbroiling vs flat top grilling; it&#39;s your choice. 

Like I said, I really love the concept of this place. So why only the three stars? Well, I&#39;ve been here three times and they have yet to cook the meat as ordered ...even upon sending it back! I mean really...if your ENTIRE concept is centered around high-end burgers a basic element of that is being able to cook &#39;em right! PLEASE... I asked for rare+ and got well-done! Funny, as that was on the re-order, the original came out medium! Management did graciously take it off my bill but I personally would have been much more interested in just getting any awesome burger the way I wanted it. 

Still, I will try Prime again and if you&#39;re OK with the riverboat casino scene and all that goes with it, I would recommend you try this place out; at least once if nothing else just for the experience. 

If you do go and create your own personal ultimate burger, send a note or message with your bad-a__ creation and let me know how it was. And don&#39;t forget the name ...you know every legendary burger has one!"

Prime is a classy burger bar located in GV Casino; the decor is striking and modern, in shimmery red and black.  I was greeted by not one, but three hostesses who sat our group of six in a huge booth.  The seating is comfortable and spacious.

Rather than writing a lengthy review, I will just list my thoughts.

Positive-
The food is great!  There are hundreds of possible combinations with all the options to build your own burger.
Waitstaff was very friendly 
Classy decor
Great seating
Prices are reasonable

Negative-
Drinks took 20 minutes to arrive
Appetizers took another 10 minutes (30 total)
Food took another 25 minutes (waited nearly an hour for a cheeseburger)
Neither waitress or supervisor were able to split the check properly


Conclusion-
With great food and caring staff, Prime will be a great place once they get the routine down.  Gambler or not, if you are looking for a great burger consider going to Prime.  Just wait a few months before you go."

My entree was the surf and turf burger that was possibly the best hamburger I have ever eaten. The Lobster tail was very fresh (i ate that seperate from the burger) Comes with a melted butter cup and a side of fries or fresh veg&#39;s. The burger was very tasty and done just right (medium) Very friendly staff and IMO very decent pricing. Pretty good beer selection, only wish they had a few more offerings like Three Floyds Alpha King, Surly Furious and Dogfish head on tap. I will definitely be back to try another burger. Burgerhouse is way, way better than burgerbar in vegas."

This is a really nice place to enjoy a gourmet burger.  They have several &#34;styles&#34; of burgers to choose from or you can create your own.  There are tons of possibilities with many types of buns, meat and toppings, you could eat here every day for a month and never have the same burger twice.  Our server was very nice, friendly, smiling, what a nice change from so many places.  The decor is upscale diner and it&#39;s spotless.  Here&#39;s a tip, you can usually find a coupon for $10 off online so look for that.  But even without the coupon, it&#39;s worth the money.  There aren&#39;t many other choices beside burgers, chicken sandwiches and salads for main courses but with so many preparation variations, it really doesn&#39;t matter  Like another reviewer, I kind of wish it was on it&#39;s own, not part of the casino scene, but what the heck, it keeps the crowds down."

The service was excellent, when I went there on a wednesday afternoon.  Overall it is a very friendly atmosphere, and the restaurant itself was clean, bright, and very modern.  For the little extra in price, the experience was worth it.  There is plenty of parking in the parking garage, or valet parking right in front of the main door.  Basically you enter the Grand Victoria main building, and the restaurant was within a short walking distance.  Will definately go again."

Based on one review here is my bottom line comment.  DON&#39;T HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS.  I only went in because most people on Yelp recommend this place highly, and I stopped in at the Village Offices and they recommended Wee Dee&#39;s, so I thought it must be delicious. 

FOOD COMMENTS: The pita bread was outstanding and honestly, it was a good value as a basic meal without fries or drink.  But for my taste, there was too much salt and too much grease used to heat the chicken. My chicken pita was good.  I would stop in again, if I was desperate, but I would ask them to fry my chicken dry without oil and I would take it to go.

GENERAL COMMENTS: It&#39;s basically a tiny corner hot dog stand kind of place with seating for roughly 16-20 patrons. When I say greasy I mean windows, door handles, surfaces, and the food.  I won&#39;t go into detail about the interior decor and state of cleanliness, but let&#39;s just say this place would benefit  from a deep cleaning and a woman&#39;s touch."

Service:
Ridiculously fast. Faster than any drive thru fast! I didn&#39;t order precooked items either. 

Atmosphere:
This place feels like the setting for a haunted fast food place in the middle of a forgotten part of the city lol. It has creepy clocks and an old school dining area. Not to mention the bathroom is unsettling. Flickering lights, weird humming noise, cracked tiles, and the slightly faulty faucet. Don&#39;t take a gal here. This is one of those places where you go to eat and be content with the fatty foods you just ate. 

Food:
The speed of how fast the food came out made me a tad worried, but everything came out presented well and the taste did not disappoint. And the price for quality and quantity is phenomenal! Seriously, the gut bursting amount of food you get for under $10 is cray cray. I am most impressed at how crispy and clean cut their fries are. Their Double Pizza Burger was the Greasy Goodness. It wasn&#39;t overly greasy, but it was packed with flavor. The quality of beef on that burger tasted well above the price I paid for it. I did not really enjoy the Hot Dogs, but I am not a big Hot Dog guy regardless. Their Hot Dogs are loaded with toppings like Chicago Hot Dogs.

I will drop by again if I am in the area. Just beware of the creepy bathroom! A shabby Fast Food place with a crazy amount of menu items that I hope to try one day."

so I stopped in here and got me a Gyro and Fries and a small soda think it was around $6 that not bad for lunch, and the Gyro was yummy and the fries were fresh and hot, and as my BF pointed out the other day we have not had bad fries here I don&#39;t know what it is but we always got bad fries in Seattle, plus I love all the places that have fresh cut fries here 

went back a couple days ago and had the Maxwell Street Polish, it was flame grilled to a nice crispy goodness and they put all the topping on it, just like a Chicago Dog oh so good

Hopefully things will turn around.. but it will be some time before I check. To their credit the staff is very nice in person and on the phone."

That being said I had not been in a really long time. On Wed. March 9, 2012 I went to a presentation at Crystal River Gifts just up the road and bumped into some friends. Afterwords we wanted to go somewhere to sit and talk and we ended up at Wee Dee&#39;s just before they closed at 9PM. We asked if we could still come in and order something and hang out till they were done cleaning up and ready to close. They were really nice and allowed us to do just that. Even though it was pretty late I ordered the gyros plate with everything except the pita as I am no longer eating any wheat. The meat was cooked &amp; seasoned perfectly, the tzatziki sauce is definitely homemade."

Joe is an amazing server that literally does it all. He waits on every table, answers the phones, and rings people up. I&#39;m surprised he doesn&#39;t do the delivery orders too! He&#39;s tremendously friendly and a joy to be around. If you go around dinner and it gets busy, have patience. He takes care of everyone in the restaurant, and the food is totally worth it. 

I love supporting Green Jade and will continue to do so as long as I&#39;m in the area. Great, high quality food, and a really friendly, family owned restaurant. 

Joe is the man!"

We figured that there had to be something at least somewhat fresh...everything looked like it had been sitting there for at least a half an hour. I get it, it wasn&#39;t prime lunch time but there was still a good 5 people there and not once while we were there did anything get freshened up or replaced. They were out of the green beans, egg drop soup, and two of the main dishes when we arrived that we never got to try.  
Very disappointing. 
Not to mention there was one of the owners or employees giving another person a back massage on the booth behind us...very awkward and unprofessional.
Our server was friendly but disappeared to the back most of the time we were there :/ 
Wouldn&#39;t recommend."

I went here on my lunch break for something quick and cheap and got exactly that from their buffet. I can&#39;t say it was the most expansive of Chinese buffets I&#39;ve been to but it got the job done. 

I enjoyed the eggrolls (I had 3 of them); they were made with the crispier thinner rice paper instead of a wanton wrapper like so many other Chinese restaurants use. This resulted in a lightly lighter eggroll that promoted more of the flavor of the filling which was enjoyable. I would advise, however, to stay away from the &#34;spicy&#34; mustard; there was so much horseradish in the mustard it ruined pretty much everything it touched. I also had the fried rice, which really wasn&#39;t special in any way; it&#39;s pretty hard to make a bad fried rice. I will say that the texture of the rice was nice a fluffy, not overly starchy, sticky, or mushy, so kudos to that. I also sampled the vegetable lo mien which was filling. The flavor of the lo mien was mediocre but it also had a potent underlying garlic flavor that was overpowering and I will most likely be tasting it for the remainder of the day. As for the protein dishes, I tried the sesame chicken and the kung-pow beef. Both items were tasty and the texture was not unappealing. The chicken was liberally sauced and sprinkled with a lot of sesame seeds, however, did seem sticky and it kind of clumped together but I wasn&#39;t using my hands to eat it so it didn&#39;t matter. When I was at the buffet line, it seemed like someone had stood there and picked most of the beef out of the kung-pow beef (not the restaurant&#39;s fault); luckily there were still some pieces of beef and lots of tasty mushrooms. 

The restaurant itself was clean, relatively quiet for lunch time, but I&#39;m not complaining, though I will complain about the guy at the next table that slurped and burped everything he got from the buffet... gross (again, not the restaurant&#39;s fault). The server was quick and friendly which was impressive considering he seemed to be the only one there and helped those of us dining in but also the customers who were there for carry out. 

This place delivered exactly what I needed, quick and inexpensive food. By no means is this a fancy place; It&#39;s not the best Chinese and it&#39;s not the worst, it falls somewhere in the middle as far as quality is concerned and in some instances mediocrity is okay. I would come here before I go to a Panda Express, but that&#39;s not saying much. Will I come here again, yes; will I eat my fill and be happy with my decision, probably; would I suggest this place to others, yes. Over all, I&#39;d give it 3  1/2 stars."

I&#39;m on a look out for a good Chinese restaurant, so I stopped by to take a look inside and get the menu.  The guy behind the register was busy ringing up customers, but all I wanted was a take out menu.  I reached for a menu that was sitting on top of the counter. I happened to accidentally knock down a knicknack that was sitting there on top of the menu.  The guy at the register scowled at me and frankly was rude like he thought I was an elephant in a china shop.  Even though the restaurant was full and the menu looks interesting, I&#39;m not coming back.  I don&#39;t feel like I want to be bothered with a rude help."

Like same sauce. You would close your eyes and you couldn&#39;t tell the difference. And worst thing is that neither of them tasted like it was supposed to. Just blah. Then when I point this out I got a really really bad attitude from the waiter (who was not Chinese). I would avoid this place at all costs.

This review is based strictly on the lunch buffet. First off,  the hot and sour soup was delicious! Unfortunatley, with the exception of the iced tea and fortune cookie that&#39;s it.

 As far as the other items on the buffet i wouldnt touch unless i was homeless and starving. The meat was unidentifiable on every section of the buffet. I tried the sweet and sour pork cut it in 1/2 and the meat was a dark, off colored meat that was texturaly disgusting. The egg rolls are different and not bad but definitely had better. There was something not right about the meat on this buffet.

In addition, the owner of the place seemed to be the only one working at this time and he was talking to a couple of customers he must have known and they were talking and laughing about cats and cat food and the 2 customers talking how they will be shitting on the toilet the rest of the afternoon and the owner laughing. If you own a asian based restaurant  that is a word that should never be mentioned in your establishment no matter what the conversation is about (iam talking about the word cat).

I would not go back. If some one insisted they try it i would walk to one of the fast food places around the corner."

Food:
Crab Rangoon - heavy on the cream cheese, but smooth and mild flavored. Very good. Pair it with their awesome sweet &amp; sour sauce and they&#39;re heavenly.

Sweet &amp; Sour sauce - not super thick or super cloying like a red colored syrup. Very good.

Shrimp fried rice - huge portion, but mild in flavor. Expect a healthy amount of quarter size shrimp! Might need something to punch up the flavoring here.

Chicken with cashew - tender, delicious chicken in a fabulous brown sauce. Good ratio of veggies to chicken. Crispy orange bell peppers &amp; crunchy cashews.

Curry chicken - yellow curry, mild heat and a bit sweet. Lots of onion chunks, FYI.

Over all : I loved the place. My favorite was the chicken cashew. Next time I&#39;m skipping the shrimp fried rice and trying the chicken or veggie fried rice. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the spicy mustard. It is way overpowered by horseradish and has a weird aftertaste like whatever they store it in. You&#39;ll know what I mean if you try it by itself. I&#39;ll definitely come here again and I&#39;m bringing friends. Also, it&#39;s 8 minutes away from me. Huge plus!!! If they&#39;d start delivering, I&#39;d be ordering from them every night."

The &#34;manager&#34; called back, but only to try to prove me wrong saying, &#34;just open the box and look.&#34; We over-payed, did not receive a refund for the food we ordered but did not receive, and the food we did get was sub-par at best.

The only edible item was the Crab Rangoon (almost impossible to mess that up) but even then, they were &#34;just OK.&#34;

The Pot Stickers were little ball bearings of dense meat wrapped in a gummy dumpling dough.  They didn&#39;t even do a good job of searing the pot stickers and the filling was dense and flavorless.

The Orange Chicken was overly sweet and didn&#39;t have any of the spicy component that one expects with the sauce for this dish.

Quick &amp; easy, and  based on the amount of take-out business they were doing as well as already having several tables dining at 6 p.m. on a weeknight I&#39;d say they are a popular place.

We tried the Crab Rangoon, the fried Potstickers &amp; the Happy Family dish.  Everything was very good.  The Potstickers were fat with meat filling &amp; the veggies &amp; various meats in the Happy Family were plentiful.

They were a bit stingy with the sauce packets however, just one spicy mustard, 2 sweet &amp; sour &amp; 2 soy sauce packets.  It seems most Chinese places either give you way too many or not nearly enough of these.  Oh, and if you only order 1 entree you are only getting 1 fortune cookie.  Really?

Its not as if I grew up on Chinese food and must hold it to insanely high standards. Nope, I grew up on hamburger helper and kool aid. Outside of Chinatown, I&#39;m simply not a fan of most Chinese restaurants in Chicago. That is what makes my love of a strip mall Chinese restaurant in Elgin out of the norm.

Green Jade has won me over  for several reasons. The food is really good without being incredibly greasy. The menu is diverse and pretty strong all around, so the chicken dishes are just as good as the seafood ones. Green Jade also recognizes that quantity can not make me overlook quality. So many restaurants, not just Chinese , give me a ton of their mediocre food and it seems like a good deal for the price. No, that is not a good deal. A good deal is when you give me normal person sized portions of a quality meal, and that is where Green Jade shines. I definitely recommend eating here should you find yourself hankering for Chinese food in Elgin."

The buffet is very well priced and while the spread is on the smaller side the choices are all very varied and worth the money. As for the rest of their food everything I&#39;ve had has been delicious though the bubble tea is not great; their rice is never old and the food is always piping hot with their orange chicken being particularly crispy and delicious. The last time I ordered it it was still sizzling when they brought it to my table!
Now for the downside... While the food and service is fantastic when eating in (sit at a table, the booths are really cramped) or carrying out I have to admit that my experience with their delivery has been nothing but disastrous. The delivery driver arrived almost two hours after I had ordered (with the estimated time being an hour) and left quickly before we checked the bags and discovered that it wasn&#39;t even our order. Another forty-five minutes later the driver returned and apologized, handing over the correct order. He then asked for the incorrect one, which at first I didn&#39;t think was all that strange (note: we had already opened the containers to check their contents but hadn&#39;t eaten any of it) but then he started re-stapling and bagging the food in front of us! He even asked for the incorrect reciept back so he could still deliver it! 
I&#39;d definitely go back to eat in, but I&#39;ll never trust them for delivery again."

After reading &#34;best chinese food in elgin&#34; i thought id give it a try. It was so disgusting. Not to mention the service sucked. I got delivery, not only did it take an hour and a half, but i had to wait at the door for the guy to call and see how much it was. I got there version of general tsos chicken, when i opened it up, i knew it didnt look right and it was downright awful!!!!! Got my daughter the egg foo young, cause she loved it when she tried it somewhere else. She took one bite and right away said it was bad. 

The egg foo young was litterally an egg patty with all the vegtables placed on top...the sauce for it was bad. The egg patty was bad. The vegtables were bad. 

The fried rice was tasteless just like there egg rolls. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. I have never had chinese food that i didnt like. This chinese food is currently sitting in my fridge waiting for garbage day, with only a few gag eating bites taken out of it. I might just have to get really drunk to try and down this, cause it really does suck having to waste 30 bucks on crap. 

Best part of our lunch was the cans of coke, WHICH they FORGOT to put in the bag and the delivery guy had to go to 7-11 to buy. This place is a joke. They did however put 10$ to my account, but for what? I will NEVER order from that place again. SO BAD!!!!"

We ordered Kung Bao chicken, chicken fried rice, egg rolls, and curry chicken. When I placed the order by phone, I specifically ordered spicy for the Kung Bao chicken, but it was medium spicy at best. I also asked for the HOUSE spicy mustard, and instead of sending the house mustard they sent one packet of spicy mustard, for 3 dinners. Kind of made me mad, but the taste of the food is decent, so it made up for the lack of mustard. Just don&#39;t be so stingy with the dang sauce packets!"

This restaurant is family owned and everyone plays a part in the biz from answering phones, waiting tables and preparing the food. The service is impeccable, ask for Joe. He&#39;s friendly and very knowledgable of the menu.

Speaking of the menu, I have a few faves that I are on a rotation. Rainbow Lo Mein (with chicken, shrimp and beef), schezwan green beans, walnut shrimp just to name a few. Their lo mein is the best around hands down. The food is fresh and prepared fast.

Even though I live a good 45 mins away, I make it a point to stop by with my family. I can&#39;t wait to go back again soon!"

If you call in, your NOT struggling to place an order with someone who hardly speaks English.

The food is always dead on consistent and a rung or two above the competition.

The place is clean and well put together...  One of my litmus tests with Chinese restaurants is the condition of the ceiling tiles: no signs of water damage or discoloration, no missing or mismatched tiles.

I&#39;m addicted to their orange chicken and its my typical order, although I have gone through the bulk of the menu and can&#39;t speak bad about any of the entrees.

I&#39;m by no means suggesting you drive in from the city to check this place, but if you live near by, this should be your first choice for Chinese food."

Three generations of my family have been coming to Green Jade for a very long time. We know the owners which it is a family run business and even being out of state for 3 years they remember my face welcoming me back with delicious food and a wide smile.  The food has never changed, the service has always been excellent and the food is to die for. This place is comfort food to me. I&#39;ve tried many other Chinese food places and have lived out of state in Michigan and Arizona. Nothing has compared to this Chicago style Chinese which can be relatatable to new york style menu, some items. My favorites are the sesami chicken which is sweet spicey chicken..this is a must have! I haven&#39;t found any place that does it like this. The shrimp lomain is the best here, delicious sauce and right amount of noodles with big shrimp.The shrimp fried rice is great. I always also get the happy family, beef and broccoli,  three deliciously, sweet and sour chicken. These are things I can voche for and are my familys go to food for take out. Each meal comes with white rice even for take out.Must get the egg rolls! They are to die for and sooo big. Yum! Also the dumpling soup is delicious I always get that when I&#39;m feeling under the weather and my brother tells me he lives for their egg drop soup. There take out is fast, the inside dinning is pleasant with booths and space for large parties or families. The buffet is always good with many options to choose from and a heck of a deal! And I almost forgot there fried dough is unbelievably addicting! Amazing desert served with sweet and sour sauce. I skip the sauce and ask for powder sugar. Hot, moist,  freid dough great dessert. I believe I had 8 last time they were so addicting, my brother and I were fighting for the last one! Please go and try it ! It is a great place to enjoy wonderful family owned Chinese food."

They said they are busy so it is hard to estimate, but more than twice as long is crazy. When I told them that they should be honest with their times , I was told that the food was made fresh , not microwaved. She also told me I should ask how busy they are so I could estimate how long it will take. The horrible experience is not worth it for the food. I would recommend somewhere else.

Well, I have to say I was very unhappy with the whole process and the food.  Firstly, the order was wrong on two entrees.  The other entree was nothing to brag about, either.  The chicken was thin and tough.  I was going to just let it slide and not order from there anymore, but I decided to call and let them know about the wrong order.  The man was nice enough and offered a credit or to make it over again and deliver it to us.  He admitted he hit the &#34;wrong button&#34; when he entered my order, so it was not my fault I got something I didn&#39;t like.  I said a refund would be better, since the food really was not good.  He said he would take care of it.  A week went by and no refund, so I called again and asked for the refund.  He said he would call his bank and take care of it again.  O.K., it&#39;s been over a month or more and still no refund.  I would just take the damn credit at this point, but the food was not good and I don&#39;t want another order of crappy food.  

I really didn&#39;t want to write this review, but I work hard for my money, as everyone does, and certainly did not get my money&#39;s worth this time.  

Sorry, off to find a better place the next time I crave Chinese."

I&#39;m not sure what happened to them, but they&#39;re seriously slipping and have gone starkly down hill.

We went in for their lunch buffet, which we&#39;ve done before in the past. Each visit has been a bit more disappointing than the last, and this one took the cake. 

First, when we walked in, the hostess ignored us entirely as she was too busy texting on her phone. We stood there for five minutes until someone who might have been a server or a busboy, couldn&#39;t tell, came out and acknowledged us with a nod. So we assumed we should seat ourselves and sat down.

Eventually, about 5 minutes later, he brought us tea and water. The hostess was still texting. 

The plates up at the buffet were often dirty. We had to sift through bowls and plates to find ones that didn&#39;t have dried food stuck to them. 

The food at the buffet was sparse, and looked old. The fried wontons and eggrolls, what there were of them, were burned. The greenbeans looked positively rancid. The eggdrop soup tasted of nothing but corn and starch. The hot and sour soup was more like Soy Sauce Soup. 

The lo-mein was the best thing available, and wasn&#39;t half bad (the only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1). 

Eventually we went up to pay, and the same server or busboy or whomever he was had to ring us up, as the hostess had taken her phone somewhere else, probably to text in private away from those annoying customers. 

Sorry Green Jade, you used to be one of the best places around, but now you&#39;re an episode of Kitchen Nightmares waiting to happen. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back."

The food was very enjoyable.  My wife and I each had the Sante Fe Chicken, which was filled with flavor and a good portion size.  However, the various tequila drinks they have are the most unique trait of this place, outside of the monkey themed decorations.  The margarita I had was strong, but still had flavor to it, and came in a large glass.  It was well worth the price, which was pretty standard for margaritas.

The best part was the extremely friendly staff.  Our server, Rishi, was very friendly and had a personality, joking with us each time he came to make sure everything was going well.  At one point, another gentleman, who appeared to be an owner/manager, came by and made a quick appearance just to make sure everything was going well and even asked us if we wouldn&#39;t mind providing feedback later so they could keep improving.

But if the owner can sit around and not even care for his customers needs before his own drink... Is really where I wanna spend money.

Could have got the guac at costco and made better fish tacos on my own. Waste of twenty bucks.

We ordered the fajita skillet with the queso dip which was delicious. The Queso dip is homemade so I will suggest ordering it before you arrive to the restaurant, if you are going to eat it as appetizer it takes a while for it to get done. But it is worth it. The service and food was good even after my sisters and I were some of the last people in the restaurant we were not kicked out. Lol

Make reservations they are very busy on weekends.

I will definitely be returning"

The Baby Blue margarita was loaded with fresh berries, which made it a perfect summer drink.

On to the meal and drinks-

The bartender made us drinks that were not on the menu and it was fantastic.  I then shared with our waiter that I needed to eat gluten free and he was very accommodating with it.  Although there were not many gluten free choices, I was able to eat safely, which is what matters most. 

I ordered the steak tacos and they were fantastic. The side of guacamole was great as well.

We&#39;ve talked about going since it opened up but for one reason or another never gone.  (We&#39;re not &#39;bar people&#39; and over time the Tipsi Monkey seems to be marketing itself as more of a bar than a restaurant, so that&#39;s part of it.)  But finally this week we went...and are glad we did.  

We went about five o&#39;clock mid-week and found the place nicely designed, clean, and the music at a reasonable level.  We opted to sit in the dining area instead of the bar area, which is nice.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  The $5 happy hour margarita surprised us by being HUGE.  We ordered the Tacos for Two which we also found tasty and plentiful.  (So much so that we took home leftovers.  I won&#39;t promise that you will since we each had just two tacos and the are small, but it was plenty for us.)  The rest of the menu was not expansive, but also not small and we saw other items we&#39;d like to try on future visits.  The cost is about what we expected to pay for a sit-down place with table service.

All in all, we were extremely pleased with our experience and plan to add it to our list of regular places.    :-)"

My boyfriend and I had such a great time. RAj our waiter was so helpful and his suggestions were excellent. I tried the not on the menu margarita with habanero infused simple syrup with muddled cucumber and tangerine. It was by far the best margarita I have ever had. Tangy, a little sweet with freshness from the cucumber and then a slight kick of heat as an afterthought. My boyfriend had the sangria swirl margarita that was tasty as well. 
 We had a flight of tequila shots that Raj picked for us. Great choices! 
 We chose the potato chorizo tacquitos as our app. Unbelievably tasty. Like Mexican comfort food. The fried tortillas were so fresh and crispy and the inside potato was fluffy with some melty chihuahua cheese to add to the goodness. A little more chorizo would have been perfect.
 I had the steak tacos with onion, cilantro, and lime. 4 street taco sized tacos per order. Wonderful two bite treats. Steak was cooked perfectly and those little tortillas were warm with the right amount of chew. Little bouncy fluffy tortillas. 
 My boyfriend had the steak, chicken, and shrimp fajitas which he said were the best he has ever had. I tried his shrimp and it was perfectly cooked and the freshness really stood out.
 The decor is fun and tasteful. Everyone dining there last night looked like they were having a great time. Lots of smiling faces and laughter filled the room. Can&#39;t say enough good things!"

We read the reviews before going in, and can&#39;t help but laugh at what people have said. We each had a huge margarita, shared two appetizers and each had an entree and our bill was only $75. Curious to know where people go for a sit down dinner and get the quantity of food, plus the quality for any cheaper. Obviously they don&#39;t know or understand the food business. Thank you tipsi monkey for a great date night! We will be coming back! 

For those of you who won&#39;t try this place because of a few &#34;it&#39;s expensive&#34; or bad reviews, I highly suggest you rethink that. Not everyone will have a bad experience, if that was the case, it wouldn&#39;t be open!"

Upon arriving, I was a little hesitant because the Tipsi Monkey does have a bar atmosphere to it. I was a worried our tots may stick out.

After we were seated, and as the evening progressed, I was pleasantly surprised. They had high chairs and we were seated in the slightly separate section towards the back. Also, the place was loud enough that I didn&#39;t have to worry about the kids bothering anyone. (Phewf!)

The waitress was very friendly and checked on us frequently. The food was delicious. My daughter especially loved the nachos and I loved the spicy salsa.

1st star goes to the name. the name itself sounds fun and somewhere I wanted to check out. I have heard about this place and heard both good things and bad, so I was more than happy to try it out for the name alone. 

2nd star goes to our adorable server. She was friendly and totally personable. She had her flaws I will talk about later, but she&#39;s a keeper for sure!

3rd star goes to the chips and salsa. The salsa was fresh and the chips were delicious. It was not very oniony and I&#39;m always a fan of that! Well done, TM!

Fourth star is for the food. It&#39;s excellent. The chicken tortilla soup was amazing. They really know how to cook here!!

We decided to do the taco party. You have a choice of two meats. We chose the chicken and the BBQ pork. The barbecue pork was shredded and had an excellent flavor. The chicken was very well seasoned. I was not crazy about how they served it. Everything came in little cups. Really took up a lot of table space. There was two of us eating and the table was very crowded with all these little cups. I can&#39;t imagine if we were 4 people at the table, there would not have been anywhere for anyone to put their beverage or even two more plates.

5th missing star goes to the staff. Our server was friendly and totally personable. She really was adorable but she needs to learn the menu a little better and we suggested to the owner that he have the staff try all the items on the menu so they know what their talking about. The response of &#34;I cant really tell you because I never had it&#34; doesn&#39;t work for me.

The pricing...they are severely overcharging for what they are serving. I could see paying what they charge in downtown Chicago or even a fancy neighborhood like Barrington, but it doesn&#39;t work in Bartlett and I foresee that being an issue for the owners down the road."

Setup:
3ish on a Saturday. 
6 people
Place was almost empty.

Food:
Tri-color chips and salsa- Hot and fresh! Salsa was okay, fresh but nothing special. We also got a hot Salsa that was quite good. 8 out of 10

Quest Fundito- This was a surprise!!! This was Excellent! Caramelized onions with a fantastic sauce! Well worth it! Solid 9

Traditional Steak Tacos- Best flavor for 
a traditional taco I have found. Good sized portion! 10 for what it is.

Chicken Quesadillas- Good 7

Guac- Tasty and fresh 8

Kids meals are the best I have ever gotten!!! Huge plate, with high quality food rather than the sad food kids usually get! Fresh made fries that are super thin and really good! Kids had enchiladas and they ate the plate clean! 10!

Over all I would go back regularly if I lived near by, but I will make the hour trip every now and again! I really want to try the drinks!  

The only gripe I have is that the video poker machines and bar style ads/signs out front do this place a disservice. I almost did not bring the family inside since it looked like a dive bar from the front. Someone spent a lot of time building a great brand and menu, I think they should stick to being the great/high-end place they are and not fall into the crappy bar promo stuff I&#39;m seeing plastered all over the place. The inside of this place looks great too and was well decorated for Halloween. I know the Machines are a good source of revenue but put them in back out of sight.

The TV show bar rescue comes to mind with all the statistics on why to avoid neon and bar/ beer signs. This place is waaay to good for that!

The margaritas are delicious, don&#39;t get me wrong. But they are sooooo good that they try to distract you from the horrible food. The queso fundido had too many distractions in it, I like my queso simple. The shrimp tacos tasted like sun screen and the steak tacos were marinated it some gross sauce.

I got the fish tacos and they were very well made
This place is right across my friends new place so we thought we&#39;d give it a try for the first time and it was a pretty good experience.

Our first impression of the motif:  It&#39;s cute, quirky, and quaint with charming, little monkeys stenciled on the walls.  This is a taco and tequila bar.  Interestingly, they did not have Mexican music playing; rather, they were playing something more eclectic, something rhythmic, which was nice to hear something different and unexpected.

Service:  Pleasant, attentive service.  Drinks and orders were timely placed and delivered.  We did not need to ask for anything additional.  Our entrees were served exactly as requested.  Plates were cleaned from the table in an appropriate time frame after eating.

The food:  Wow!  First, we were served with multicolored corn chips and homemade salsa with just the right amount of heat to it.  We couldn&#39;t stop eating the chips and salsa, not because we were hungry, but because it tasted so good!  I think we had three refills of salsa.  

As for our entrees, two of four of us had the carnitas tacos and loved them!  They were recommended and oh, so good!!   The portion size for the tacos is good -- four small tacos with an option of adding beans and rice.  The beans were cooked perfectly.  Most of the time when I get refried beans in a restaurant, they are extraordinarily dry, like they were scraped off the inside of the pan. Yuk!  Not even close to that with the beans at the Tipsi Monkey.  These beans were served just right -- right temperature, right color (not an overcooked brown color), and the right texture (not that &#34;sticky&#34; dried out look).  These were the best beans I&#39;ve had in a very long time.

The third person in our party got the pulled pork tacos and loved those too!  The fourth member of our party ordered a burrito.  Holy smokes!! That thing was huge!  She ate the whole burrito and loved it!!  I don&#39;t even know where she put it all.

Drinks:  We didn&#39;t try any tequila this visit.  We ordered domestic bottles of beer, which were on special for the month. 

Unfortunately, I don&#39;t live in the area or I would definitely go back to the Tipsi Monkey soon.  Next time I am in or around Bartlett, however, I will make an effort to go back to this place though.  

Keep up the great service and excellent food, Tipsi Monkey!!  :-)"

Though if I were just reviewing the quality &amp; size of their margaritas I&#39;d have to go with 5 stars! ;-)

The food is good, the portions are decent but not gigantic for most things.  I&#39;m sticking with 3 stars because:
-I think the prices may seem a tiny bit higher than your standard Mexican restaurant
-The menu is definitely limited compared to other Mexican restaurants but what they do have is good (love those fish tacos!)
-The service has just been okay.  Not bad but not as friendly or attentive as I would like.
-The restaurant is tiny.  When they are busy it fills up fast and it&#39;s a bit claustrophobic and very LOUD in there.

It does have fun but very nice decor and those margaritas and fish tacos will definitely have me coming back on occasion."

We were a party of two toddlers and two sets of parents but they seated us quickly and got us two high chairs.  We were served two big bowls of chips and salsa.  The salsa had a nice flavor too it.  I ate too much chips and salsa for sure.  
This place is more of a tex-mex place.  But that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.  One thing that stood out to me which is kinda iffy is the fact that an order of rice, beans, and cheese costs $4.50.  They are listed on the same line in the menu as $1.50  I think that&#39;s kind of expensive.
I had the fish tacos, which were pretty delicious.  They came with a cole slaw, and some sweet and spicy sauce.  I gobbled them down.  I&#39;ll admit I was kinda missing the cilantro and onion.  But, it was still delicious and they used corn tortillas.  
I&#39;ll be back again I&#39;m sure."

Both times I was there they had live music and that duo did good oldies &amp; dance tunes that got folks up &amp; dancing which added to the comfort &amp; cozy, they kept the current sports teams games on the large screens - a plus!

Cons- I had heard from a couple people who liked the food &amp; didn&#39;t like the service and wouldn&#39;t come &amp; meet me there.  Unfortunately the service really left a lot to be desired and could not be considered good.  I spent well over a hundred dollars on dinner and drinks and at one point we had to go to the bar to get drinks, the table was piled with dishes from dinner, beer bottles and empty glasses that just sat there on table for over an hour without them being cleared off.   Either they need to train the staff to provide better customer service or hire someone to clear tables.  
As pleasant, personable and warm as the server was  doesn&#39;t make up for the poor level of service.

That being said I will stop in again for drinks only and see if the service has improved before I spend again the  kind of money I spent there before."

I won&#39;t pile on with the disappointment on the food but will make one simple recommendation I would make to the chef, when I eat a a shrimp fajita I really don&#39;t want to dig through veggies and sauce to take the hard shells off of the tails of the shrimp.   I do prefer to manage that mess than eating the shells, but I would recommend removing shells before serving them mixed in with a larger dish."

**I like the streamlined menu (hey, if you do something right, there&#39;s no need to have 18 pages of fluff)
**I also liked the portion sizes
**The salsa was very flavorful but not spicy which is EXACTLY how my white butt likes it (spicy and I are not besties)
**The drink I got (the ape margarita) was REALLY strong.  LOVED it.  Very delicious.  My friend&#39;s strawberry margarita was really good as well!
**The nachos were really yummy--I like when nachos have refried beans on them!
**I ordered the chicken Parrilla, and enjoyed it immensely!


Our waitress was really sweet, attentive, and really kept us happy and well-fed!  

What I didn&#39;t like about the place was how small it was.  You know those restaurants where you see it from the outside, and it is WAY bigger once you get inside?  This is NOT one of those restaurants.  We had a hard time getting in and out of our seats because it&#39;s pretty tightly cramped.

The food is great, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the drinks are AMAZING!

We were greeted by the owner&#39;s daughter and promptly seated with a smile.  She&#39;s a spunky, young woman who had me chuckling a few times over the course of the evening.  Fresh, warm chips hit the table with a nice chunky salsa.  We took care of those pretty quickly and our waitress offered more, but we decided to save room for the main dishes.

The menu is pretty simple.  It was a pleasant surprise to see a streamlined menu.  Do one thing &amp; do it right.  Some appetizers - maybe six or eight of them, some unique entrees that come with rice and beans, many varieties of tacos, a few simple side dishes, drinks and desserts.  My son decided to try the shrimp tacos.  This was a platter of four tacos on blue corn tortillas with breaded shrimp, tasty cole slaw and a sweet and spicy sauce.  He did a good job of clearing his plate.  My husband and I decided to have a &#39;Taco Party&#39;!  We chose two meats - seasoned steak and lightly breaded tilapia (fish).  He opted for flour tortillas &amp; I chose soft corn (red corn) tortillas.  The accompaniments were plentiful!  A mound of guacamole, onions &amp; cilantro, pico de gallo, sour cream, refried beans, the sweet &amp; spicy sauce, a creamy cole slaw and honestly, there were a couple more things that I didn&#39;t use, so I can&#39;t place them right now.  We ate all of the meat and the cole slaw, but didn&#39;t even come close to using up everything else.  

Our waitress was lovely...a real sweetheart.  She kept our glasses full and promptly moved dirty dishes off of the table.  

We also met the owner.  He arrived at the end of the meal, right along with the check.  It turns out that this is definitely not his first rodeo.  With different restaurant concepts in Elgin, Arlington Heights (I think?) and Southern Illinois, he is a seasoned restaurateur.  Soft spoken and maybe even a little shy, our conversation was quick.  But I was glad to meet the man behind our newest Bartlett restaurant.  I wish him well and will look forward to another tasty meal again soon!"

At the Tipsi Monkey, the &#34;monkey&#34; theme or name was everywhere from their drink specials to the accent decorations around the bar. Even their free WiFi password had a monkey word in it (but you&#39;ll have to ask your server for that).

Although the Tipsi Monkey is billed as a Taco &amp; Tequila Bar, I usually rate any place that serves Mexican food by their enchiladas. So on my first visit to the Tipsi Monkey, I ordered their enchilada dinner and a small side of guacamole. The dinner came with the standard beans and Spanish rice.

I wasn&#39;t really impressed with the quality of the enchiladas. The server did tell me the red sauce wasn&#39;t spicy, so I was okay with that. However, the chicken and corn tortillas were quite mushy together; the texture did not meet my expectations. The side of guacamole was okay (nothing special).

I did like their regular Margarita (again with a Monkey name). I&#39;m not a big drinker and I don&#39;t like overly strong drinks. Whereas I typically feel the effects of the tequila after sipping 1/4 of a typical Margarita, this drink was very mellow and either really smooth with a good quality tequila or not much alcohol at all. I finished the whole thing without much of a buzz at all, so I wondered about their mix/alcohol ratio. There was an option to add an extra monkey themed shot of tequila to the Margarita, but I opted out this time not knowing how strong their drinks were. May have to try that next time to make a good comparison.

On my next visit, I&#39;ll probably try their tacos, pass on the enchiladas and go for the upshot in a Margarita or try their Sangria. And I&#39;ll try to save room for this unique banana dessert that was on the menu."

We had the margaritas, which were tasty but I honestly was not able to taste the alcohol in it, with the size of it, I thought I would get at least a good buzz and felt nothing. Lol Salsa is good, chips are ok. 
Service: ok
Tortilla soup did taste a bit like watered down tomato soup and was missing the tortillas. Nachos were ok but nothing that I would later crave. 
I liked the avocado in the soup.

I gave 2 stars due to effort- waitress was very kind.  This place was dead on a Saturday night.  I enjoyed the taste of the salsa but if you ate the chips without it- ewww.  They had a nasty fried in oil taste.  My fish tacos were bland, nothing special, I&#39;ve had WAY better.  The sangria- SIGH- I really thought this place would know how to make good sangria but it had the &#34;Hawaiian punch&#34; taste to it.  Go to Cooper&#39;s Hawk if you want a real sangria.  The snow monkey margarita was like a bad White Russian.  Lastly, I tried a margarita on the rocks.  Tasted like toilet water.  I couldn&#39;t even finish it and it was Saturday and I wanted to drink!  There is nothing here that will EVER bring me back.

However, tonight was terrible, and I definitely will not be back. 
It wasn&#39;t packed, but service was still slow. Our waitress was an unenthusiastic girl, not engaging or friendly. My first drink was alright, not very strong, and my friend and I split the chicken enchiladas. They were so so, nothing special. Then I ordered my second drink. 
My second drink, a Snow Monkey, arrived with a thick black hair in it. It was nauseating to look at, we could not stop gagging. It took forever for us to flag someone down, just wanting it to be taken away. Finally, a male server walks by, and we stop him and inform him of the hair. He says &#34;ooooh....that&#39;s probably my hair....&#34; (Awkward silence) &#34;do you want me to make you another one?&#34;  I decline, and he offered me a shot of tequila, &#34;as there&#39;s definitely no hair in the tequila&#34;.  I decline again and ask for our bill. There was no apology, no disgusted shock...and then he proceeded to bring drinks to the older couple at the next table and talk to them-- &#34;I don&#39;t know why they&#39;re so grossed out about,&#34; loudly talking about us with other customers--very inappropriate. 
After we left, my friend called to speak to the manager and complain. There was apparently no manager on duty, but we did learn that the male server is the owner&#39;s son--I suppose that is why he feels he can treat customers with such disdain. 
The girl on the phone, Jessica, was very sweet, apologized profusely, and offered us free drinks for the next time we come in...yet that&#39;s unnecessary, we will not be back."

Arrived around 6:30.  Our first clue should have been that this very small place had several open tables at 6:30 on a Saturday when there are not many options in Bartlett.  After terrible food/service at the previous concept here, we decided to give this one a try.

All started out great.  The salsa was fantastic, some of the best I&#39;ve had in a while.  Although, I question giving out some pretty spicy (in a good way) salsa and then allowing the server to not return with water or take our drink order for 5-10 minutes.  Our mouths were a bit warm.

With our hopes high, we ordered the tacos for two meal.  We got the grilled steak and the pulled pork with flour tortillas.  We were brought out a nicely displayed assortment of toppings.  We made our first tacos and dug in.  Sadly, we instantly noticed that there was zero flavor to these.  Even the sour creme had no flavor.  The meat seemed clearly processed and not fresh.  The pulled pork is very likely the precooked variety available from Cosco.  I did not sense that anything was prepared with any pride or prepared fresh.  Even the tortillas were not homemade and just a bland generic type.

Service, much like when this place was Italian was slow, without personality, and simply not good enough.  My wife ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt.  She received one with no salt.  Rather than send it back, she kept it as she was very thirsty from the hot salsa.  Her drink was not very good.  Tasted either pre-made or prepared with a store bought margarita mix and tequila.  A bar featuring tequila should at least have enough pride to mix real margaritas.

We noticed &#34;comment cards&#34; stuck in with the check.  My wife suggested this means that ownership knows something is wrong, but either does not believe it or is clueless to it.  The manager did visit our table as we ate and asked us if everything was good.  I told her that the salsa was fantastic but the food was terrible and bland.  She did not seem too shocked by this and I sense she has heard this before.  We also noticed the table next to us scarfed down their chips and salsa, but left most of their dinner untouched.

We&#39;d love nothing more than to find a great local place to eat (We do love the other Mexican restaurant located down the street from here), but until things change here, we won&#39;t be back.  I predict that a for sale sign will be on the front door by years end.

We&#39;ll tolerate questionable service for a good product.  Questionable service and a poor product means we simply will bring our business to a competitor."

Maybe we should have had the fish tacos. Had the skirt steak tacos. Dry and tasteless. Boyfriend had the chorizo tacos. Yuk O! Spicy Kennel Ration. Refried beans was like eating nothing. Just texture and NO taste. Maybe we are Mexican restaurant spoiled. We did comment to each other that people probably don&#39;t come here for the food. It would be a great place to go to for just the alcohol. Margarita was great. But, I mean, even the salsa was bad. So, what do you have with the margarita? We were really hoping this would be a good place. To survive in this area, you need two things: Good food and reasonable prices. The prices are ok, but the food is not there. This is off our list. Kinda sad.


I need to update this review. They deserve some credit. It has gotten better. It is what it is. A place to hang out. The food isn&#39;t good; it isn&#39;t bad (mostly) now. It is a place to get margaritas. Food is a secondary purpose. But, since my last review, it really is much better."

Great chips and salsa!! 
Salsa is not spicy, but very fresh and flavorful!

We had the taco party for two ... perfect portions for &#34;average&#34; eaters!
If you like bigger portions for one, this is probably a bit on the smaller side for two.

Margartias were delicious!! $6 each - pretty good in my eyes - expecially for the size!

Service was great too!

My ONLY reason for 4 stars is I would have liked to see just a little bit more on the menu - I love some basic favorites that I didn&#39;t see on the menu.

We will def. be back!!"

I&#39;ve eaten here a few times and each time it has become progressively worse. Maybe I won&#39;t be an idiot next time and remember not to eat here. The most recent visit consisted of over cooked shrimp and steak. A friend&#39;s dish was prepared with the wrong sides. We asked for a frozen margarita and they made it on the rocks. When asked to make it frozen they said it would be watered down because they would add ice. They didn&#39;t think to remake it. A member of the staff even admitted that her burger was over cooked earlier that day.

Let me just say that we are pretty easy to please.  Any time I don&#39;t have to cook is an automatic star from me!

We walked in and it seemed to be pretty busy.  We were told that there would be about a 10-15 minute wait.  We were okay with that - we&#39;ve waited longer than that in other places.  The problem was, the restaurant is small and there was no place to stand to wait for a table.  It looks like there was some type of bench at one point, but there are now gaming machines on top of it so that seating has been taken away.  So if the bar is packed (which it was) there is no place to wait but in front of the door, which isn&#39;t good when other people are coming in behind you.  My suggestion - take out the machines and open the seating back up.

We didn&#39;t have to wait too long for a table.  Once we were seated, the service was awful.  We were seated by the hostess and left to wait for our server.  Our waiter didn&#39;t show up to our table for at least 10 minutes.  By this time, we were ready to order and figured we would order everything at once since we didn&#39;t know when our waiter would be back at our table.  We ordered drinks, an appetizer and our meals.  We thought we may be in trouble since he never wrote our order down.  He came back to our table -TWICE- to ask us again what we ordered for meals.  While we were waiting for our drinks, we noticed that other tables were getting chips and salsa - something we hadn&#39;t gotten yet in the now 20 minutes of sitting there.  Our waiter didn&#39;t seem to be returning to our table so we finally flagged someone down and got our chips and salsa.  They were finally delivered - from the woman busing the tables!  Our drinks came 15 minutes after we ordered them (our waiter told us that the bartender was backed up.  Really?  That far behind?)  Another 20 minutes later, we got our meals - never got our appetizers!  No one came by to ask us how we were doing, did we need anything, how was everything, etc.  Should we have asked for them?  Yes - and we would have if someone would have come to our table to check on us.  We kept seeing the server, but could never get his attention.  We finished our meal and flagged down our waiter and asked for the bill.  He delivered it and quickly took off to another table.  My husband noticed the appetizers were still on the bill.  We had to flag down someone AGAIN and told her we were charged for an appetizer that we never received.  The response was &#34;Oh, we wondered where they went.&#34;  WHAT!  Someone picked up our appetizers!  Maybe if you would have checked on us we could have told you that we didn&#39;t get them.  The woman who fixed the bill (I assume she was the manager) told us that she would buy us an appetizer the next time we come in (which is probably never).

As for the food - if you are looking for a lot of choices in Mexican food, this is not the place for you.  They have a very limited menus.  I had the tacos, which I thought were good.  My husband had the Enchiladas Luis, which is &#34;stuffed with grilled steak&#34; - or so they say.  My husband found only a small piece of steak and the rest was ground beef.

This probably could be a good place to go for drinks and appetizers (if you can get them) but I know that we will not be going back."

My 3rd and last time here because
1) the Sangria had very little alcohol
 2) despite being seated in the back room where I had hoped for a quieter experience, a table of 8 who were talking exceedingly loud about their teaching experiences (not something to broadcast) The smaller seating up front was even louder so it wouldn&#39;t have helped to move. 
 3) the entree was not edible. I ordered the pork special, described by the waiter as &#34;slow cooked all day long,&#34; I love me some good tender pork, but this was so salty I had to quit after 2 bites.Strangely the rice was also salty! Beans were OK and I even tried putting the pork in the soft tacos that came with it with lettuce, guacamole and tomatoes and bean to tone down the salt but didn&#39;t work. When the waiter noticed I had not eaten it, he asked if I wanted it boxed. I told him I could not eat it because of the salt, and he called the manager. I asked if the manager had tasted this -- he said no, but he knows they add a lot of spices. I said I can taste a little chile powder but the salt is overwhelming. He did take the entree off my bill. 

The one thing I had there my 2nd time  that was good was the chile shrimp appetizer. If you want to go just for drinks and appetizers, although the choices are few, you might be better off. 

The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that the chips and salsa were good, especially the green chile salsa."

The margarita was large and very good. We ordered an appetizer that had cheese and peppers and it came with pita chips. It was outstanding. The chips and salsa that they give you was also great. Probably one of the bests salsas that I ever had. I ordered the fish tacos and they were great. They came with a sweet/spicy sauce and a cole slaw, which I put on the tacos. My wife ordered the enchilladas and that was very good as well. It&#39;s worth checking out. The inside of the place seem cramped. They need to lose the large walls that must be used for private parties and open the place up a little bit. I would also do something with the interior design. It&#39;s kind of dark, like a neighborhood tavern. The food is definitely worth going back for."

- You shouldn&#39;t expect your waiter to actually serve the table, because this is a tequila bar and the waiter is drunk, and you should be, too.

- You shouldn&#39;t expect the food to be all that great (worst guac I&#39;ve had in a very long time), because this is a tequila bar and why are you eating and not drinking? 

- You shouldn&#39;t expect to be given the food you ordered, because this is a tequila bar and, Anything We Serve Goes Great With Tequila! (And shame on you for not ordering tequila.)

To the restaurant&#39;s credit, my dinner was comped as soon as I pointed out that it was still incorrect after the third attempt. But had the waiter actually written down the order, or had been slightly more sober, my order might have been done correctly the first time. Aside from the guacamole the rest of the food was okay, and this is the only reason I am bumping up the review to 2 stars. I cannot comment on the drinks as we didn&#39;t have any mixed drinks. 

If you are looking for a place to have a few drinks, other than a sports bar, in Bartlett, this is probably an okay place. If you are looking for great food, I&#39;d move along."

Service was good, Guac was interesting spiced with cinnamon maybe it was good but I&#39;ve never seen it cut with chopped lettuce, that was a little too strange.

I can honestly say I am not a fan of this place. Its a great and  cute concep in the heart of bartlett but dissapointed greatly! This place is poorly managed and bad service. My boyfriend found a hair in his Tacos (which we understand happens on rear occurances).The  Manager never came out  and apologized and see how every else was.We did see him but was preoccupied with other things. That was only the beginning and was all downhill from there. The Plates were completely dirty. There was NO bus boy. They never filled out glasses with water...when they were clearly empty. I orderd the potato churro...it must have been deep friend in OLDDDDDD oil....cause i could taste the old oil taste. super greasy and gross. I litterally walked out with a stomachache. I ordered the tipsi monkey Martini... the flavors of the alcohol did not go well together. It was SOOOOOOOOOO sweet it was undrinkable. My boyfriend ordered chilled tequilla...I dont think the bartender knows what &#34;chilled meant.  We never got it right all 3 times we ordered the tequila. Majority of us ate....the waiter NEVER cleared any of the plates from the table when we were done eating....they sat on the table until after we left. So when we left the table was FULL of empty plates and glasses. Very unorganized and uncleanly. This place has a long way to go if they&#39;re ever going to make it a successful restaruant. I Will (and my friends) never go back here again. Not impressed. They clearly dont know what there doing there!

We walked in and the place was smaller and crowded inside so we decided to get a table outside, plus it was really nice out. Our server came to our table and introduced himself and then asked our names, which he used the rest of the night. I thought this was a very nice added touch, made you feel a little more important. 
Our server brought out free chips and salsa for the table. The salsa was homemade and amazing. Great flavor and not to spicy. After we had finished the plate of chips and salsa we would just keep bringing us more...Im pretty sure we had about 6 plates of chips and salsa throughout the night!!! I ordered a corona-rita, they are the special on Friday($10.00). VERY GOOD, I had never had one and glad I finally did. The margarita was very yummy on its own too!! For dinner I got the enchiladas luis with chicken. The food came out very fast and the portion sizes were huge, I probably could have split it with my friend except the rice and refried beans were so good I ate all those by myself.

They do have tables to sit and eat, but when there&#39;s no seating, there is a huge bar to sit at.

The food was really good.  Had the venison burger, which was excellent.  Came on a pretzel bun which was so good.

As you might guess, they have a huge selection of whiskey and bourbon.  If you like beers, good selection on tab and bottles.

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more food.  A lot of appetizers and they have a section called boards.  They bring out a small board that has different stuff depending on what you want.  Could be meats and cheeses, or hummus and pita.

Highly recommend going"

The drinks are a little too pricey for me. I had the Strawberry Bellini and it was just ok in my opinion. 

The menu items look very delicious! I definitely want to come back to try a salad. 

The macaroni and cheese was very creamy and tasty. I enjoyed the mix of cheeses they  used and the bread crumbs on top. The portion size was generous. 

My mother had the shrimp and grits. She enjoyed the grits quite a bit but for me the bacon in the grits is too overpowering. The bite I had was good but I&#39;d get sick of it fast because of the bacon. If you like bacon you&#39;d find the grits delicious with a great texture. The shrimp was too spicy/salty. 

The space is really small so if it is busy good luck! Also, their website states they open at 12 but I got there at 11:50 and the place was packed! So I&#39;m not sure when they actually open."

We were told it would be about a 30 minute wait, so we walked around for 30 minutes. We went back and they still didn&#39;t have any tables but some seats at the bar opened up so we took those. We ordered drinks and duck poutine (I HIGHLY recommend this). The duck poutine was a large dish for just two people but it is sooooo good! I ordered the Berkshire burger, it was excellent and my husband ordered the venison burger which he also said was excellent. We were alreaDy talking about what we would order next time! 

I would say prepare to wait for a table, I personally wouldn&#39;t even try to go to this place on a weekend. Probably not a good place for groups larger than 4 because of the difficulty of getting a table. It&#39;s a little noisy- we don&#39;t mind this but I know some people do.

There are so many awesome restaurants to check out, and Barrel and Rye is one of those awesome restaurants.  My friend and I came on a early Saturday evening, and we enjoyed our experience here.  I don&#39;t believe they accept reservations, so I would imagine there might be a wait for a table if you are coming on the weekend during a prime time.  The place was pretty full by the time we left around 5pm.

This restaurant has many different types of whiskey&#39;s to choose from, but there are also non whiskey cocktails if whiskey isn&#39;t your spirit of choice.  To drink, I had the Smoked Manhattan cocktail, and this cocktail exceeded my expectations.  I&#39;m not sure what makes this Manhattan &#34;smoked&#34;, but there definitely is something in the ingredients or preparation of this Manhattan that makes it stand out from other Manhattan&#39;s.  The taste of the cocktail was slightly more elevated than other Manhattan&#39;s, but also still extremely smooth.  

To eat, I opted for the &#34;Dip&#34; sandwich.  This sandwich has thin slices of marinated lamb, along  with cheese and veggies.  Since this sandwich came with an au jus sauce, it reminded me of a gourmet Italian beef sandwich.  The &#34;Dip&#34; sandwich is a great option if you are looking for a hearty sandwich."

I visited on Tuesday with Jacqueline B. to grab lunch and I immediately loved the space. We described it as &#34;rustic chic&#34;. There&#39;s grey patterned ceilings with light bulb fixtures hanging from them, blue patterns on the walls and modern [fake] mini deer heads scattered throughout. I try not to have the &#34;look&#34; of a place determine my liking of it but barrel + rye sold me immediately. This place truly reminded me of a Wicker Park/Lincoln Park area restaurant. There was a cute outdoor area to sit but because it was about 96 degrees we confidently chose to eat inside. 

We got seated right away at a high table next to the window and took a look at the menu. Of course, I decided on the grilled cheese with a &#34;shot&#34; of tomato soup and a side of fries. Man oh man was it tasty! The sandwich itself was hearty and I had thought after the first half that I may need a box to take home. I&#39;m definitely a fan of grilled cheese dipped in soup so I really liked the concept of a &#34;shot&#34; of tomato soup. Most restaurants give you an entire bowl to finish but even with the size of the grilled cheese, the soup was exactly enough for a dip each bite! The side of fries were exactly how fries should be made. Super tasty, crispy with a soft potato center. Yes please. Jacqueline B. and I were in the area to work so a drink wasn&#39;t our top priority but I would LOVE to come back to take a load off and sip on a sweet concoction. 

Our waitress seemed attentive and nice - nothing too under or overwhelming. You definitely receive a very &#34;chill&#34; vibe here. It was getting a little crowded inside (and from what I saw, outside too) but it seemed like the employees had a good handle on things. Very much appreciated!

Overall, I highly recommend barrel + rye. The food was great, the atmosphere is stress and rush-free and the restaurant itself is just cool to be in. Perfect spot for lunch or a drink in my opinion!"

Lotsa fresh pita and a terrific pairing of roasted garlic and wasabi hummus offerings. The beer list was quite solid despite it being a cocktail themed restaurant. Server and host were both very friendly and helpful. Nice outside seating area, but it is kinda small (4-5 small tables) and their outside patio chairs are incredibly uncomfortable."

We drove the hour because earlier in the week we called wanting a place with tv&#39;s dinner and drink to watch the game , the told us  I called Barrel And Rye. The guy I spoke with said they have 20 seats in the bar and 8 tables. He recommended we get there around 6 so we could get a seat b4 the game. I said we were going to eat and then have drinks and watch the game. He said no problem.

I had the venison burger, my friend had the brie burger. Both were awesome! The burgers were just the right size in my opinion, although I was starving haha. The fries were excellent as well. As for drinks, my friend and I are new to the whole whiskey thing, so we didn&#39;t have any of the whiskey flights. But they have quite the selection if you&#39;re into that! We started off with some seasonal cider, which was delish. Then we each tried a signature drink. The bartender was very helpful with that. My friend had the sacred sage, I chose da figgin bears because I liked the name. :) Awesome awesome awesome!!! Da figgin bears is definitely a tasty one for fall. ;) I will definitely be back!"

I&#39;ve come here for late night drinks, dinner, lunch, and early afternoon Sunday funday. It&#39;s a good spot to be at anytime! 

My most recent experience was lunch with a friend. We split the Mac and cheese and each had a salad. We both loved what we ordered! Our server was super nice and funny. Drinks were on point as always.

A restaurant I go to when I&#39;m celebrating, a place I go when I want to drown my sorrows, or just a place to hang out when there&#39;s nothing else to do. Barrel + Rye is that for me.

I originally discovered B+R thanks to Jacqueline B&#39;s review. The first thing that concerned me upon visiting was parking or lack thereof. Parking in downtown areas usually suck but there&#39;s ample (free) parking nearby on the side streets. The restaurant itself is pretty small, so you&#39;ll most likely have a wait. I recommend coming in and putting your name in line, then heading over to one of the wine bars nearby to relax. 

They have a pretty vast menu and I&#39;ve tried a lot of it. My favorite food from here:
+Appetizers: the BBQ shrimp (seriously, don&#39;t miss these) and the Memphis charcuterie
+Sides: Elotes
+Salad: Fattoush- their homemade hummus is to die for
+Drinks: Cranberry Mule or Bubbles and Bramble
+I haven&#39;t tried any of the sandwiches or burgers, but that will be my next trip!

The servers and bartenders here are all incredibly nice and work hard to make sure you&#39;re happy. My husband knew 0 about whiskey, but one of the bartenders spent a fair amount of time explaining the different kinds to him until he decided on something he might like.

When someone asks what my favorite restaurant is, I never hesitate to say &#34;Barrel and Rye in Geneva!!!!&#34;"

This place is really easy on the eyes. Not only is the setup, the decor and the ambience wonderful, but the customer service is also great. We originally were going to eat a full meal but after the hummus appetizer we had and the ciders we were full. The hummus was probably some of the best hummus I have ever had. They had a Mediterranean and a garlic one (i forgot the name) We will definitely be back to enjoy a dinner and I also really liked the fact how the staff was very knowledgeable about gluten free options that they have available."

It is a really, really good addition to downtown Geneva. The decor is perfect, the ambiance is classy and the drinks are unique but not in a weird way.

I honestly feel like I could end with that and be good to go with this review but I won&#39;t.  As a lover of bourbon I had wanted to try this place for a bit.  My husband and I finally made the decision to make it out and it was worth the wait! We showed up super early (5pm) and there was already a possible 1 hour and 15 minute wait!!!! Usually this would make us turn around and find another option... This time we stuck it out and thank goodness we did! We started with the Memphis plate.  The char on the pork sausage, coupled with the cheese and giardiniera was perfection, not to mention the delicious BBQ sauce! 
My husband chose the Southern sandwich which was fried chicken, fried egg, maple syrup, bacon and cheese (aka heart attack) and said it was terrific. He was so imposed with the giardiniera from the app that he orders a side for the sandwich. I ate a crusty from the fried chicken and was very impressed with the spice and savory flavoring.    
I chose the belly burger (grass fed beef patty, house cured pork belly, sauteed onions, havarti cheese, pretzel bun) which was honestly one of the BEST burgers I have ever eaten.  No flavor over powered the other and it was awesome! I forced myself to take half home but it was difficult!
As sides we ordered fries and Mac n cheese.  Both items were well beyond average closer to the heavenly category!
I order the old fashion and my husband ordered garrison brothers neat. The old fashioned was well rounded and balanced.  There was no bite that is often found in an poorly made old fashioned.

I will most definitely be back here.  Just keep in mind it&#39;s worth the wait so plan on putting your name in early then walking around for a bit."

Prices are reasonable, portions will satisfy even the healthiest of eaters, and the food will have your taste buds dancing for hours. 

Seriously the food is gourmet quality fine dining with a casual corner pub feel. The burgers and sandwiches will only leave you wishing you had room to order another. 

If you&#39;re into bourbon and whiskey then this could just be paradise for you. They offer about 200 different varieties  which can vary based on availability and the pours are anything but short. 

If you&#39;re in the area stop in, its an experience that you won&#39;t regret."

Outstanding drinks made by well trained personnel.  The place is small so it fills up quick.

We came later in the afternoon on a Saturday, and they had a 40 minute wait. We were 2 seconds away from leaving when the host told us there were a few seats at the bar with no wait. Done.

The seats at the end of the bars are not ideal (you are in the way of kitchen and waiter/waitress traffic, by the door with cold air blowing in, etc.). However, it was better than waiting 40 minutes. The place is not huge (hence the 40 minute wait). But I feel like the atmosphere, drink selection, and food make up for it. 

I love Edison lights, and they have them here. It&#39;s a nice, but casual place. The drink menu is great. If you like whisky you will love this place. They have quite the variety! We didn&#39;t drink, but I have heard through the grapevine that their cocktails are quite good.

Their menu has a nice variety. Their food is upscale bar food. We ended up getting salads (my sister got the beet/goat cheese and I ordered the salmon salad). Both were very good! Good portion for the price, salmon was perfect, the added ingredients portion to the greens was perfect. A nice light, but filling meal. 

The service was nice as well. The bartender/server was nice and attentive, as well as the host and manager. 

I would definitely come back. Expect a wait, but I feel like it is worth it."

I found 3 of 4 here! Hurray!

As I flipped through the very extensive list of the Whiskey/Scotch variety, (and while I noticed Hibiki and Yamazaki weren&#39;t on the printed menu, I saw Yamazaki on the shelf!), I thought to myself, &#34;You know, Scotch goes really, really well with Venison...&#34;

And on the back page of the menu - there it was! A venison burger for a reasonable price.

Then I found the hummus on the front page, and I wanted just then to move to Geneva.

The hummus arrived on a very large tray with excellent warm pita, veggies, and two different types I had not yet tried - a salsa fusion and a pine-nut fusion. YUM!

The burger arrived perfectly cooked medium rare, and I didn&#39;t even have room for the fries, though the few I had were also quite yummy.

The salmon sandwich was also quite large and very good!

With a variety of cocktail specials and local beers on tap, the excellent service and games on tv will definitely keep folks coming back.

On a weekday evening, we had a 1-hour wait.  At least the wait time was accurate though, and we had a wine flight at Geneva Wine Cellars next door.

Dinner at Barrel &amp; Rye was fantastic.  Our table shared the Brie Cheese Curds and the BBQ Shrimp.  If you&#39;re a fan of brie, cheese, or curds, get those.  I could have eaten the entire appetizer by myself.  The creamy brie is a delicious twist on &#34;normal&#34; cheese curds.

We all ordered salads and all of them were enormous plates piled high with fresh ingredients.  I had the salmon salad and loved every bite.

Cocktails are done well also.  I had the Cranberry Mule.  Although I would have preferred a plain Moscow Mule, it was a festive adaptation of the classic drink.

The atmosphere is dark and classy.  Tables are scrunched close together, which I&#39;m not a fan of, so it was loud too but I didn&#39;t struggle to have a conversation.

The service was great too.  Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and didn&#39;t mind making recommendations.  5 stars all the way."

We went on a weeknight and had a little over an hour wait, they do not do reservations. Some might think that&#39;s a long time but with how much is in downtown Geneva the time went by quick, we went down the street and did some wine tastings, which was good! 

The food and drinks were great. I had a blackberry cocktail which was good, my friends got a cranberry Moscow mule which was also good. For food we got the bbq shrimp appetizer which was super yummy. I got the shrimp salad that had arugula, spinach, Brussels sprouts, and the bbq shrimp with a creamy dressing; I would go back just for that salad, it was so good. The atmosphere was cute, a little too dark for my liking but it was cozy. This place is a little small as well but I think that adds to the overall experience in a positive way.

The food is excellent; it&#39;s creative yet not intimidating, and most importantly it is scrumptious!!! Here&#39;s what we had...
Shrimp App-simple and great. A tad greasy, but the napkins are substantial so that was no problem. 
I ordered the Salmon salad, it is the absolute BEST salad I have ever had. Greens, pears, candied walnuts, cheese and the most amazing dressing and a perfect salmon filet. 
My husband ordered the dry rub BBQ wings as his meal. They were great, although he will try the spicy BBQ next time. The most amazing part was the bleu cheese dipping sauce. The greatest dip, not too strong. 
We shared the brussel sprouts and fries. Embarrassing admission here...these were my first brussel sprouts ever, and I will be getting them again. The fries are almost breaded and then fried. Really tasty. 
It will be hard for me to try something new after that salad, but I bet there are so many other delicious things on the menu. 

Now I made one ordering mistake...An old fashioned cocktail, let&#39;s just say I&#39;m not a bourbon girl so this was not for me. Super strong. My husband ordered after me and did me the favor of ordering the Cranberry Mule. Although he loved it, he switched with me. That drink was perfect, and he won points for that. 

I can&#39;t wait to go back. Warning, go in a small group. There are no reservations and small tables. Also, sit at the bar, we did and skipped the wait."

Cocktail culture and gastro pub are the main descriptors for this lovely place.

Service here is excellent. Jill, our server, is delightful. Not only does she serve the food, she knows and understands cocktails - a rarity. Most bartenders don&#39;t truly understand how to build a good cocktail. When you have servers who can do it, you know the proprietors are focused on the right stuff.

Ambience here is intimate. You won&#39;t bring a large group to this place. They have outside seating in good weather, which is great. Downtown Geneva is a great environment. We&#39;d call this place &#39;sophisticated casual&#39;.

I was immediately impressed with the decor and feel of this place. I love the rustic look. So much so that I literally want to copy their bathrooms and light fixtures in my own house!

When we came in for lunch the place was pretty packed. There were a lot of larger groups of lunching women on this particular Tuesday. We opted for a seat up at the bar. They have a great list of whiskey cocktails, other fun drinks and a small craft beer list. I had their Simon + Garfunkel, which includes Tito&#39;s vodka, parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme, cranberry juice and strawberries. This cocktail was super refreshing and made me feel sophisticated and fancy.

As for food we decided to split a couple things. Our choices went as followed...

Memphis Sausage &amp; Charcuterie: Thuringer sausage, smoked Gouda, bourbon BBQ sauce, sweet and spicy BBQ seasoning, homemade giardiniera. This board of deliciousness is absolutely amazing! I highly suggest it. My husband and I are still dreaming of that sausage. We even tried to recreate this app at home (not even close to as good ad this B+R winner).

B+R Salad with Grilled Shrimp: roasted red pepper, grilled corn, feta cheese, avocado, tortilla strips, bed of mixed greens with a citrus vinaigrette (we added in grilled shrimp). Delicious, light and refreshing. Simple as that.

This last time we came to B+R was at about 7:45 on a Sunday night. Definitely not as busy, but there were a handful of people up at the bar since the Hawks were playing. We sat up at the bar as well - it&#39;s kind of our thing. We enjoy chatting it up with the bartenders.

I ordered the B+R old fashioned (buffalo trace bourbon, simple syrup, angostura bitter&#39;s, regan&#39;s orange bitter&#39;s) to drink and my husband ordered the Ward Eight (george dickel rye, fresh orange juice, fresh lemon juice, pom grenadine). When our drinks were served we both had to laugh. Of course being an old fashioned, my drink looked pretty hard core - dark whiskey with an iceburge cube to top it off. The Ward Eight on the other hand, was a bright pink cocktail. My hubbie wanted to switch drinks, but I let him stick that one out haha. I tried his drink though and let me tell you, it&#39;s a great cocktail - highly suggest it! I really should have switched him.

For dinner we both got burgers. I had the Brie Burger (grass fed burger, creamy brie, grilled pears, caramelized onions - $14) with a side of brussel sprouts (extra $2). My burger was huge and absolutely amazing. The brie, pears and caramelized onions formed a perfect sweet sensation that paired nicely with the burger. I&#39;m really happy I got the brussel sprouts as well, because they were delish! I ended up taking home half a burger and a tad bit of veggies and let me tell you, they were just as good the second time around when I heated up the leftovers!

The servers at B+R are pretty awesome. Super nice and laid back. I really enjoy the atmosphere here, the quality of their food and the drinks are top notch. Win-win-win."

As I do not really drink whiskey, bourbon, or beer, that put me on the cocktail menu. I ordered the Simon + Garfunkel, and the Bubbles + Bramble. Those were some of the strongest drinks I have had since college! In fact, the second drink was so strong I had to send it back to be remade. I am 30-something years old now, and when I go out for dinner with my husband, I&#39;m not looking to get smashed off my face. Even the remade drink was still much stronger than I would normally order. I did not feel like the bartender knew anything about alcohol service. When we asked him some questions about a local beer, he told us he honestly did not know. That seemed to be his answer for most things. 

(By the way, my husband&#39;s drink, the Cucumber Punch, was honestly served with half as much liquid as mine, though it was just about the same punch. I think he was done drinking it in three sips.)

Moving on to the food, I have to say it was some of the worst I have had in a long time. What a huge disappointment! I begged my husband to start with the poutine, which came highly recommended. It was interesting. First of all, it was nearly a trough-full of poutine. it would certainly be enough for eight people, let alone two! The gravy was lacking flavor, and the duck was tough and chewy. I actually asked my husband at one point, do you think this is real duck? We have had some amazing poutine in other restaurants and abroad, and this was not. 

I decided to play it safe afterwards with a turkey burger and mac and cheese. At first, I liked the mac and cheese, but it was served lukewarm, and within minutes, it was cold. I continued to eat it, but as time went on, I realized that I was so desperate to find something to like at this restaurant that I was giving more props to the mac and cheese than it deserved. 

The turkey burger was incredibly average. The meat itself needed more seasoning, with perhaps some red peppers and onions mixed into the meat as well. 

Overall, I would definitely not return for the food, or the drinks, which means I probably will not be returning! What a shame, as I was really looking forward to a new and unique venue in Geneva."

The tap beers were delicious - I had a red and my husband had an IPA.  We chose to share the house plate (meats, cheeses, crackers, jam, pickles), cauliflower, and elote (Mexican corn).  The food was simple and absolutely delicious.  If I made cauliflower like that at home, the kids would gobble it up!  The only disappointment was the cheese on the house plate...it really tasted like nothing compared to everything else.  Our service was a bit lackluster, but overall, a great night out!"

I was hesitant before we went there that our wait was going to be forever.. I read a lot of the reviews and many people were commenting on the long wait since they don&#39;t take reservations. When we got there at 6:30pm on a Friday night they were packed. Not one open table. The hostess said it was going to be an hour, so we went next door for a drink. 20 minutes later we weren&#39;t even done with our cocktails and they had already called us letting us know our table was ready. It was a beautiful night and we were able to sit outside!! 

We tried all the staples. The curds, shrimp and grits, Memphis board, and duck poutine. All were out of this world. I would recommend trying them all. The curds and poutine were my absolute favorites. After we indulged in small plates, we all got entrees. I had the venison burger and it was stellar. Super tasty, juicy, and packed with flavor. The cranberry BBQ sauce on the burger is delightful. I opted for the brussel sprouts instead of the fries and they were well worth it. We also got a side of the Mac and cheese with bacon and it was great as well. 

All in all, everything we tried was packed with flavor and the wait was not an issue. I&#39;ll definitely be back soon!"

My wife and I enjoy eating at the bar in any restaurant that has one  ...  we arrived right on time as a couple walked out. Waited 10min before we were acknowledged as customers, as bartenders walked back and forth talking with customers (there were 3). 

This place is relatively small ... the food was good (we split several items, 5 pepper wings, chili, and chicken sandwich) and drinks were ok (my beer was on the warm side right out the tap - I like my beer cold). My wife always drinks vodka water w/lemon.

Overall, honestly, it was ok, not sure of the validity on previous reviews. Im not knocking this place, just thought it was ok. A month back, My wife and I ate at Wildwood (next door), we&#39;d likely chose the latter over the former. 

We&#39;ll pay extra for quality. 

-tv&#39;s everywhere
-outdoor eating
-compact seating 
-service could be better/attentive/friendlier.

Too many places in Geneva we have not tried to put on our &#34;will return list&#34;."

Had read a lot of reviews saying &#39;go early or expect a long wait&#39;.  We arrived about 5:15 on a Tuesday night &amp; were seated immediately.    The place is dark, fairly intimate and tiny.  Maybe 8 tables inside, 6 or so outside but about 15-20 chairs along the bar.  

The drink menu &amp; food menu are about the same:  4-5 pages and everything looks awesome.  Kelly had the strawberry bellini and LOVED it.  I had a beer since all of the drinks looked really good but I was in a beer kind of mood.  Trying to pace ourselves for the night, we wanted to order nearly all the appetizers but settled on the fried brie curds.  They were AWESOME!  OMG!  I could&#39;ve eaten just those all night &amp; been fine.  The apricot pepper jam was very good with it as well.  Word to the wise:  it is a bit spicy/peppery, but not overwhelmingly so.  Just enough to say &#34;hello vicker&#34; and linger on the palate a while.   

For dinner, Kelly ordered the venison burger with alote&#39; and I ordered the brie burger with brussel sprouts with bacon jam.  Both burgers came out quickly and were very good.  I would&#39;ve liked a lot more pear &amp; brie in my burger though.   The brussel sprouts were very good too, with the best ones at the bottom of the dish.  The venison burger was outstanding.  Stuffed with bacon &amp; blue cheese with a really nice cranberry BBQ sauce.  We shared the burgers &amp; the venison burger was the far better burger.  As we ate, the lady at the table next to us ordered a brie burger as well and she got a TON of brie, so I felt a bit cheated.  I&#39;m not a big alote&#39; fan (kind of a purist when it comes to corn) but Kelly said it was outstanding. 

For dessert, they have house made pies available but you never know what they are until you get there.  We ordered the chocolate chess pie.  We thought it&#39;d be a slice of pie, but NOPE.  Pleasantly surprised to see a small 6&#34; pie come out, with a big dollop of vanilla ice cream  &amp; caramel drizzle.  The chocolate custard in the middle, to me, was very good &amp; tasted a lot like  a fried Oreo.  The ice cream was great as was the caramel drizzle.  The crust on the pie though was a bit too thick &amp; doughy for our liking. 

Service on the night from our waitress, Jordan, was outstanding.  She was always checking on us, getting refills, making suggestions since we were newbies, etc.  

All in all, some minor dings on my burger &amp; the pie, but we enjoyed our first experience here a great deal &amp; look forward to coming back!"

There was about an hour wait for a table which was not an issue since we planned to have a drink before dinner anyway. We sat on sofas in the bar area which was nice, but the sun blasting in through the window made conversation difficult. The blinds could not be closed because of interference from a half-height wall, which could easily be rectified by trimming the blinds! Beer selection was a bit limited with no descriptions offered for the drafts with crazy names having nothing to do with the type of beer. I asked for a Belgium style beer, something a bit on the fruity side. Our waitress made an immediate recommendation making me think she knew what she was talking about, but what I got was an extremely bitter IPA (I do not like IPA&#39;s). We did get our table after an hour so the wait was fine. The burger was tasty but lacking in the amount of (blue) cheese, and it was really greasy, but still tasty. I ordered a cocktail when dinner was delivered and it didn&#39;t arrive until after we were finished. By then I really didn&#39;t want it any more. A bit on the pricey side also for burgers and appetizers and this is not really a place to go for a healthy meal! 

Overall, the place has a nice atmosphere and their &#34;3rd Street&#34; is a nice bourbon cocktail, but just not a place that I&#39;m anxious to return to."

Not to mention it&#39;s also located in downtown Geneva, which is a treasure! For seriously, how did I live in the western burbs without ever visiting this gem of a town? 

In reality, however, this place is just okay. It might be good for drinks or apps, but I think the food overall leaves much to be desired. I went here on my bday (woop woop!) with my boo. We sat at the bar because we are cool dudes with attitudes. The bartenders were friendly and suggested some beer for us to try. We drank the beer and we loved the beer. We ordered the bone marrow appetizer, the Southern, and the Flank sandwich. Let&#39;s break it down:

Bone marrow: Where&#39;s the beef (marrow)? I&#39;ve had bone marrow before, and I&#39;m used to having marrow in the bones. Does this make me a diva? The bones were filled with roasted garlic and onions (I think) which tasted good but was not marrow. 

The Southern: This was the best sandwich of the night, but it was just okay. The syrup threw my boo off. I liked it because it reminded me of bacon without actually having bacon.

The Flank: The meat was good, but it was drowned in chimichurri. And the chimichurri was drowned in parsley. So it was basically like eating a parsley sandwich. Blegh. I like parsley, but I don&#39;t like parsley sandwiches. 

Elotes: We got the elotes as a side dish to one of our sandwiches. I friggin love real elotes: mayo, cheese, pepper, what is not to love??? This was not so good. We barely touched it, it was sweet and off-putting. 

We got fries too. The fries were pretty okay."

Seriously. My husband and I arrived at 7:30 pm on a Friday night and big surprise, they had no tables open. We managed to find 2 seats at the bar and sat down. The pros to sitting at the bar is that your water is refilled pronto since the bartender is right there. We both ordered drinks; a &#34;bubbles &amp; bramble&#34; cocktail for me, and a blood orange margarita for him. The bubbles &amp; bramble can be made with vodka or gin and to be honest, I don&#39;t remember what else is in it. It&#39;s a champagne type cocktail though and pink. I really liked it. It was $10, but strong. Half-way through I was definitely feeling it. My husband enjoyed his margarita, but I honestly couldn&#39;t taste the blood orange at all. Only downside to this restaurant, they didn&#39;t have any mint so they couldn&#39;t make me a mojito. Very easy addition, so I hope they add that on.

Our food....AMAZING. He ordered the rye grilled cheese and I ordered the Southern. The rye grilled cheese was great. The Southern is something that I will probably dream about. From the time I started eating the sandwich to when I finished, anything could have happened. Zombies could have ravaged the restaurant behind me and I probably wouldn&#39;t have noticed (aside from having a chunk bit out of my arm, most likely). I seriously don&#39;t know how long it took me to finish because I feel like time stood still. Ok..maybe it was the effects of my bubble &amp; bramble, but I was just mesmerized by the sandwich. Southern fried chicken with cheese (don&#39;t remember what kind), a fried egg, and maple syrup on a grilled bun. So simple yet so delicious.

My sandwich came with fries, but I opted for the soup instead: corn &amp; bacon chowder.  It was decadent and I&#39;m pretty sure I raved about it for like 5 minutes later. I think my exact words were &#34;I wish they served this chowder in XL bowls&#34;. Yeah, I was in love. Whatevs. The fries my husband had with his grilled cheese were fantastic. I&#39;m not sure what they did to make it taste that way but there must be some sort of coating on it prior to frying.

Only things I would change: more seating (though it&#39;s a small bar, so that&#39;s impossible), lower prices on drinks ($10 is a little pricey for what you get), and mint for mojitos. And 64 oz corn chowder bowls. Or maybe it&#39;s better that they don&#39;t have those."

The dry rubbed siracha and hot wings were to die for. I appreciated the decor and vibe this place has, it reminded me of something that would be in the city. There was a great drink menu, but they were missing a few of my favorite local craft beer brands which was a bummer. Wish the place was a little bit bigger, we were crammed next to a table of rowdy kids (but who brings kids to a place like this??). All in all, we will be back here again and can&#39;t say enough good things about the wings!"

There was literally no where to park for 2 blocks.  Doesn&#39;t anyone work any longer.  Crazy.  Place was almost full.  Ordered from the menu.   Nice options.  Friendly server and the manager greeted us as well.  I tried a new sandwich and had the house salad as the side.  Dishes were nice.  Food was plentiful and the side salad was very good.  I hate to rate this place above average because I feel it will get even more popular and I will never get in again.  It was full on a rainy Wednesday.  In any case food was really good.

Based on the reviews and of course some of the delicious pictures, we thought this was definitely the place we&#39;re banking on and excited to check out. Good news...its even better than could&#39;ve expected! When I say great I mean I struggle to find a negative or room for improvement area. Immediately upon entry to the unique restaurant, we were greeting by who would end up being our waitress. Although a little wait (less than 20 minutes-the restaurant is small, and is telling of the food that there wasn&#39;t a table), we were seated shortly, and greeted again by Jill, who was great!

Our appetizer of hummus, made in house and varying yummy flavors day to day. Served with toasted pita points and crudités. Delish! We then shared both the duck poutine and the southern sandwich with a side of mac and cheese, and again, wow! At first taste it&#39;s clear these folks both know what they&#39;re doing and they execute it well! We ate til we had not a square inch of space left for more, and unfortunately couldn&#39;t then find the room for the homemade desserts, which I&#39;m sure are just as fantastic as everything else we both tasted, and saw others enjoying (also looked fantastic!)

I&#39;ll surely visit again to this establishment, and look forward to trying something new, also likely revisiting some of the deliciousness we had! :)"

However, the host was not so amazing. He had a lackluster attitude when we walked in. Told us the wait was 1 hour and we said ok. He just stood there and stared at us, didn&#39;t say can I take your name. I said well how about any seats at the bar? He said there are some you can do that. So we go to the bar. 5 min goes by and a ton of tables open up. We ask the bartender if we could grab one of those. She gets the host guy. He comes over and says, well I can put your name on the list, it should be 20 min. So we went from a 1 hour wait to 20 min now. He comes back a few minutes later and says oh you can have that table over there.

Here&#39;s how that conversation should have gone: Hi welcome to Barrel + Rye. We have a little bit of a wait right now but I can get you guys seated at the bar. What is your name I&#39;ll get you a table as soon as I can.

No one skipped a beat. The staff remained remarkably cool, service on point and with a smile.. I probably ordered an extra cocktail simply because of the heat. Bourbon peach was refreshing, but my favorite so far is the the Sacred Sage. If you appreciate a good bourbon/ whisky this place is not to be missed. It was too warm for me to sample the extensive whiskey menu. But that just means I need to return. 
As far as food: I tried the Brie cheese curds after seeing them repeatedly raved about. It was with good reason.  I also got to try the fried green tomato special thanks to my bar stool neighbors.  Fried green tomatoes and jalapeño remoulade= exquisiteness."

It doesn&#39;t get a whole lot better than this. Well, unless you go down the street to Burger local which is owned by the same people.

We had a run to Carol Stream to do some after Christmas shopping the Sunday after Christmas. We couldn&#39;t find much around there that was appealing, and decided to come back to Geneva since we have had lock the last several restaurants we went to here, we were not disappointed.

We had tried burger local the day before, and we knew the same owner on this one, so decided to give it a shot.

We were greeted at the door as we walked in, and seated immediately. The host was very friendly. As we came to find out, this was going to be the same with all the staff we met. Our server was at our table within five minutes to take our drink order and our drinks arrived at the table shortly thereafter.

My wife had a standard burger with fries and I decided to try the pork belly. My wife always orders well done ( wife or life of me I can&#39;t figure out) and I medium rare.  Both were prepared to perfection. While we both got fries with ours, I decided I really wanted to try the Brussels sprouts with bacon jam, one of my favorite vegetables.

 the sprouts were on believable. They should be served as an appetizer, there is enough to be as such. They stand very well on their own.

The beer selection look excellent, however we can&#39;t speak to it since right now I&#39;m on some medication that prevents me from trying it. Trust me, I&#39;ll be back.

We now have two excellent choices for lunch or dinner when in Geneva, and luckily they&#39;re owned by the same individual which means the quality and service should be consistent.

Barrel and Rye has a bunch of delicious craft cocktails, an extensive bourbon/whiskey list, and a few beers on tap, as well. Husband and I tried the Blood Orange Margarita, Bubbles and Bramble, and Sacred Sage. They were all delicious but the BOM warranted ordering two. Just saying.

My heart broke D: But we settled for the brie cheese curds, the house charcuterie, and the duck poutine. They were all very, very good. We&#39;ll be back to try that bone marrow, come hell or high water!

Get the brownie too. That shit was quite literally inhaled by us. Mmmm."

Two of those friends had already eaten there and gave it good marks.

We arrived around 5:15 and immediately put our name and phone number on their  list.  The wait at that time was estimated to be a very Bien Truca-ish 1-1/2 hours, so we popped next door to the very excellent bar at Wildwood for some drinks and conversation.

We got called right on time and we&#39;re very glad we caught up at the bar because as soon as we walked into B+R, we were met with a huge wall of sound that made it hard to converse for the rest of our meal and very hard to hear our wait person as she described the menu items.

There were some miscues on the service side that had us waiting for both drinks and apps.  The craft cocktails were rather short pours for the price, but I had an excellent Sazerac that was nicely chilled without being on the rocks.  The charcuterie and hummus apps were pretty good, but I had to remind our server about my roasted red pepper soup which was delivered at the same time as our mains.  It had probably been sitting somewhere ready to deliver as it came out unable-to-eat hot as if it had been popped into the microwave.  Nice roasted pepper flavor though.

Missteps aside, both food and drinks were good and given thumbs up by all, though the food was rather too salty for my taste.

We&#39;ll have to return at least one more time so I can get a roasted bone marrow fix."

Barrel n Rye never disappoints. Atmosphere is cozy, but not tight. There is no better place for brown liquor in the fox valley, and maybe the burbs. House cocktails are very good and the selection of whiskeys is very good. Great tasting food complements the libations. Last night we ordered a plate of their daily homemade pies -- Apple crisp and a chocolate cream.  Both were very good -- the Apple was my favorite (and I am a chocolate lover who normally doesn&#39;t go for apple pie)."

2 hour wait, but worth it.  Great staff, better atmosphere, exceptional food.  Bree Cheese curds, was worth the wait, the &#34;Belly&#34; Hamburger was really well done.  Meaning, great presentation and taste.

Part of a table for 2, it took a bit to get our order taken at the bar and the table reserving process was confusing, but now we know.  The food, service, and the bourbon-based cocktails were all excellent.

Shared the Memphis Sausage plate, which was a good mild yet flavorful sausage smothered in a tangy barbeque sauce, sliced gouda, and a mild gardinera that was made on site.   It didn&#39;t come with crackers or bread-our serve asked if we wanted anything like that but we were good with just our hands and forks.

We also had 8 wings-4 were creole flavored which were great and 4 were 5 pepper which were just o.k.   The wings themselves were a bit dry but they were well cooked (naked wings) and large.  The blue cheese dressing that came with was pretty great and there was a lot of it.

We also split a Black &amp; Bleu burger-cooked a good medium, exactly as ordered and fries were good (even better with the gravy we ordered on top!).

Drink-wise, I had the American Mule (bourbon, ginger beer and lime served over ice in a copper mug).  Talk about refreshing yet just strong enough to remember it&#39;s main ingredient is bourbon!  They have decent tap options as well, but they were out of the 1st two I ordered (1 was out, the other flat per our server, which I appreciated knowing).

Speaking of the server, Diana, she was the type that you&#39;d ask for on your next trip.  Very friendly and attentive, but not the least bit overbearing.  I&#39;ll be back for sure and there were several menu items (bourbon-based and food) that I can&#39;t wait to try."

Unfortunately Barrel &amp; Rye needs to up their game in the food and cocktail department if they want to be in the same league as Sovereign in Plainfield. This was my 2nd visit the first visit being a lunch time burger and fries (the burger was just okay not great). 
Seating is minimal with the majority of the place really setup to dine at the bar which I really dont mind. On a weekend night the place is packed and loud e.g. 1.5 hour wait for a table with nowhere to wait.  Decor is tasteful and comfortable and the dress code is casual. Excellent large HD TV setups as well you can pretty much see well from anywhere in the place. Staff was also professional, quick and courteous.  Beer list was good but the bottle/can list could be larger. Whiskey/Bourbon selection is exceptional and this would definitely be my go to Whiskey bar in the area. That being said the cocktails are definitely lacking. Of the four cocktails I&#39;ve tried only one was really impressive (Sour Earl). With all that whiskey they need some more interesting whiskey cocktail options like Black Manhattan, Paper Plane, Paris Manhattan etc. a standard Old Fashioned and Manhattan should be on the menu as regular items not highlighted like special drinks. The food was equally mediocre considering how interesting the items were the execution did not live up to the description. For example if you&#39;re going to have duck poutine on the menu use duck fat gravy not your regular house gravy it does make a difference. I will probably wait a while and give them a third shot in hopes that they do indeed up their game because I really do love these types of restaurants but if you&#39;re going to do it you need to do it right."

We were told when we got there it would be about an hour and a half wait, just leave you cell number and they call you when your table is ready. There are plenty of places to have a drink or walk through shops so the wait was not a problem as we really wanted to try the place. The staff was friendly and we were seated within the time estimate we were given. The drinks were OK and the food brought to the table in a reasonable amount of time. It is kind of an upscale burger place and this is what we ordered. The burgers were hot the fries were cold. We both had different cheese burgers and both only had a trace of cheese. My wife had the brussel sprouts as a side and they were steamed and very firm. 

All and all a very mediocre dinner not sure I would wait to eat here again."

I ordered the salmon salad and now I crave it. This has to be one of the best salads and salmon dishes I have ever had. On top of great food they also have a good drink menu. Their mixed drinks are their speciality but they also have a nice craft beer menu with the beers constantly changing. This is now one of my go to places in Geneva.

Lots of quaint charm. My best boys picked out this place Barrel + Rye because they know my love of upscale takes on gastro american food and basically the entire menu had our mouths watering. 

We scoured the cocktail menu and let me tell you, it looked good. real good. I settled on a fall themed rum drink that was going to have a burst of citrus freshness, my friend had to settle on an old fashioned (because the place was out of vermouth? please notice this and plan accordingly because you are a whiskey establishment and your server spent precious moments selling us on the amazing sounding cedar manhattan. so sad to have missed that) and my other friend chose a nice crisp fall cider. My drink was about as lack luster as finding some apple juice in the back of the fridge in college and saying what the heck and dumping a bunch of rum into it. Sure I drank it to catch a buzz, but in no way did I enjoy it. The old fashioned was a little sweet, but that comes with the territory and when my friend ordered a second and asked for a little less simple syrup it was absolutely delicious. I ordered their whiskey milk drink for my second round and with bits of cookie it seriously tasted like a boozy rendition of your morning milk after you finished your cinnamon toast crunch ( and I very much enjoyed this). Enough about booze, on to the food. 

The service - The girl was sweet and helpful and I really can&#39;t say anything bad here. 

So.... we were not conservative AT ALL and for the three of us we ordered the duck poutine, wings, bone marrow, a 16 dollar venison burger with what sounded like perfect toppings, a korean bbq sandwich, elotes and brussel sprouts as sides, and pumpkin pie for dessert. 

Duck Poutine - This was delicious. first off it was huge. And the curds and gravy had great flavor. There was a ton of salty well cooked duck, and although I did absolutely drown the entire thing in ketchup it was just because I was enjoying it a lot, a great sharable plate. A+ 

The bone marrow - presented her differently with a TON of roasted garlic on top. I don&#39;t have a boyfriend to kiss so I am not complaining. I enjoyed the bread here and would only say to put about 4 times as much fennel on the plate because it was such a welcome addition and I ate most of it on my one bite before my friends even had a chance. B

The wings - I don&#39;t do wings but the boys seemed to enjoy these dry rubbed wings and I didn&#39;t mind the fact that there was now basically a bottle of blue cheese at the table that I could dip my french fries in because I have absolutely no shame. N/A

The brussel sprouts - the first few bites showed promise and everyone at the table was giving their yums of approval. But a couple sprouts in and the color disappeared and you could tell that these sprouts really needed some more love and time to cook. A worthy effort on the flavor profile, but make sure that side is perfect. C- 

Elotes - my friends and I discovered elotes this year and I am seriously in love. spicy corn covered in cheese and mayo? I can&#39;t even. This one was off the cob and bursting with flavor. My friend was commenting that he detected mint on the dish and I wasn&#39;t sure if he was upset or interested, but if it was the first pass it my way, I was happy to finish it. A+

Korean BBQ - Riding the fence here. This sandwich was ruined by a thick thick bun. I only eat the bottom and I still found it too breadie. Also we noticed on the menu this weird obsession with the bread... categories like &#34;between the bun&#34; &#34;between bread&#34; just seemed a little overkill to us. focus on the flavors, not the brown slab you put it on. The meat was cooked nicely and I would have liked more of that pear slaw to brighten up the dish, it provided a nice freshness. B

and then.... oh the Venison burger. We were discussing how we should order the burger because I would prefer if they bring the animal straight to the table. Barbaric I know, but I love my meat as raw as possible. Then the waitress said &#34;chef recommends medium to medium rare.&#34; Perfect! this was going to be delicious. Well what showed up was a burger so overcooked the bun had completely taken over and the flavor of the cheese and onion was lost because no juiciness remained on this sandwich. And how can you fix an overcooked burger when the kitchen is already closed? If you say you are going to do something chef, DO IT! What a huge disappointment, especially for the price. F 

Pumpkin pie - out comes an entire mini pie COVERED in ice cream. The boys felt it lacked that strong spice but I really enjoyed how simple it was and the buttermilk made it so decadent, even though it wasn&#39;t a thick custard like you normally see from pumpkin pie. If it is the only one I have this season, I will be fine with that. B

All and all pretty good and mostly enjoyable. Until next time Geneva :)"

Being fans of tapas (and no, this isn&#39;t a tapas place), we decided to stick with a multitude of appetizers.  The standard cheese/meat board had a very nice variety to choose from.  The roasted brussel sprouts with bacon were awesome, but were missing that char/crispness that would have taken then to another level.  On a whim, I got the chicharon and it was absolutely delicious.  Crispy with a good dusting of spices, paired with an equally spicy sauce....could sit at the bar with a bar and a basket of those for the day!  To bring the caloric level down a bit, we added just their basic salad which kept pace with the other food.

Beer selection is pretty good, and the house drinks are on point .  My wife had the Moscow mule, while I had the old fashioned.  Both made well with a good balance of their respective ingredients.

The atmosphere is pretty cozy, given the abundance of Edison lightbulbs (adds a great deal of &#34;warmth&#34; to the place).  Our waitress was knowledgeable with the menu and beer selection and was attentive when needed.  We will definitely be going back again....gotta try the bone marrow!"

Got there around 8 pm on a Sunday night without reservations and was told it would be a 25 minute wait. As we were walking around nearby discussing other options, they called to say our table was ready making our wait about 5 minutes instead of 25. 

We were seated at a high top table near the bar, and it was incredibly loud due to the music and bar patrons. Like loud enough that it was difficult to hear across the table and everything was punctuated with a &#34;what did you say?&#34; The interior is nicely decorated though. 

We had wanted to try this restaurant mainly because the Brie cheese curds sounded so delicious and almost immediately we were told they were out for the night, so that was actually a pretty big bummer. The waitress recommended some other appetizers but as a vegetarian, I was pretty limited in what I could eat so we declined. 

For drinks, we had the strawberry cucumber mojito and the Manhattan. Both were good. The mojito could&#39;ve been a little stronger, but the cherries used in the Manhattan were of higher quality than the nasty bright red ones you get at the grocery store so that was a nice touch. 

For entrees, we had the falafel sandwich (me) and the flank steak sandwich (boyfriend). We both got fries as our side. The fries were nicely seasoned but not the best I&#39;ve ever had. The sandwiches were good but I felt like the falafel had a little too much of a kick to it from the chipotle sauce it was served with - I&#39;m not being wimpy about the spice level, but it tasted a little one dimensional like it was just pure heat without flavor. To tamper it down, I stuck some of my fries into the sandwich which worked out well to round it out. 

So, all in all it was fine but not exceptional by any means."

Wait staff recommended favs and I didn&#39;t choose anything among them--instead I chose the chicken sharwarma. It was so full of fat that the meat was inedible. Told the waiter, who took my opinion back to the kitchen; she came back and told me that said dish is made from the thigh so *shrug*..that&#39;s that. Flavor was good though so I ate the veggies and pita that came with it. Portion was way small if you&#39;re comparing it to any other middle-eastern restaurant that serves the same dish. My beer was on the warm side. My daughter had a burger and loved it, so for that reason I will consider going back and listening to the wait staff&#39;s recommendations."

We maxed out. On poutine, on gumbo, on brussel sprouts. I had the Southern, which is a magnificent sandwich of fried chicken and maple syrupness. Oh jeese. I&#39;m in love. Give me more. He had the Black and Blue and it did not disappoint. We waddled home.

The atmosphere isn&#39;t bad for a pub. It&#39;s a very very small place with only a few tables, and it can be pretty loud when it&#39;s full. Strange given that the place is so small.
But onto the food. I tried The Local with smoked Gouda cheese--the 100% grass fed burger, and it was nothing special. The near didn&#39;t have much flavor at all, and the cheese was a joke. It was one slice, and so thin that you could see the burger through the cheese! What kind of cheeseburger is that?!  The fries were cold.

We came on a Saturday night and the place was really hopping. However, they said they would call when our table was ready- so we spent some time wandering around 3rd street while we waited. We were definitely glad we went for a 5:30 pm dinner time as it continued to get busier as the night progressed. 

We started out with drinks- bourbon for our friend, an old fashioned for my husband, and a delicious champagne cocktail. We enjoyed the cheese curds as an appetizer- delicious. My husband had a burger for dinner, and I tried the Southern. It is definitely a unique sandwich- fried chicken, fried egg, and maple syrup. It was very sticky, sweet, and delicious. I&#39;m not sure that it is something that I could eat much in the future- but it was definitely worth trying.

A great spot with a very interesting menu and an even better drink list.  Cool feel in the place and everything I&#39;ve tried from the appetizers to the entrees are great. My favorite thing on the menu is the salmon salad. It&#39;s got fresh pears bacon mixed greens and a healthy portion of salmon! It&#39;s one of the best I&#39;ve had. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for something different.

Then the roasted bone marrow and the duck poutine. Absolutely delicious, only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the duck poutine is so rich it really needs a little salad or slaw for an accompaniment to break the richness. Very glad they got the bone marrow back!"

Great atmosphere for a date or a meet up with a few friends. Recommend 4 or fewer for seating unless you want to sit at the bar. I think there is one table for 6. Overall great little place downtown Geneva. :-)

We checked in with the host for an outside table, and moved to the bar until it was ready. Unfortunately, the host forgot about us. After asking when our table would be ready (we were at the bar for an hour plus), the host attempted to sit us at a very short table outside, which is not conducive at all to eating, particularly with my wife being pregnant. We were then moved back inside. At no point were any apologies given. Again, the food was good and the drink list impressive. However, a restaurant in this price tier is expected to have a level of service that Barrel &amp; Rye did not. We will not be back."

However, I was underwhelmed. The place was crowded, maybe part of the problem is that the service was slow and not the most polite. The temperature was warm, we weren&#39;t sweating, but the air was not working properly. There was no hostess and no sign, a server yelled, sit anywhere and then threw menus at us a couple minutes later, no kids menu even though my son is five. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a side effect of being busy, and maybe over time they work this stuff out. 

As for the food, we ordered the bruschetta, it was good, and it was a large portion. We also had the fried shrimp dinner. The shrimp were huge, the portion was impressive. One shrimp still had its vein, but otherwise, that was a good selection. We also got a pizza, the half cheese portion was really tasty, but the spinach half was yucky. The spinach was off in flavor, almost as if a frozen bag had been thawed and dumped on the pizza. I had imagined fresh spinach, oops. The chicken fingers were good. A mixed bag on the food. I&#39;d go back for more pizza or with a team after a game, but I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll visit for a family dinner again."

But as a guy who has traveled the globe eating at all kinds of taco stands, carts, trucks, and restaurants, this is a hidden gem. The Al Pastor is terrific but the Carne Asada and their Lomo is tops. Excellent chicken tacos too. I also love when the chips are freshly made to order and are perfectly prepared and not oily at all. The salsa verde is great but a little too hot for most.

I didn&#39;t expect the best tasting Chinese but I did expect something semi tasty. I love Chinese food but this place made me sick. 

I ordered the Orange chicken and fried rice, the chicken was dry, the glaze was flavorless and the fried rice tasted like metal. 

My coworker got the Kung pao beef and she threw the entire thing away after a few bites also saying her fried rice tasted like a burnt pan. 

We don&#39;t usually complain but we felt the rice crossed the line it no longer was a question of tasteless it was a question of rice not being suitable to eat! 

We called and explained to the lady our problem with our meal (which costs $10 a person!!!) 

Her response was &#34;that&#39;s the way our rice is supposed to taste&#34;

Next was the Beijing Tofu which was their version of Ma Pao Tofu. The tofu was too firm and should use soft or medium tofu. The meat had a lot of baking soda and corn starch that was strangely deep fried first then thrown into a Very Spicy sauce. I asked for mild but it was very spicy. The hot sauce was very flavorful and seemed homemade."

First off, the guy on the phone was hard to understand, but I got through it almost hassle free. Next, he said the food would be here in 30-35 minutes, it showed up in only 15 minutes... Third issue, we ordered 2 large size dishes, Thai Honey Chicken, and Pepper steak and we ordered crab Rangoon. These were tiny portions, if it were my menu I would specify them as small single portion dinners. The chicken was ok but nothing crazy, the beef was NOT pepper steak it was more like Mongolian Beef but without a ton of onions, instead it had a ton of green peppers and there was hardly any beef. Didn&#39;t taste any pepper... And it was not made right if they dare to call this pepper steak. The crab Rangoon was pathetic, 4 way rolled wonton style with like no crab meat or even cream cheese.. This is a greedy establishment with poor understanding on how to take care of their patrons. First time eating from here, and obviously it has to be the last. Too bad.. I tipped the driver like $10 too.. Never again."

Their Pad Thai is awesome, the best in the area by far. Their are awesome off the menu items, like the fried baby corn and hunan dishes. 

Service is always jovial, though sometimes tact may not be their strongest suit, but it is all in effort to be fun.

Come with a few others and take advantage of trying out a few different items. Appetizers (the crab rangoon, egg rolls, and beef sticks are all great), a few entrees, and they usually throw in some ice cream for a dessert. There is no reason to come home hungry or unsatisfied."

For starters, none of my order came with steamed rice. How do I eat my beef with vegetable or beef with snow peas with no rice?

On top of that, I order a large soup and got charged for a large soup but only recorded a small.

I realized all of this when I got home. I wasn&#39;t really upset as in sure it was honest mistake, I hope, so I decided to call them and let then know, this is the part that really got me upset.

When I called I went through 3 people, no one knew what to do. So finally, the manager offered me a small rice if I came and picked it up? Small rice? I had 2 large order don&#39;t you think you should have the decency to give me at least 1 large order of rice? Anyways, I tried to explain to them that my soup was also a small. She assured me that smit was a large container.... YEAH RIGHT!!! Smallest large container I&#39;ve ever seen. Finally, the lady wouldn&#39;t even let me speak,  she was rude and disrespectful. She told me if I want something she will credit a large rice to my account...... YES, let me drive out there for a large steamed rice. 

Pretty sad business. Went in there 6pm on a Sunday, no customers sitting at the tables. The employees were sitting in a circle and stating at me when I walked in as if I interrupted their free time. I&#39;ll be surprised if these guys stay open much longer. Small portions, high prices, and super shitty service is a recipe for disaster. Good luck, but there are plenty of genuine Chinese pleases that really care that their customers return."

Not just is the good always good, but the servers are friendly without being slow and they make an effort to be sure you&#39;re enjoying your dining experience. 

I may be a bit biased as a regular, but honestly places like Hunan Beijing are super rare these days. While I&#39;ve had the benefit of so many years to get to know the staff, I&#39;ve felt like their most valued customer since the first time I ate there before going to see the Lion King at Woodfield.

I base my Chinese restaurants on their fried rice and egg rolls. First of all the fried rice was one of the best I ever had it was not soggy like some of the others in other restaurants their was an abundant amount of chicken which was cooked just right not dry but tender and juicy the bean sprouts were crisp and the soy sauce content was enough to enhance the fried rice. Egg rolls were light and crisp and delicious.

Normally, I check a place out before hitting submit.  This time I gambled and ordered before reading the reviews.  Not going to lie...I was nervous after reading so many negative reviews.  

Well.  I can just say my experience was wonderful.  They were super speedy!  It was under 30 minutes from the time I ordered to when I was eating.  And the food.  WOW.  First off - it&#39;s not jarred sauce.  Or, if it is, they jazz it up enough that you can&#39;t tell.  I had orange chicken (medium spiciness) and it had a delightful spicy tingle.  Plus you could tell it was actual pieces of chicken and not the frozen, prebreaded nuggets you get so often.  My friend got the cashew chicken and kept going on about how good it was.  And it did look quite tasty!

The only reason they got dinged is because the fried rice was a little bland.  Not a huge crisis - we just ended up adding soy sauce.

All in all - a place I will definitely order from again!"

It was our first time trying Hunan Beijing and the lady on the phone was very thorough in making sure she got all of our information &amp; our order correct.

Food arrived 8:40 which was good timing. The delivery man was nice. Now, on to the food! The chicken pieces in their dishes are long &amp; skinny as opposed to nugget shaped smaller sizes from other places. 

The sweet and sour chicken was great...the sauce was separate from the chicken and what I loved is that all the vegetables were not in the sauce. I hate tomatoes and peppers and often places will put the veggies in the sauce making the whole sauce taste like them. I loved that they put the veggies in with the meat as it didn&#39;t taint the sauce flavoring! 

The walnut chicken had a honey type of sauce to it. The chicken pieces in this were moist but the sauce was very thin. It was tasty, I just wish there was a bit more of it and it had some thickness to it. It came with a healthy amount of walnuts and broccoli which was good.

The last dish we got was Honey Thai Chicken. It wasn&#39;t what I was expecting at all. I didn&#39;t get the honey flavor much - it was pretty bland. Tons of veggies. Not worth the $12 at all when the much better small sizes S&amp;S chicken and walnut chicken were about $7 each and the same size.

This place didn&#39;t blow me away. I will give it another try with different dishes but  my search for the best Chinese food in the northwest burbs continues. I miss my north burb Chinese places! =P"

My experience at Hunan has been hit-or-miss.  My wife and I get the same variation of foods off-and-on at Hunan; sometimes dining-in and sometimes ordering-out.  Normally (say 80% of the time), the food is out-of-this-world good and the service is excellent, but on occasion the food is out-right inedible.  

Today was a day where the food was absolutely tasteless, bland and just plain wrong.  It was so tasteless and bland that I added homemade sauces to spice things up.  On top of that, midway through, my wife and i noticed we were eating Lo-Mein Noodles when we had ordered Pad-Thai.  I called the restaurant to point out the error (and I NEVER send food back or complain), and the response was outright dismissive and unapologetic.  Come to find out, the normal &#34;noodle chef&#34; is out on Thursdays, so if I were you and today is a Thursday, and you were thinking of getting any noodle dish....I would reconsider and think about getting something else. 

Otherwise, the food is really good.  Just not sure I can go back again due to this experience.  Simple customer service would have kept me going back.  Now, they have lost a good customer."

Our favorites (and it&#39;s hard to narrow it down) are the Pad Thai, Governor&#39;s Chicken, and the Crab Rangoon.

-They are super fast!  My in-laws live in their delivery area and after calling in their order the food is there in 10 minutes!!  Amazing.

I&#39;m pretty sure the lords of garlic work in the kitchen here, because everything that I&#39;ve had has been super-garlicky.  Ask for less garlic if you don&#39;t want to offend everyone within 15 feet.  
Governor Chicken, Dragon &amp; Phoenix, chow meins, lo-meins, all ok tasting.  Good portion size for the small option and huge for the large.  Watch out for the beef...it&#39;s occasionally stringy.  I&#39;ve only gotten occasional gristle in my chicken, but that&#39;s a terrible thing to bite into.  The shrimp are usually good.  
I&#39;ve only ever done carryout there, but the inside is quaint and nice looking.

All of the above was terrible no flavor, shrimp fried rice was under cook rice was hard and grease, Pork egg foo young pork was old and gravy was old, the Beef Pad Thai , beef was old, tuff and there was a taste of sweetness not usually found in PAD THAI.

I came here the other night with my mom for dinner and it was confirmed. I&#39;m an Asian food snob. I just don&#39;t consider other &#34;Chinese&#34; restaurants any good. They think grease equals flavor. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m sure Hunan B. uses oil to cook their food as well, but they make things taste good -with spices! Can you believe that newfangled technology they call...SPICES? Yeah, it&#39;s really good here. I just like how they buck tradition and have some unique things on the menu for veggie friendly people that I haven&#39;t seen on other menus. At other places, my &#34;stand by&#34; is egg foo young and after about 20 years, that gets boring. I&#39;m so happy I can order my fave tofu or eggplant dish here. Also ask for a special, non-menu item called scallion cake. Not sure how to describe it -it is like a big flat piece of dough fried with scallions. It is really, really good. I just wish there was a location closer so when the mood strikes, I can order delivery. But, it&#39;s OK. I guess that makes this place more special since I have to wait to go there!"

Tonight we joined several old friends, and made a few new ones along the way, here for  dinner. We were greeted warmly by several of the employees and given a great table from where we could watch everything going on in the restaurant. Our waitress, Betty was a rock star! she was efficient, yet reminded me of a mom always asking if we were ok. When the little one spilled his drink, it was no problem. We wiped it up and presto, we had another drink, this time with a lid on it. Appetizers were delish, the shrimp toast one of the best ever! Crab rangoons, filled perfectly and fried just right. Even the munchkin liked them, (these folks are truly kid friendly...not just an act, but then our little one is really a good kid..lol) . When it came time to order dinner, I wanted something different and told Betty to leave it up to the kitchen, as long as it wasn&#39;t too spicy. They brought out a pork dish that was incredible! Tender slices of pork, a savory sweet sauce, onions, cellophane noodles....yum, yum!  The rest of the dishes were equally tasty, even the sweet and sour chicken had a nice little twist to it! For dessert the fried bananas and vanilla ice cream was a perfect ending. From what every one else told me the mai-tais were damn tasty ( I was the DD), and I had their house tea, amazing...it needed no sugar, which is a lot for me! Definitely will be heading back  here soon, so watch out Betty as Arnie would say  &#34;We;ll be back!&#34;"

I grabbed the Mongolian Chicken special with fried rice and an eggroll. In general I thought it was seasoned really well, and it helped that the green onions still had a good bit of crunch in them by the time I was able to eat it. The eggroll was wrapped in a very thick wonton wrapper, and the fried rice was clumped up nicely and seasoned nicely as well. My only possible complaint is that it was a tad greasy.

I get the impression that they&#39;ll be a good place to go for consistently good Americanized Chinese food, but I&#39;m curious to see what the specials taste like. When I find out, I&#39;ll definitely post an update."

I was in and out of there in roughly 20 minutes. Soup came, then the appetizer, then the entree, then the check - all within 10 minutes time. Put my debit card down and zing was out of there as soon a moment after I finished. So I was happy with that - picked the place over the burger place next door speculating the burger place might take longer - I was probably right about that.

As for the food though, honestly it was so/so. Chicken noodle soup was like a miso with thin rice noodles and some chicken - ok. Eggroll was good, but the hot mustard had a heavier than usual vinegar taste to it - I had to scrape some off. Mongolian beef was ok - I&#39;ve had better and worse. Came with fried rice which seemed a little dry - would have preferred steamed rice but wasn&#39;t asked, and didn&#39;t think to ask myself.

Value was decent - soda is in cans and are not bottomless - $1.25 each. My tab was $10.50 plus a $2 tip - easy to digest. Looks like they do have some authentic dishes available - don&#39;t see too many places with a variety of congee - but they&#39;ve got it. Would try again if in area looking for fast Chinese food.

The food is really authentic and very well priced. Everything I have had there has been really great - salt and spicy pork, mongolian beef, chow fun noodles with beef/broccoli (I do ask for gravy, the one without gravy is a bit bland), wonton noodle soup, beef fried rice, and their egg rolls are awesome (they are an add on to their lunch specials). 

My husband loves their fried rice (he would call himself a friend rice connoisseur so that&#39;s a high rating for him). He also enjoys their chow fun, you can&#39;t get it the way they make anywhere else in the suburbs. 

Their wonton noodle soup definitely hits the spot when it&#39;s cold and snowy out. I did get the beef noodle soup once and felt that there was too much fatty beef parts that I didn&#39;t enjoy as much. 

Their lunch specials are a great deal and can feed you with some leftovers for dinner. Also if you want to go during lunch, they get quite busy and it may be hard to find a spot. Definitely worth taking out if you really want good Chinese food."

It is not  a fine dining place and it is not exclusively a take out place.  Hong Kong is in between the two and a little bit of both.  Of course they do have take out as an option but during the lunch hour many people come to eat in.  The set up is simple with basic chairs and tables that seat four to six people per group.  

Upon arrival you are offered green tea and hot and sour soup.  Both are excellent and slightly unexpected given the simplicity the restaurants atmosphere conveys.  Again, the interior decor and set up of this place you would expect your food to come in Chinese take out box but Hong Kong Cafe is far from that.  The menu is extensive and the dishes are exceptional.  You can gather this from the authenticity of the menu items as well from the majority Chinese patrons that frequent this location.

We&#39;ve only done take-out so far - really need to eat there to get the full experience.

We ordered and were told it would be about 20 minutes. So, we waited a few, then went to go pick it up. It was not ready when we arrived, and they were very apologetic. They had several large parties, and it is a fairly small place, so we understood. They seated us at a table to wait. While waiting, we watched people around us, and saw lots of different foods we want to try.

In particular, there was a fabulous looking dish I had to ask about. They explained it was a full fried chicken which you have to order a day in advance - next time. There was also a bitter melon omelet that looked fantastic.

What we ordered turned out to be great too. The Sweet and Sour soup was among the best I&#39;ve had. Together, we ordered the soup, chicken and Chinese broccoli, Hot and Spicy Chicken and Vegetables and Bitter Melon and Pork Ribs in Casserole. Because we had to wait a short time, they gave us a Pork Fried Rice for our trouble. So nie of them. Because, the fried rice was outstanding.

So, next time, we order the whole fried chicken a day before we go, and we will dine in rather than carry out."

their egg rolls are great, everything&#39;s honestly really good. but they aren&#39;t exactly the deep-fried junky Americanized Chinese food specialists--definitely eat here if you&#39;re looking to try something new and painstakingly prepared. the prices are a huge bargain, especially for all the labor that goes into what they&#39;re serving (seriously, get on that congee)."

The food is pretty cheap (especially the lunch specials). All of the lunch specials are under $7 and come with rice, a fortune cookie, and soup of the day. I was sad that they didn&#39;t have egg drop soup, so I ordered the hot and sour soup instead. It was hot...and sour. Not my favorite, but that&#39;s a personal preference. Our meals were pretty good. Their fried rice is not my favorite (no veggies and a ton of soy sauce). The noodles were great, and the kung pao beef was good. Everything came out piping hot. Their menu is HUGE (most items are just listed without descriptions), so you are bound to find something.

Inside is very colorful, and they have Chinese television shows on (I think the one we were watching was like a soap opera). The service was SO fast at first. Our food came out ridiculously fast...like...almost scary fast. And then our server never came back. Finally they came to get our payment.

So for the haters, this is authentic asian cafe food. If you go to hong kong this is very similar to the food you get from the diners for lunch. There are many americanized items, but this is very similar to HK fast food scene. The beef chow fun was well cooked with plenty of flavors. Not too salty and there appeared to be no MSG. The rest of the menu is a mixture of rice, noodle, etc dishes. Prices are good and servers are friendly and fast. The only detracting value is the dingy bathrooms which is typical of Hong Kong diner type restaurants so I guess it adds to a the authentic value. Another thing missing would be combo meals that would come with hot milk tea which would be very authentic. Oh well

Pro: inexpensive, great canto diner food

Cons: dirty/dingy bathrooms

Hidden gem: Lunch special for better savings"

It offers good radish cake on weekend and reasonable rice and noodle dishes.  I would have given it a 4 stars, if their service measures up to their food.  The servers can be cold and moody.

Although the cafe is small, it isn&#39;t tightly packed. There is definitely enough room between neighboring tables so that you do not feel like you are constantly bumping elbows with strangers.

If you are looking for a place to get in and out quickly with a belly full of authentic Chinese food, this is the place for you! 

Our table ordered the cha siu pork, the sautéed chinese broccoli, and a fried turnip cake (a weekend special) to share. I also ordered a bowl of shrimp dumpling noodle soup to split with my mom. I loveeedd the cha siu as well as the fried turnip cake. I only had a little bit of both because they are both cheat foods for me, but they were delicious!! If I had a little less restraint, I&#39;m sure I could have downed both orders and then some.

 The turnip cake is lightly battered and deep fried, leaving the center moist. I also appreciated that the each piece of cha siu was heavily glazed with cha siu marinade. I hate it when I get that piece of cha siu that is super dry, tough to chew, and flavorless, but the cha siu here is none of the above! I really enjoyed the shrimp dumpling noodle soup as well. The flavors reminded me of home and the shrimp wontons that my nanny used to make when we were growing up. You really wouldn&#39;t believe how quickly I slurped up the noodles and the soup!!

The decor was not really anything to look at but you if are typical Chinese, you are there for the food and not the decor. The food was great and comparable to what you would fine in a local Chinese restaurant. Another good clue that you would know the food is good is see how many Chinese are eating there.

In fact, not once did they ask how we enjoyed the food.  The entire time we were here, they didn&#39;t fill up a single glass.  I didn&#39;t even see a pitcher.

Now I would suggest any regular rice dishes, chow mien items (so-so), well their chef specials are great as well there are pictures on the menu so it makes it so easy if you are non Chinese and don&#39;t know what those dishes are.

I am Cantonese grew up in HK so I would say I know how Cantonese food should be cooked. It wouldn&#39;t be the same food you have in HK cause the ingredients here VS there are sort of different. 

Bottom line you can give this place a try if you want some Chinese food in the suburbs . This is more of Cantonese style, so go to some where else if you want Lao Sze Chuan spicy dishes.

I know!). So, we decided to hop on our recently tuned-up bikes and bike over to somewhere nearby that we haven&#39;t been to yet. Hong Kong Cafe was our destination.

You know how you can tell an ethnic restaurant must be good if many people of that certain ethnicity are dining there? This was one of those places. Nearly every table was full of Chinese families and friends. We kind of stuck out like sore thumbs (especially because every was watching us park our bikes outside), but the staff immediately approached us with warm smiles and cool glasses of water. I also got a pina colada bubble tea that tasted amazing and had a generous amount of tapioca balls (writing this review right now is tempting me to finish so I can go back and one now!).

The food we ordered arrived rather quickly. My husband loved his chicken fried rice. My mixed vegetables with tofu was kind of a disappointment. The veggies were good but they were few in a large plate of abundant, soft, tasteless tofu. The overwhelm of icky tofu caused me to dislike my meal. I let my server know and she suggested that next time I ask for the tofu to be flavored and fried -- it&#39;s much better. Apparently I wasn&#39;t the only one who had that opinion about it. I believe her and I&#39;m glad she gave me that tip (but why couldn&#39;t they have just done it that way the first time around?). 

This was a great hole-in-the-wall that left us pleasantly surprised. Minus a star for the icky tofu but I&#39;m sure it will be bumped up the next time I&#39;m here."

My dad and I, who have both traversed China on separate occasions, agreed on this.


We ordered:
1. Deep-fried shrimp appetizer with some apricot sauce (dad loved it)
2. Ma Po Tofu (HEAVENLY)
3. Hot &amp; spicy vegetables (good, but the veggies were rock-hard)
4. Beef chow fun (dad loved it; said it was even better the next day, haha)


Cool:
1. Chocolate fortune cookies!
2. Picture menu
3. Decor rocks


What held this back from being a 5-star review:
1. Hot and Sour soup was $5.75! Unless I get the whole pot, I&#39;m not paying that much. I&#39;ve never seen that soup for more than $3.
2. Tea is not complimentary.
3. I don&#39;t think our server said a word to us the entire time.
4. My water wasn&#39;t refilled even after I asked. I had two spicy dishes that I still put more chili oil on, so my mouth was on fire by the end of my meal... and my cup was empty. :(


I would go back in a nano-second. One bite, and I was instantly transported back to some of my favorite hole-in-the-walls in Beijing and Tibet. Super cool. :))

The first time we had the Black Pepper Beef Short Ribs and it was great. The deep fried bread was ok. That visit merits three stars but the second visit doesn&#39;t. 

Roast pork (Char Siu) and roast duck are Cantonese staples and they can make or break a Cantonese place for me. I am afraid Hong Kong Cafe did not deliver. The color of the roast pork was off (too red) and meat was a bit dry. The roast duck didn&#39;t have the crispy skin and meat was bland. They sat on top of a plate of rice haphazardly splashed with pure soy sauce--what happened to my meat juice? You know, the french ain&#39;t the only people who does the au jus thing. And I do miss a few stems of Chinese broccoli adorning my rice plate. 

Had a bite of the vegetable egg roll and found the skin too thick, cabbage filling boring and inside slightly doughy. The fish fillet congee (available on weekends only) was just a faint reminder of one of my favorite comfort foods. The texture of the congee (rice porridge) was not bad, but the wrong kind of fish ruined it. Perhaps I should have tried the preserved egg (not sure who started calling it thousand-year old egg but it was pretty ignorant IMHO) and pork congee, which is in fact the most popular congee among Cantonese folks.  

By now I should probably mention Cantonese food is very dear to me so I tend to give somewhat harsh criticism when it&#39;s not done right. I am sure there are things they do right but I will need to find an excuse to come back and find out, maybe for the tapioca freeze treats...

In the meantime the search for good Cantonese food is on."

There are a lot of Asian restaurants in the area but many of them are not worth my time, so I am excited to finally have a new one to add to my list. We tried to come on a Monday and found it was closed on Mondays, so we returned a couple days later to give it a shot. Walking in, I was greatly encouraged by the fact that nearly all the patrons were Asian -- a good sign.

There are just 10 or so tables in this small restaurant but the environment is very nice, clean, and relatively up-to-date, much better than the average strip mall restaurant. The service was quick and friendly. 

I ordered the General Tso&#39;s Chicken (not real Chinese food, I know) and my wife ordered Mongolian Beef. Her beef was absolutely succulent and not covered in sauce like it tends to be in other places. My General Tso&#39;s had what I always look for first -- crispy breading. This is rare, particularly in suburban restaurants, so this is a big win for Hong Kong Cafe. On the downside, the flavor was not quite what I expect from this dish. As such, I would not order this particular item again, but would happily order plenty of other things from the menu.

The lunch specials were perfectly sized: plenty of food but not a mountain of it. The hot and sour soup I got with it was delicious and perfect. At only $6 a piece, the price is great.

I brought my 2 year old son along, who had a chicken/egg/corn soup that was pretty tasty. I liked that they gave him a proper kids sippy cup with a straw that didn&#39;t spill, a rarity from any restaurant.

This is tied with House of Pho as my new favorite Asian restaurant in the Schaumburg area!"

This update is about their pricing, more specifically, the discrepancies in the prices listed and what is actually charged. 

They do not input their orders into a computer so the tab is susceptible to error. Lately we&#39;ve noticed that our bills have been a tad bit more expensive than what we expected based on what&#39;s listed on the menu. Had this happened only once, I would have chalked it up to mere human error. Hey, anyone can make a simple mathematical error. But when it&#39;s happened the last four times, I start to suspect maybe something is up. Each time, I&#39;ve had to literally go over our order and reference the menu price with the person who took my order (it&#39;s been the same lady each time). Each time, she&#39;s found that&#39;s she&#39;s made an error. She doesn&#39;t offer an apology but merely scratches off the old price and scrawls in the new price.

The &#34;errors&#34; have been generally between ~ 80 cents to ~ $1.25. That may not seem like much, but that adds up if you order from here frequently. Look, there&#39;s no concrete evidence that the restaurant is doing anything illicit. It could just be that the person who took my order is simply bad at entering the correct prices into a calculator. But again, it&#39;s starting to smell a little fishy when it&#39;s happened the last four times, and when the price discrepancy is just small enough to be negligible -- maybe they think that nobody will check since the price is in the ballpark and the bill is tabulated by hand, often in handwriting that&#39;s difficult to read. All I&#39;m saying right now is double check your bill. It doesn&#39;t take very long, and it could very well save you some money."

Today the day after Thanksgiving I place a order at 430pm. I get there and the place is empty pay for my food and go. When I get home my order is wrong. I call them tell them I ordered beef with garlic sauce but got chicken with garlic sauce. They tell me your order says chicken....Like its my fault they took it down wrong. I even repeated my order on the phone to make sure this wouldn&#39;t happen. So sorry there are tons of places to get Chinese food don&#39;t need horrible service.

I visited here with the boyfriend and his family who are Chinese and knows quite a big about Canton and Hong Kong dishes and they have been fond of this place. Luckily, when I&#39;m with them, his family always order a plethora of dishes and being that it was my first time at the restaurant, it really gave me a good idea of the many dishes that they offered.  

We had a fantastic luncheon that felt more like a feast with beef and seafood congee, beef chow fun, 2 kinds of rice rolls in soy sauce and XO sauce, hot and sour soup, turnip cake, wonton thick rice noodle soup. 

The chow fun and rice rolls were really flavorful and it didn&#39;t look like any other chow fun you would get from other cook-cutter Chinese restaurants.  It was not too soft nor hard and had the right about amount of a bit crunchy-ness to it.  Though with fried noodles, you will get a bit of oil and this restaurant will use oil.  But I guess that comes with the food.  

The congee soup was very good and it was made Canon style so the rice was more fluffy than other congees.  Just have a taste of it if you&#39;re looking for something warm to start with and you&#39;ll see what I mean.  The hot and sour soup was good but I must say it tasted a bit more sweet than it was sour.  Every place makes it different and they just need to adjust the balance.  

Turnip cakes was yummy and wonton soup was delish...  Overall, I was pretty satisify with this place and I would visit again.  The food is good though the service can bit a little abrupt but they&#39;ll get your order out quick (which is pretty accurate of most local small-business restaurants). Pictures to follow..."

It reminded me of Chinatown and I think it&#39;s the closest to Chinatown food I have ever found in the burbs!

My meal started with the hot &amp; sour soup which is VERY spicy! I was proud of myself &amp; my sensitive taste buds for having as much as I did. It has some tofu in it and something we couldn&#39;t quite identify but thought maybe it was eggplant? I found that to be an interesting selection.

Then we ordered the fried bread thanks to the yummy looking picture a fellow Yelper posted. It was a good addition at $3.30. It was steaming hot, lightly deep fried and just tasted so moist and appetizing. I loved it! 

I added the egg roll to my lunch special...not necessary at all with the HUGE amount of food we got but I really wanted to give it a try. I consider myself to be an eggroll connoisseur and can never seem to find the perfect one. I would venture to say that this might just be the best eggroll I&#39;ve ever had! No joke! It wasn&#39;t overly deep fried, came out of the deep fryer nice &amp; hot. I loved the crispiness of the outside. It was a very thick eggroll filled with a lot of tasty ingredients on the inside. It cost an extra $1.25 to add to my meal but it was well worth it!

For my main entree, I ordered the sweet &amp; sour lunch special with white rice (it comes standard with fried rice). It was just a bit over $6 and was a huge portion. The chicken pieces were very large and moist compared to other places. The sauce was the Chinatown standard...orange and saucy! It wasn&#39;t overly amazing but still good. My friend got the beef chow fun which I tasted. Now that was amazing!

We were one of just a few tables in there for lunch. The service was very friendly, much better then the standard Chinatown which I keep comparing this lunch to. Food came out very fast which was perfect for our lunch. We have an hour for lunch...it took us 10 minutes to get here, 10 minutes to get back to work, and in that 40 minutes we had soup, appetizer, side dish, main dish &amp; chocolate fortune cookies...didn&#39;t go over on our time at all! Definitely will be coming back here!"

Very clean, bright modern accents &amp; droning AsianTV white noise seems to fit a place where we are there to EAT, not talk. A-OK. 
Very well lit, bright accent colors and solid industrial aluminum chairs.
This is a lunch review only. 

$6.50 for spicy veggie, tip &amp; tax included; SO fast my veggies were undercooked even by MY standards and that is how I liked them I thought. I think they just threatened them with some hot soy sauce. Tea included, they may have to like you for a 3rd cup. 
Hot &amp; sour a little vinegary, no leftovers except for way too many raw green peppers. I&#39;m working through their lunch specials and will update. The chocolate fortune cookie is growing on me and kind of fun.
If you have a large party you may want to take a little extra time to decipher that cryptic bill, they round UP.

Inside was a cozy looking little place with a real family vibe- tables shoved in every nook and cranny, and a Lcd TV hung on the wall which was blasting Chinese news. I must have wandered in just before they opened for dinner as I saw the staff; or perhaps their family; or perhaps both, chowing down in front of the TV. I was seated politely and given a menu. Having been a fan of wonton gourmet for a while, I was excited to see noodles and dumplings with Chinese broccoli on the menu. Promptly ordered. They were fantastic!! The dumplings were quite a bit better than wonton gourmet&#39;s, and the Chinese broccoli was cooked just right. Try the scrambled egg with bitter melon- it also has crunchy, salty, tubers inside. The Hong Kong style iced tea was also amazing. If you&#39;re looking for a high end place, this ain&#39;t it, but for quality grub with a home cooked taste this is your spot. Lotta things here you would be hard pressed to find on a menu elsewhere, as well. And not too expensive either. To me, this place is really a gem for this area."

So I totally pussed out and ordered tame items like the sesame chicken. The portions are huuuge! And it&#39;s of good quality for the price. Too bad the lunch menu ends early; I&#39;m not always in the mood for gargantuan portions. The broccoli tastes great. And I HATE broccoli. That tells you something about how well their flavors blend.

When you dine inside, you get your drinks in a plastic cup, and the owners are sitting in the corner watching TV. It makes me feel like I&#39;m at someone&#39;s house.

The hot and sour soup was pretty good and the pot stickers were even better this time - I tried to get half an order as they&#39;re big and 6 is close to eating dinner instead of appetizers but they wouldn&#39;t accomodate me so I sucked up all the willpower I could muster and eat only 3 of the 6. This time I ordered a Cantonese style chow mein with chicken and chinese broccoli. I was still finishing my soup and working on the pot stickers when the chow mein appeared but the noodles was steaming hot so it was good that I was still working on soup and appetizers to give it time to cool down. The noodles were excellent except I would have liked it a bit crisper as the noodles are the bottom layer so the chicken, vegetables and sauce will soften up the noodles. All in all, hasn&#39;t changed my opinion of 4 stars for the food. The service is definitely not four stars as they are literally order takers and food servers but maybe they&#39;re more pleasant with the Chinese speaking crowd (of which I am not a member).

I ordered string beans with garlic, which was not on the menu, but which they graciously (and perfectly) cooked for me. We also got the orange chicken - not my idea. It was head and shoulders above what you normally get when you order this dish, gingery and delicious. 

Based on yelp, I got the beef chow fun in black bean sauce. It was delicious, but the noodle were thick rice noodles, where I was expected wide, flat noodles (like Pad See Eiu noodles). A little disappointing, but still delicious.

In a 10 star system, I&#39;d give them 6 stars (or slightly above average). In a 5 star system, I want to give them 3.5. At the end of the day, I will give them 3 stars because they don&#39;t quite reach the &#34;price/value&#34; relationship because of my perceived higher prices from them.

PROs
- The quality of their food is really good. I&#39;ve had their spicy fried fish. They keep the outside of the fish crunchy and the inside tender. They also use green onion, pepper flakes, and salt on the outside to make it super tasty.
- Their fish fillet in white sauce is really tasty. If you&#39;re looking for something to balance out beef, chicken, or vegetable dish, I&#39;d recommend this dish.
- Their Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce tastes great. There is a great mix of flavor between the broccoli and the garlic.

CONs
- Their dishes are rather pricy for Chinese food in the area. Most of their dishes range from $9-13. I know that&#39;s in the medium range. For my taste, I always have second thoughts when I&#39;m debating which dish to get because it just barely pushes me into that range where I wonder if it&#39;s worth it.
- They got my order wrong so I ended up with fried fish instead of the fish in white sauce, but it still tasted good.
- The ambiance is nice. It has a TV screen showing some Chinese TV in the back. The service is pretty good.

My only big hesitation about this place is it&#39;s priced a bit higher than some other Chinese places in the area. Other than that, it&#39;s definitely worth going in a big group where you can try lots of dishes."

It was so good, that my sister-in-law and her boyfriend didn&#39;t want to give it back after they tried mine.

The portions were very large, and sauces were light. Even the &#34;Americanized&#34; dishes (General&#39;s chicken and beef with broccoli) were made with more of an authentic flair.

Parking was fine, and prices weren&#39;t exactly dirt cheap ($70 for 3 apps, 6 entrees, and two drinks), but for the authenticity, portion size, and quality of food, I&#39;d pay it again in a second."

The portions are great here too, which is a must for me, because I&#39;m all about value and I love having leftovers to take home with me.  

The only thing I didn&#39;t care for, is that they use plastic cups.  I think that&#39;s pretty nasty and tacky for a restaurant.  I&#39;ve never eaten at a sit-down place that uses plastic cups, but since the food is so tasty, I can overlook that.

This is the best Chinese food in the burbs, very authentic,. It definitely has that Chinatown feel with it being family run and the TV always tuned to some Chinese channel.  I am a crazy fan of congee and here they serve on weekends ( I usually order extra to hold me until the next weekend).  Gotta try the braised noodles with shrimp dumpling, spicy salty pork chops and combination fried rice.  You&#39;ll thank me  and you&#39;re welcome.

Just like how you&#39;d get chow mein in Chinatown, except in the burbs.  There are very few places in the burbs as good, especially out in Schaumburg.  

I prefer this place over Yu&#39;s simply because I prefer Cantonese style food, but that&#39;s just my preference.  Ping&#39;s is good too, just also a different style all together.

Fried fish, congee, noodles are spot on.  It&#39;s pricier than Asian Noodle House, but at ASN you get what you pay for.  If you want larger portions and more importantly a dish with generous meats and veggies, this is your place.

Get the fried dough to go with your congee.  Their fried dough isn&#39;t the typical one&#39;s I&#39;ve had, but it&#39;s better."

Let&#39;s start with the positives....cute little cafe type of restaurant...cozy, clean, warm colors inside.  The wait staff was warm and friendly and were helpful with menu choices....

The negatives...the food was OK....not anything to really complain about, but then again, nothing to really rave about.  Portion size was pretty small compared to other Chinese places.  I would say that I could get twice as much for the same price.  

Being that my family is from Hong Kong,  I say that I would stick to my trusty Chinese picks on our list:  Wonton Gourmet in Des Plaines and Oriental Taste out in the Willowbrook Area for my Cantonese style noodles and Hong Kong cafe / diner food."

Hong Kong Cafe is intimate and unpretentious and does not act like the typical Chinese restaurant, preferring instead to place its focus on the food. The wonderful wonderful food.

First of all, the crab rangoons are top notch - lightly crisped on the outside &amp; fresh, flavorful cream cheese on the inside really elevated this particular (nontraditional) appetizer.  My girlfriend and I then split an order of curry chicken and an order of Cantonese BBQ Beef over chow mein, both of which were extremely well done. The curry flowed thick over the chicken while the BBQ Beef sauce, if not as sweet as I would have hoped, moistened the crispy noodles just enough and settled the dish into a harmonious equilibrium.

Hong Kong Cafe is the embodiment of the ancient Chinese proverb that &#34;to the ruler, the people are heaven; to the people, food is heaven.&#34;"

Potstickers - pricey but with vinegar and soy sauce are to die for. Cooked to perfection each time I have had it.
Noodle dishes - you can pretty much have any meat cooked with any type of noodle here and even soupy. All the ones I have been lucky enough to try have been completely finished off.
Congee - just like how I remember it when I was young - great!

This meal was more like an audition, to be added to my work lunch list.  Started things off right with some hot &amp; sour soup, which had a nice kick to it, and some tasty fried bread.  I&#39;ve always seen chinese fried bread on various menus, but never thought to try it.  Piping hot balls of perfectly fried dough, crispy outside and soft inside.  They weren&#39;t oily at all and had a slight sweetness.  Next were some egg rolls, fresh out of the kitchen.  They had a thin crispy shell, which I really enjoyed.  The main event was some beef chow fun w/ black bean sauce &amp; chinese broccoli.  Now I love me some beef chow fun from chinatown... mmm greasy beefy goodness.  HKC&#39;s version was a nice alternative with a generous portion of fresh ingredients and perfectly pan fried rice noodles.  Plus you get a complimentary chocolate dessert in the form of a fortune cookie.  Ha nothing crazy, just a chocolate fortune cookie.

Service was good, prices were good, and so was the food.  They have a pretty extensive menu, with many dishes you usually only see in chinatown.  I&#39;ll be back for sure, as it&#39;s now on my work lunch list."

I am a big fan of the Singapore noodles!!! The potstickers are fine, the egg rolls are egg rolls (how can one screw up an egg roll?)...

Here is what I like about this place...any time I have ever been there, the only customers eating there are of asian descent....they are usually speaking in their native tongue and using chopsticks instead of a fork. I usually see either couples, or more regularly large, multi-generational asian families eating there.

This is a GREAT sign in my opinion, because it means the food is likely more authentic. Being a gringo, I do realize that a lot of the Chinese food on the menu (and in most take aways in the states) have been dumbed down for the western palate...I doubt you&#39;ll find generals chicken or sweet and sour pork in Beijing or Canton...

Hong Kong café has those dishes of course, but they also have things like jellyfish, stuffed bean curd...not that I have ever had those (I&#39;m just not brave enough I guess), but the fact that those are offered reinforces my opinion that they do authentic cooking first, and cater to the Midwestern corn eaters second.

I have had only one bad experience there and it was my own fault. I had never had chow mein before - ever in my life, and decided I would order that. I&#39;m sure (hopefully) it was prepared well, I think it is likely just the nature of chow mein...it was a disgusting, opaque, slurry of noodles and pork. Flavoreless and tasteless and a texture that made it wholly inedible.

This one experience however, did not influence my rating for this place. I ordered gringo food, I got gringo food - my fault! Not theirs! Try the Singapore noodles and you will come to understand why, in my opinion, this is hands down the best Chinese take away place in the area (with the exception of Yu&#39;s which really isn&#39;t a takeaway joint)..."

My wife and I walked into this Giordano&#39;s restaurant on a Friday night at 7:30pm, fully expecting to wait a while to be seated.  No wait, we were seated immediately.  The place was busy, too!
We ordered bruschetta for an appetizer and a small stuffed pizza with sausage, black olives, green pepper, and tomatoes.  The bruschetta came out almost immediately and was very tasty.  The pizza took a long time, but the menu warned of a 45 minute wait for the stuffed pizzas.  It was well worth the wait as the pizza was excellent!!  A small was more than enough for the two of us and we brought half of the pizza back to our hotel.
There is another Chicago pizza joint that I believe has better deep dish pizza.  Even so, Giordano&#39;s was an excellent choice and I&#39;d recommend it to anyone!!"

Our waiter, Julio, seems nice, but very inattentive. When we placed our orders, we asked for two orders of fries to be brought out at the same time as the pizza. He said &#34;you&#39;re gonna have to remind me about that because I&#39;ll forget&#34;. What!?! The waiter is supposed to remember this. During our two hour wait, our waiter Julio only came to our table once to update us on our order status, but only because we waved him down to ask. Two hours later when the pizza came out, he forgot our fries. We had to remind him about the fries. Once they came out, we asked for drink refills and ketchup. He pointed to our cups and said &#34;but your cups are full?&#34;  Yes, our cups were full,  because all the ice melted during the two hours we waited. He didn&#39;t even bring us the refills. We had to ask another waitress for our drinks! When we waved him down again,  we asked for the ketchup again. He brought it out a little while later, but all he brought was a tiny cup with about 3oz of ketchup for TWO ORDERS OF FRIES. We had to ask the other waitresses for stuff because Julio was nowhere to be found at times. Another waitress finally brought us a full sized bottle of ketchup. 

We spoke to the manager about the wait time and he said he would take care of the cost for us. When it was time to leave Julio said, &#34;So it&#39;s gonna be free, plus whatever you want to leave for tip&#34;. I don&#39;t think waiters should be asking for tips. I understand that the wait time for the pizza was not his fault. But the service could have been so much better. 

Overall, very unsatisfactory experience. Mike the manager seems polite. But our waiter need to be more attentive to his tables."

It&#39;s cheesy and decadent, unlike anything I&#39;d ever had back home in Texas. Anytime we have plans to visit Chicago, we always know pizza will be our first meal there.

There are many pizza chains in Chicagoland, but Giordano&#39;s is my favorite simply because the more cheese to sauce ratio is what I prefer. Lou&#39;s I find to be more saucy, Gino&#39;s bland, and Pequod&#39;s better for thin crust as opposed to the traditional Chicago deep dish. You can order Giordano&#39;s pizza online too which I plan to try someday. One of our friends told us that if you use a liberal coating of olive oil on the bottom of the pan you bake it in, the flavors come out almost identical.

This location in Schaumburg is fairly new and very spacious. Plenty of comfy booths and ample free parking in their private lot. 

The pizzas take 40 minutes or so to bake, so I recommend knowing what you want ahead of time. That way you can place your order with your server at the same time you get your drinks. 

A small deep dish for two people is usually more than enough food. We always end up with leftovers because I can&#39;t eat more than two slices in a sitting. (I even remove the crusts to save my appetite for the middle since that&#39;s where all the glorious melty cheese is). 

We also like to start with their bruschetta because it&#39;s really delicious. It has mounds of seasoned tomatoes and fresh mozzarella on top of crusty bread. They then drizzle it with a balsamic vinaigrette and finish with a sprinkle of basil. 

Our favorite topping combination is pepperoni, fresh garlic, and jalapeño. It&#39;s the perfect blend of savory, spicy, and salty in each bite. 

They have decently priced lunch specials also, but I&#39;m assuming for those you can&#39;t custom pick the toppings since they are probably baked ahead of time to get people out the door and back to the office in an hour. Same thing goes with their online pies which you can only get in their top selling flavors. 

We&#39;ve never had a bad experience at Giordano&#39;s and it&#39;s always the perfect place to have great food and catch up with friends. Just make sure to pack your stretchy pants."

I think the management should be happy with the staff, because openings do not always go this well. The building looks great! It is fairly large and there is a separate area for pickups. There is a full bar and the seating area is large, with a lot of booths. 

When I arrived there was a wait for a table. They said they would text me when the table was ready. Although I thought this was a great idea, for some reason, I had a feeling that it would not work. I told the hostess I was going to be at the bar and someone came and got me. Apparently, there is an issue with my cell phone provider. Since relying on my intuition is a mixed bag, maybe they should&#39;ve mentioned that, but, it turned out fine. The bartender was very friendly and the service at the bar was good. 

The table wasn&#39;t the best, but I can talk to my friend anywhere, and it was busy. The service was very good, and the food came out on time. I noticed the time they quoted for a deep dish pizza was 45 minutes, which is 15 longer than at the BG location, but at least they were upfront about it when we ordered. 

We had the  bruschetta, which was pretty decent, and a deep dish pizza. The pizza was just what I expected and It is my favourite pizza in Chicago, so that is a good thing. The manager stopped by our table to see if everything was OK, and to thank us for coming out. 

I was very happy I tried this place and I would definitely return. The only other Giordano&#39;s building I&#39;ve been in that was as nice as this location was downtown. (They just need to get that text problem worked out.). :)"

Two staff members were quite rude to my party, the service was abysmally slow and inattentive and what was up with the deep dish pizza?! Soggy, cold in parts and far less than other what you would receive at other Giordano&#39;s, from downtown Chicago to Indiana. 

Personally, I&#39;ve never had deep dish this bad - even cheap, frozen varieties from a store. Calling it &#34;Giordanos&#34; at present is false advertising in my opinion."

I called from a second phone and got through right away (while the first phone was still on hold) but by this time they had stopped delivering. Spoke to the manager, Jim, who said I can pick up an order with no remorse for the time I waited on hold (terrible customer service). I asked for a discount. Jim said sure then placed me on hold to place the order with another worker. Why wouldn&#39;t he just take my order as a courtesy? When I placed the order the worker had no clue about the discount. She advised me to say something about it when I came in. I had to hold to speak to Jim, the manager again, to ensure the discount. They never gave me a time as to when to come pick it up (when it would be done). Their excuse was it was a crazy night. Next time I&#39;ll take my business elsewhere."

This one does not reach the standards of the other ones. I can honestly say this is the worst one I&#39;ve ever been to and the worst deep dish pizza I&#39;ve ever had. The taste was ok. I ordered half sausage and half veggie. 1/2 of the veggie side had sausage on it mixed with the veggie. The worst part was the shallow pizza that they gave us.  This $30 pizza was as thick as a a dominos pizza. It was truly sad and disappointing. They cheaped out on ALL the ingredients. I guess Lou&#39;s is my new spot.

Two sandwiches two salads and a dessert. The delivery time took about a hour like they said it would. The food arrived hot, and delicious. The salads were good. And the dessert was good. Our delivery driver was very good nice brought us everything we ordered and also brought us  the plates, napkins and plastic ware we need since we were in a hotel.

In comparison to another restaurant that serves, deep dish pizza, Giordano&#39;s was better. It just was not the best pizza as far as taste. 

Here&#39;s what I liked about Giordano&#39;s Pizza:
-Portion sizes are generous
-If you like cheese, there is plenty of cheese on this pizza
-There was use of fresh spinach
-Good atmosphere for family and friends

Additional comments:
The service was excellent during my visit, but I can not guaranteed that this is consistent across the board.  Also, it was estimated a 40 minute wait, but it ended up being around 30 minutes for the pizza to arrive."

Well considering that Giordanos has always been my favorite, I always thought I&#39;d give nothing less than 5 stars! Tonight&#39;s experience changed things drastically! We placed our delivery order at 5:05 and we ordered a stuffed pizza with EXTRA cheese, pepperoni, sausage, EASY onion, &amp; a side of giardinera. We were told the pizza would arrive no later than 6:15, so when it still had not arrived at 6:40 I called in. I was put on hold &amp; then a girl came on &amp; told me that due to a system glitch, the order was never received &amp; it was just put in the oven. I asked when it would arrive and if they were comping the meal so she then had me hold again to get a manager. After a few minutes a manager Mike got on the line and explained the system glitch once again, he apologized, &amp; offered us a $15 gift card for our troubles. I then reiterated to him that our food was going to be at least 2 hours late, no one called to explain anything or even ask if we still wanted it, but he was offering us a big whopping $15. He then finally offered to comp our meal, said the pizza just came out of oven, &amp; that it would arrive within 15 mins.   So NOT true! He also felt the need to tell me that someone had called off that night, etc, etc....As if that mattered to me. The pizza FINALLY arrived 35 mins later NOT 15 &amp; although I confirmed my order when I called it in, it did NOT have sausage, did NOT have extra cheese, did NOT have our side of giardinera, &amp; it had TONS of onions on it too! Geez this makes me wonder what else might have happened to our food that we are not even aware of! Wow this location really needs to get it together!!"

Everyone was telling me to go to Lou Malnati&#39;s instead but I decided to give Giordano&#39;s a shot. Well, the server was extremely inattentive. He noticed he didn&#39;t bring me a straw and said he would bring one. The next time he decided to show up at the table, he didn&#39;t bring the straw so I reminded him to bring it. Then the appetizer showed up and still no straw. The server was nowhere to be found and no manager in sight. After eating my appetizer I was very thirsty so when the hostess finally showed up to her post, I left my table and walked up to her asking &#34;Can you please help me find a straw?&#34; Well, she found an unwrapped straw and gave it to me. Even though it was unwrapped, beggars can&#39;t be choosers (I guess) so I went ahead and drank with it. The pizza was undercooked and the chicken cobb salad had no distinctive trace of chicken in it. I forced myself to give the server some sort of gratuity. I was so tired of waiting for my check at the end of the meal that I went to the empty hostess desk once again in hopes that someone would notice me and I can finally leave this nightmare experience. The server finally shows up to tell me that I can pay at the table. When he noticed my facial expression in response to his statement, he said &#34;Yeah, I should&#39;ve brought you the check.&#34; Finally, a manager decided to appear and ask me if I have been helped and I said &#34;barely&#34;. He offered to hear my feedback but I didn&#39;t want to make a scene in front of my family. I doubt I will ever return. Totally not worth the money!!!"

The crust was soggy. The sauce was scarce and flavorless. The cheese was barely melted and hard. So disappointing. This is our go to pizza place in the city and its always spot on. Clearly this location has a lot to learn. Customer service was awful too. We had an issue with the timing of when our pizza would be ready. One employee told us 45 minutes but in reality, that estimate should have been doubled. I think our pizza may have sat back there for a while before it got to us. Manager Mike was less than apologetic. Offered nothing to resolve the issue other the. Letting us know how busy they were.

Time of my visit: Dinner-ish

This was my first time at this place.  I wanted to know, if it was related to Poor Boy down in Maywood, but forgot to ask.

I ordered Gyro sandwich to go and nothing else.  It was made fairly quickly and I was on my way.  The service was polite and curious!

I got home and the sandwich looked beefy (no pawn intended), which was good!  It had cucumber sauce, onions and tomatoes.  The meat was juicy, tender and excellent!  The pita was soft and warm.  I would say it was one of the best Gyros I have ever had.  And it was at good price too, $5 and change.

I would give this place an A!  Definitely a return visit is in order and soon!"

Myself and two others came on a Saturday night right before closing - 8:30ish. Service was friendly and fast. The restaurant is small but offers a a few tables, counter and stool seating. The dining area is kept very clean with a steady stream of customers. We dined in and saw what appeared to be regulars getting take out orders. Everyone seemed to know each other. 
My ribeye steak dinner was delicious! Well seasoned, tender and a nice portion. The pita was hot and soft. My son&#39;s meatball sandwich was tasty but on the small side.  I think it could of stood at least two more meatballs. The bread to meatball ratio was a little off. French fries were hot and salty, just the way I like them. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the horchata was, very cinnamonany. If that&#39;s a word.

I went to Poor Boy 2 for a quick lunch a few months back and I really didn&#39;t think it was anything special. The food was below average, the service was OK, and the parking was sparse. I will say that their prices are very reasonable, I would go as far to say that they are &#34;cheap&#34;. Then again, I thought the food was meh, so I guess this makes sense. 

I came in around 1pm on a weekday, so the lunch hour was still very active. They share a parking lot with a cleaners, a pizza place, an Asian massage place (HEYO!) and I think a small lotto store, so needless to say that the tiny shared parking lot can get pretty full. It&#39;s all tightly packed, so pulling in and out can definitely be a strange challenge.

I ended up just ordering a cheeseburger with fries for carryout, since their limited seating was completely full. I ordered my burger medium-well, and it came medium-rare, which isn&#39;t a big deal to me, but it still wasn&#39;t the way I ordered it. The fries had clearly been sitting for a little while, as they weren&#39;t hot at all. The burger was only $2.59 and the fries were another $1.64, so $4.23 for lunch isn&#39;t too bad at all. However, I would much rather pay a couple bucks extra to ensure my food is hot, cooked to order, and tasty. Unfortunately, my food wasn&#39;t any of  these.

Maybe I just caught them on a bad day, since the reviews are generally positive. And, considering I live so close, there&#39;s a chance I&#39;ll give this place another shot. However, I still haven&#39;t been back, and they certainly aren&#39;t high on my list to try again. Although, if you need to wait on your cleaners, you could always pop in for a quick massage, then play a couple scratch off tickets, and grab a $5 meal, all without leaving the parking lot."

Inside there are a few tables, some stools and a counter to sit on. A large menu board to the left of the order counter showing all of their menu items, and even a few picnic tables outside the door.

First off let me go over the Hot Dog served here. The hot dog they serve is a Red Hot Chicago branded dog served on a soft non-poppy seed bun. To my delight the pickle is thinly cut, they use the right amount of onions, relish, mustard and use sport peppers that are neither too hot or too large which properly compliment the dog itself. The relish used is a little sour, and I don&#39;t detect any celery salt. But beyond those few flaws this is a good quality Chicago style hot dog.

Where Poor Boy&#39;s excels even more is at grilling things, their burgers have nice thin well grilled patties with a nice char flavor to them, their chicken sandwich is good as well. 

Overall Poor Boy 2 is a quality establishment serving traditional Chicago-Style eats. I recommend it!"

If you&#39;re ever in the mood for some excellent gyros (like we were tonight knowing January is when people go on diets) then this is THE SPOT!  

I was a little leery on making this a choice at first, but after reading other yelp reviews, we decided Poor Boy 2 was worth a trip.  Let me tell you....POOR BOY 2 WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!  Don&#39;t get skewed into thinking this little strip of stores won&#39;t offer something great.

My wife and I made it over to the supposedly &#34;BEST GYROS&#34; (according to the Daily Herald) on Wheaton&#39;s N. Main a few months ago .  I would love to know who paid DH off for those votes. (those aforementioned gyros are nasty, greeeeezy and OMG I&#39;m going to be up all night!)  In my opinion there is NO COMPARISON!  Outside of Gemato&#39;s in Naperville, Poor Boy 2 has THE BEST GYROS around.  Pita griddled to perfection, gyro meat pilled just high enough and topped with nice fresh creamy tzatziki sauce.

Lastly, instead of shouting out ready orders to everyone within the fairground area, the guy (chef) was even kind enough to bring out our order to our stools where we waited and thanked us before we left to partake in gluttony in the comfort of our own home.

One suggestion I&#39;d like to make (and earn that 5th star) would be to replace their current frozen fries with fresh cut fries. 

None-the-less, Poor Boy 2 will be seeing us making many return visits."

Although the dinning area was small, I ate outside on their patio tables and it is quite delightful.

They usually have their Biryani in containers in thrupthi foods. This is the first time i actually drove to the restaurant to try it out. 

We tried our regular chicken Biryani and they have something called &#34;Banjara Biryani&#34; which is a biryani with slight chicken curry in it. It was really awesome but  a little spicy. I would recommend to try this. 

The Biryani portions are huge and can definitely serve two people."

They certainly have good portion sizes for take out only place. Their menu is limited and they stick to the things they do the best. 

I didnt order the biriyani, which seems to be the customer favorite. If they had named their restaurant Sampurna&#39;s Biriyani, then it would be differentf! Their chef&#39;s special pakora kadhi and masala eggplant were okay. On the weekends i had to pay for rice and naan extra. Food was served in take out containers so not a real dining experience. 

I will probably have to try their biriyani before changing my review but for now if you are not going to Biriyani then you might be better off going some other place in the neighborhood."

The dosa is a good portion size for one person and the mattar paneer was full of flavor. I found it disappointing that rice is only offered with curry during the weekdays. I hope they start serving rice with curry on any day of the week. The best part was the masala chai for only 99cents and it was delicious. However, the chai is kept in a thermos and so it lacks the freshness of a recently brewed chai. Overall, it was a decent place for lunch.

Food: We got the butter chicken, chicken biriyani and garlic naan. They all had great flavor and the chicken was so tender. Surprisingly though, the garlic naan is what took it to the next level. The texture was soft and chewy, while the garlic kept my taste buds in check! It went really well with the butter chicken.

Service: Service was nice and friendly. We ordered at the front and waited to pick up our food at the table. During our meal, the host went to all the tables asking how the food tasted. For a place that has a order &amp; pick-up setting, I thought it was nice they paid attention to their service. 

Atmosphere: The reason one star was knocked off. The atmosphere was small and cramped. Not a big deal, but I&#39;d probably just order to-go next time."

Their food is delicious, And the guy at the counter is pretty friendly too. He offered us complimentary lassis a couple times. :)

We have had butter and garlic nans and onion kulcha, all tasting good, and gongura chicken, baingan bharta, andhra chicken, andhra vankaya, palak paneer, paneer tikka, tandoori chicken, chicken 65 - all of them are delicious - gongura chicken, palak paneer and Andhra vankaya, though we could actually get the latter only once out of the many times we ordered, are particularly good.

Baigan bharta that they make is not actual bharta and it is Eggplant in spicy gravy served in Andhra Pradesh with biryani... It tastes good for sure but the name is misleading??

It&#39;s cheap, it&#39;s well worth it.  I&#39;ve attached some pics.  My wife and I went a few days ago.  I had the Butter Chicken and on first bite my eyes lit up.  Amazing.

Also at first I was thinking why did they serve the food in Styrofoam even though I was eating in that day.  Then you realize oh! excellent idea, because I can just take it to go, it&#39;s already ready to take home if I can&#39;t eat it all.

Best samosa&#39;s I&#39;ve ever had.  Typically when you go to Indian restaurants, the dough is either mushy or has no taste.  Theirs is crispy as hell and tastes just awesome.  Sauce is good.

Aloo paratha was made with the alo o subzi loaded with onions and mustard seeds.
Roti sorry but not even ok and that is basic thing which any restaurant has normal taste.
Dum biryani never tasted like biryani at all we just had a spoon and thrashed it.
Egg curry was so so badly done with 3 boiled eggs placed in left over alo o subzi.Never till date we have seen egg curry with aloo subzi gravy with some hairs as complimentary.
It&#39;s just waste of time and money.Just stay away..You might be wondering why some many good reviews.We saw that this is right opp to IV apartments filled with majority of desis..It&#39;s very reasonably priced for bachelor&#39;s and families just arrived from india who want to eat there or to go orders .
Unfortunately we could not say a word as they took the payment even before we were seated"

I found this place on yelp (thanks yelpers!) And decided to give it a shot. 

The owner greeted me with a big smile and made me feel really welcome. When I told him I had no idea what to order, he helped me decide on the butter chicken and naan. I also ordered lentil soup and the veg samosas. I had the mango lassi to drink. 

The food came out really quickly, and my mouth started watering when I saw and smelled it. He was right on the money with his suggestions. Everything was delicious, and I plan to come back every time I&#39;m in town."

Yesterday, we ( party of 8 )went there for the first time and ordered different types of biryani, butter chicken, gogura shrimp, dal, tandoori chicken, seek kababs,  and different types of naan... One word... awesome! 

The staff and the owners were very friendly,  helpful and awesome.  The quality of food was great. 
The only reason I gave 4 stars, is that this place is small, and is not very sit down friendly ( they have few tables).  It is truly a carry out place. But, there are certain foods like tandoori chicken, Kababs and Naan, which need to be eaten right away, so you get the right texture and flavors. We ate there, but I would have had a different experience if we had brought it home. 

Next time, I would love to see the owners allow BYOB! The food deserves a good Indian beer ( buy it next door)!!"

So very glad for the Yelpers who reviewed it! From the outside, it doesn&#39;t look like much. Inside, the seating area is very quaint. But the food? Prepare yourself for the aroma and flavors of India, prepared with love and care. 
I chatted with the cashier and a young gentleman about what to get. They were extremely friendly, didn&#39;t make fun of my inability to pronounce the names of dishes, and made awesome recommendations. I ended up ordering the butter chicken, tandoor chicken, and the baby goat curry (which was on special).
I ordered to go, and was served a sample of another dish while waiting. They cook everything fresh, so I was more than happy to wait. The free bite was incredible- I wish I could recall what it was, spicy sausage in a green sauce that had heat and a &#39;zing&#39; too!
As I drove home, the aroma of India filled my car, and I might have been driving above the recommended speed, just so I can enjoy it sooner.
I almost ate everything. From the colors, the spices, the texture and taste, my dinner was an adventure. The meats were tender, and the naan was fluffy and fresh, and paired perfectly with the rich sauces.
I&#39;m, very much, looking forward to the next opportunity I have to feast on their decadent take out. I&#39;m planning on trying their fish dish, and chicken bryani.
Give it a try, if you enjoy incredible indian cuisine!"

I started eating Indian/Pak food a few years back and am a big fan of it. This is a great spot for freshly made to order Indian take-away...you could eat there, but it is small and not the most up-market of settings...it is a total winner though for take-away!!!
 
I have been there several times, but have only ordered a few things:
 
Biriyani - On the weekends they have goat - I have also had the lamb biriyani...this is consistently excellent and for between $8 and $12 depending on the variety, you get a TON...I am a man of some girth and generally it takes me two days to finish an order of their biriyani. It is some of the best I have had anywhere.
 
Chicken 65 - You know those popcorn buckets they have at movie theaters? Just fill one to the rim with this stuff and I would be happy for a long time...awesome!!!
 
Naan - freshly made to order in their tandoor oven - it rocks the Kasbah!
 
Tandoori Chicken - I recommend it...decent flavor. Be aware, it takes approx 30 min or so, so phone in your order.
 
Saag Paneer - Spinach with paneer...the flavor was quite nice, but I am used to a thicker consistency so on texture alone, not sure as I would order it again, but I think this is due to personal preference - it was well prepared
 
Mijji Binjji - or however you spell them...these are pretty spicy chili peppers coated in lentil flour and deep fried. The owner gave me a sample while I was standing there a few weeks back and it was awesome! I ordered them last night and - like most fried food - it doesn&#39;t travel well. While still warm, it had steamed in its Styrofoam container on the drive home and ruined the texture. If you are eating there, they are worth getting - do not advise these for carry out
 
Pakoras - deep fried lentil dough...not as exciting as the Mijji Binjji above but has the same issue when taken off-site - the deep fried dough steams on the ride home and looses texture.
 
This is a GREAT place for take-away. It is the same or cheaper than other Indian places in the area that I have seen/visited. I probably wouldn&#39;t eat on site, but I get take-away from there every other week or so and love it! They just opened a few months back and I really hope they are doing well (seem to do ok) because I want them to stay around for years to come"

We ordered the veg samosas and lassis first which I must say were great. We also got the fish fry which would have been good but was very spicy!!

I ordered the chicken biryani which was cold had little chicken and too pricy.

My parents had masala dosa and idli which were also very bad. Potatoes in the dosa were cold and dosa itself very dry. Idlis were also cold and dry. But the most disappointing was the sambar. It was sour like it had gone bad and I couldn&#39;t eat one bite. 

Sadly the only redeeming quality was the price and the lassi and samosa. However the staff were great and the owner covered us for the dosas and idli because of the quality. Hopefully they get better in the future."

Short Story:
They screwed up our order 3 times (We only ordered 2 dishes and bread). It wasn&#39;t busy. We asked for a refund for one of the dishes because the eggplant was not cooked and we couldn&#39;t eat it. They did not refund the tax. Insult on top of it all. Wish the owner would reach out to me.

Long Story:
We ordered two veggie curries and some bread. They brought out 1 veggie curry and rice. We reminded them that there is one more curry and not rice but bread. So after another 10 mins they brought bread, and we had to remind them of the 2nd curry.

Finally they brought the masala egpplant, and as an apology for the 2 screw ups they brought a small mango dal, it was at room temperature though so we didn&#39;t eat it.

The masala eggplant  consisted of 2 baby eggplants, whole and very much under cooked, not at all edible. They were in a very runny sauce that wasn&#39;t very tasty. 

We finished the 1st curry and bread, and when the employee came to ask if everything was okay we told him that the egg plant wasn&#39;t cooked. He offered to bring some tamarind rice, but we asked for a refund, he agreed and then we waited for another 5 minutes, finally I had to go to the cash register to get our money back, he told the woman behind the cash register only to refund us the price of the dish, $9, he didn&#39;t refund the tax we paid. Crazy right? I was tired of waiting so I let the 90 cents go.

Needless to say we won&#39;t go back here, which is too bad because the first veggie curry that we got was really good.

I would recommend other Yelpers stay away!"

- They forgot to put the 2 sauces in both mirchi and samosa (how do u even forget this, how could one eat without any sauce? It&#39;s common sense!)
- The mirchi was $4.99 but was the worst one I had ever tasted, so old, dry and blant.
- The Bhindi masala taste was horrible with all aged rubbery ones. Horrible one. (I liked their 
  eggplant one and thought they will make it like that). Also, there was NO salt in the curry 
  (not less salt, but NO salt at all. They just forgot).

The service was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. This is a great place for drinks or dinner after work or a low key date. 

Most of the entrees come with soup or salad and a side of cheesy garlic bread and the prices range from $10-$15. I thought the food was a good value for all you get. 

I had the chicken vodka pasta and it was tasty! I had enough for 3 meals, the portion sizes are very generous. The caesar salad I had with my meal was good. 

My only small compliant was that the cheesy bread was burnt, I probably would not have served that to someone. I&#39;m sure if I said something they would have given me a new one.

Came here with my dad &amp; younger sister before my dad leaves out of town. 

Plus we needed some bonding time together. :) 

The place is cute, I like the option of sitting outside.


Presentation of food - 9/10 

We ordered the Mergherita Pizza 18&#34; &amp; the Penne Rustica.

The pizza : 7/10 - NOT enough cheese. Seriously tasted like straight up Tomato Purée... WAAAY too much tomato, and not even cheese to even out the flavor. However, it is unique &amp; the fresh basil was nice..

Pasta : 7/10 - GREAT, new flavor. The sauce was seriously extremely watery??? If the sauce was a tad bit thicker it would be DELICIOUS. Reducing the sauce would be a great option however, it&#39;s not bad watery. Just the flavor would definitely hit home run if it was thicker. 


Anyway; the atmosphere is nice. Nice servers. Good place to try! May or may not be back for the quick pasta."

We noted on their website that one of their offerings was beef wellington which has always been one of my favorites.  After experiencing the wellington I now find myself torn as to whether to have a go at another menu item or have one of the best meals available and stick to the known beef wellington.  I strongly urge anyone who enjoys a good steak to try the wellington.  I do not believe you will be disappointed.

Wow, were we wrong. We were seated immediately and waited a long time for a waitress to come to our table. When she did she asked if anyone had helped us yet, we said no and she said ok I&#39;ll be your waitress. Weird, but ok. She took our drink orders  and those were brought out in a timely manner. Then she took our dinner order, didn&#39;t ask if we wanted an appetizer. When my daughter&#39;s (teens) ordered she asked if they wanted soup or salad. They both chose soup, they had the choice of Thai something, or potato. However, they didn&#39;t really have a choice as she said I&#39;ll get you potato the Thai is too spicy for you. Thanks, but my girls don&#39;t mind spicy. Our salads and soup were ok nothing special.  Our dinners arrived,  shrimp diavolo, zesty shrimp spaghetti, farfalle creamy garlic con pollo, and roasted vegetables aglio e olio with shrimp. The diavolo and farfalle were the two best dishes, nothing special but good. The zesty shrimp was tomato sauce with shrimp and spaghetti, we don&#39;t know what the zesty part was, it was missing. The roasted vegetables with olive oil and shrimp was a huge disappointment, the shrimp were missing and when I pointed that out she said she would get me a plate with some shrimp. I declined and asked for the extra cost to be removed from our bill. The vegetables were sparse, when roasted vegetables are listed as the main ingredient I would expect there to be a lot of veggies. There was maybe a 1/4 cup of very small pieces of broccoli and a few pepper slices. Tossed in olive oil apparently means swimming in broth. So disappointing. Our waitress didn&#39;t come back to check on us, mid meal and our drinks were empty. She finally showed up and said I&#39;ll bring you boxes. My husband said no we are not done and we would like another glass of wine and a martini. By the time those arrived we were done with our meal. Overall a very disappointing experience. We will not return and would not recommend."

Shame on me. 

The Roma is simple, unassumingly located on the bottom floor of an Elgin office building. Open for lunch on weekdays and dinner on Thursdays and Fridays, Roma&#39;s demand might outweigh the supply. What do I love about the Roma? I love taking a break to grab lunch from Roma, where I am always greeted with a smile from one of the employees, all of whom seem proud of the cuisine they serve. On a regular weekday, I try to keep it simple and order one of the daily soups. 

This is no ordinary soup. Chef Frank and his staff manage to turn ordinary soups like cream of mushroom and broccoli cheddar into masterpieces. Green and red Thai curries, Thai noodle soup, and vegetarian chili are departures from the Cafe&#39;s Italian menu but it is a welcome and delicious surprise. The soups are reasonably priced to include a piece of the Roma&#39;s dangerously addicting garlic bread and a house or Caesar salad. 

When I&#39;m looking for something a more generously sized, my go to is the Eggplant Parmesan. Unlike any other version of this traditional Italian dish, the eggplant is presented in thick cutlets, crunchy and flavorful, with a side of tasty pasta. I also have loved anything that comes with the Cafe&#39;s vodka sauce. 

The food is phenomenal- fresh ingredients, deliberate and exact flavors, and innovative renditions of world classics- and I would rank the Cafe&#39;s offerings among the best in the Chicago area. My only sincere grievance is that the Cafe isn&#39;t open everyday of the week and weekend for lunch and dinner. The food is worth the wait, if you go when it&#39;s busy, but the staff&#39;s commitment and pride in Cafe Roma makes it even more enjoyable. The ambiance is intimate and warm. Don&#39;t miss this hidden treasure!"

I ordered a side Caesar salad, one of the specials, a gnocchi in an incredible vodka cream sauce $ the tiramisu. I also sampled the home made chicken noodle soup, which was nice, but not anything to get excited about.

The biggest let down was the tiramisu. Some pieces were way too wet and then others tasted a little dry, and overall I found the coffee flavor a little overwhelming. 

On to the good parts of the meal, the gnocchi were okay; they&#39;re pretty huge and the consistency was t as pillowy and light as I would have liked but the sauce was definitely a very redeeming factor. You can also add protein for an up charge. All entrees are arced with a nice slice of cheesy garlic bread -- what could be bad about that? 

The salad was also really nice and fresh tasting. And I also ordered ice tea which was served with lemon and a sprig of mint; the garnish  made the beverage  feel surprisingly  fancy for a mid-day iced tea in the dead of winter. :) 

Recommended if you&#39;re in the area &amp; crave a good Italian meal."

Seems like a lot of Italian food in a short time-span. But when the food is this good, I could eat it every day!
Everything we had was delicious. The first day was pizza, garlic bread and a green salad with Italian dressing. The pizza was thin crusted with amazingly fresh and tasty toppings. The garlic bread was cheesy, garlic-y and crisp. Yum! The salad was fresh and yummy too.
The second day was Italian beef and some sausage concoction with rolls to make our own little delectable sandwiches. All of it was juicy and fabulous. There was also Caeser salad on the side, which was wonderful.

The casual but cozy atmosphere is comfortable, but the food is what makes this place a true charmer. Ordered the caprese salad to start. For mid-winter this was about as good as my homemade version in the peak of tomato season in the summer. The lentil soup was perfect! I am a very healthy eater so it&#39;s very seldom that I can find a restaurant where I feel I&#39;m eating healthy. This place is definitely top of my list.
The eggplant parmesan was delicious!! If I hadn&#39;t already eaten so much, I would have devoured it. The good news is that now I have a fabulous lunch tomorrow! 
The only downfall here is that they&#39;re only open 2 nights out of the week. I will have to try them for lunch, but know I can&#39;t eat all the generous portions they provide.
Definitely a new favorite on my list."

As someone else mentioned the serving staff doesn&#39;t seem friendly -- I think they&#39;re very overwhelmed when it&#39;s lunch hour and they are so busy. They could really expand to take up an entire suite on the first floor. Or...open a small 2nd location in downtown Elgin (it&#39;s neeed... EPH is getting needing a little competition!) or bring it to Randall and go where the Borders was in the Commons! Expansion is needed for the customer&#39;s sake, but maybe the owners are super-pleased with the way things are, and that is OK! 

Love the greens&#39; salad dressing. Sweet, but overpowering and light. Thanks for all you do and we&#39;re glad you&#39;re staying open!"

Soups are phenomenal (they will give you a sample to try), salads fresh and giant, pastas al dente. Handmade pizzas are totally sharable. I have yet to have a bad meal here....OHHH and you get a piece of cheesy garlic toast with entrees.

What you do is order at the front counter by the register. You get a number and poker chips depending on what you order (chips are for drinks and soup). Then you sit at a table and a server will stop by and fill drink orders. They will also bring out your entrees when they&#39;re ready. Service can be scattered. Sometimes it takes a long while to get your food. But because it&#39;s really good REAL food (ie made from real ingredients) it&#39;s worth dealing with.

The place is cute and it looks like they have a really nice outdoor patio (it was raining when we went.) Very romantic. They have a really intriguing six course price fixe dinner menu that we would like to go back for. I was very impressed! Unexpected location in the Crystal-Clean building right at 90 and Randall Road.

Now let&#39;s get this straight. I like this place. A lot. You should go here. But if you want to hear my issues with this joint read on...

I do not understand why restaurants need to find new and creative ways to make ordering food difficult. I shouldn&#39;t have to ask &#34;now how does this work? What do i do?&#34; 

When entering from outside, you have to walk through the dining area, behind the bar and wait in line in a dead-end little hallway. They have one or two specials on letter-sized easels which you can see while waiting in line. But you&#39;ll have to wait until you&#39;re at the register to see the whole menu because it&#39;s Scotch taped flat to the counter. You&#39;ll pay up front, which is fine - maybe it gives you the feeling it&#39;s going to be less expensive or faster. 

But here&#39;s where they really get creative. Order a drink and you&#39;ll get some little vague slips of paper. Once you&#39;re done paying you&#39;ll walk out back out of the dead-end hallway and find a table. Now, wait for your waitress so you can tell her again what you want because the slips of paper aren&#39;t specific. Then your waitress will tell the owner behind the bar your drink order. It was a very slow process -- but I must say -- I&#39;ve seen some goofy ordering processes but these little slips of paper top everything in terms of creativity.

I&#39;m afraid my next and final issue is really small, picky and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll think it&#39;s dumb -- my wife thinks I shouldn&#39;t even mention it but I&#39;m going to anyway. We were served a very fresh and delicious salad with homemade croutons and a tasty vinaigrette. However the silverware was the least expensive form of stainless steel available (its called 18-0) and is prone to having a chemical reaction with vinegar, causing a bad taste. It&#39;s that &#34;set your teeth on edge&#34; taste I&#39;m sure you may have experienced. This problem could easily be solved by changing the salad dressing recipe.

So there you have it. Solid four star place. Bring a casual date or a client."

If you would like to do so as well, I would strongly suggest calling your order in ahead of time. The food is definitely fresh and made to order, and that can take a while despite the fact that I was there well before the lunch rush.

As far as the quality of food, the chicken parmigiana was decent. The pasta was OK, too, if a bit under cooked for my liking. The meal included a salad and some cheese/garlic toast. The oil-based salad dressing was better than expected, but I would have preferred a choice of ranch or something else. 

For what it is, Cafe Roma is a decent place and just about the only game in the area for Italian food. I&#39;d be willing to give it another shot, but this time ordering something without pasta as a side."

Owner drops off food sometimes himself and is a very nice guy. The soups are out of this world. The Soup Nazi himself would be amazed. Red Thai Curry, Green Thai Curry, Crab Bisque, Shrimp Gumbo, Beef Barley, and Chicken Dumpling are some of the best soups I have had the pleasure to enjoy. The chicken Cesar wrap is made using a thicker dough wrap (almost like pizza dough) and is really great. Chicken pesto wrap also great but comes cold (I always ask to make mine hot). Pizza is also great. If you are in Elgin, stop by and eat at this place."

I started off with a salad which was easily devoured in seconds. I had the farfalle chicken lunch special, which was surprisingly good.

I sat at the little bar/espresso station...with a lot of potential there...they do have a liquor license...so you can have a drink or wine..

Like Marc b. states you pay ahead of time...which is fine...but I finished my meal..and I wanted to stay and have an espresso and finish my crossword...There was no staff to come out and check on me..&#34;.how are you doing can I get you anything else?&#34; and if they did..was I supposed to get back in line..lose my spot at the bar...just to get a ticket, to go back out to the dinning room so I can wait around for the waiter to make me a coffee?  is that the same for desert?  is it just a cute cafeteria?

The kids ordered a jump hot dog w/cheese.  First the cheese was barely melted slice cheese it wasn&#39;t even runny nacho cheese.

The other kid ordered chicken tenders the chicken looked a little over done..

I had a chili burger..  First off the chili was so dry, the burger was even worse.. I couldn&#39;t even eat it.

Everybody else at table had a burger as well they all looked dry..  They had to load with ketchup to eat them..

We had asked for a cup of cheese for the frys they brought us im not really sure how they did it.. Was melted cheese however was cold and hard..  Had to reask for another one..

Its pretty bad when your fries are the best part  of your meal.

And one thing I didn&#39;t expect was how good the food would be. I had a double cheese, my 5 year old had a cheeseburger and my 2 yr old had a grilled cheese. The burgers are juicy and flavorful. The fries were good too - and I know this next part might seem off putting to some, and it may not have been intentional, but my kids&#39; food seemed to be brought over at room temperature vs hot. It was perfect in a mom&#39;s world. I didn&#39;t have to try blowing on their food before every bite, nor did I have to make them wait a min before they could start chowing down.

Ambiance wise, come on its obvious- the food delivery via train is so adorable and fun! We made sure to get a scoop of ice cream for each kid as well so they could get train whistles. It was a perfect ending to the day. The fountain out front was a good place to take pictures before heading home as well."

The kids love the ever-circling electric train, Thomas the Tank engine looped in the TV, and the sights and sounds of a multitude of other families eating their meals. My wife and I actually really like the burgers here, by the way - prepared well each time in a steak burger style - yet better than Steak &amp; Shake! Their milkshakes are great too!  Service is generally pretty good. On average probably 3.5 stars.

I came here since Groupon had an offer for 15 dollars at an 8 dollar value. I guess it was a little expensive so that is the reason why I gave it 4 stars.

Servers were amazing. The train serving the food was very unique and creative. 

I love meat and I had the double stacker. It was OK. It&#39;s grass fed meat and I am assuming that is the reason why the it was not the best tasting burger in the wood, but it&#39;s suppose to be that way I guess. I read in the past reviews that the fries were greasy, but I disagree. They were not bad. Shakes were very good. 

I think I will come back here again in the future. The groupon was awesome. Great to bring your kids here.

My girlfriend had the tuna sandwich and she liked it. Not a wow factor, but it was good.

The food is way overpriced, $50 for a family of 4, two of them being kids 3 and 6.  And what am I getting for this price, not anything gourmet, that is for sure.  Open up a package of hotdogs and a Walmart style bruger, and some fries from the freezer section and you have your meal.

Like others have said, it&#39;s more like a diner, just accented with trains. It&#39;s very family friendly and the staff was just lovely to work with.

I had booked our day about 6 weeks in advance. All of their party booking and FAQ&#39;s are on their website so I all really needed to do was check the place out, check out where our party would be seated and book it.  We did bring a cake instead of getting their house cupcakes. But their cupcakes did look cute. 

Their food is quite good. The menu is family and kid-centric but I appreciate that the beef is grass fed, prairie raised beef and that there are other options like salads and chicken on the menu. I love their burgers and it&#39;s interesting to know that the beef comes from Bill Curtis (of CBS) farm. 2Toots onion rings are pretty good too.  Probably some of the best onion rings I&#39;ve had. I&#39;d definitely order them instead of fries in the future. I also tried their dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets, and they were pretty good--tasted better than some restaurant chain&#39;s nugget offerings.  Their milk shakes are just ok. But I do appreciate the unlimited refills on our soda. 

They were able to accommodate our group of 24 really well. We had 2 servers and they worked so hard checking on us often and making sure we had everything we needed. Very lovely gals!  They made the day pretty perfect, and as a parent you bet I appreciated every effort they made. 

What is also a plus is that every seat in the house is along the train tracks, even the booths.  Because of that, everyone&#39;s food gets delivered by train. 

The restaurant is located next to the Metra station so if the child in your life is super excited about trains (like my guy), if you can, take the Metra, their excitement and laughter will sustain you for days."

My kids, in particular my Son, love it because he loves trains (as does his Father).  Would be nice if the place was a little closer to the actual MD West line for better visibility of what is primarily the Metra &#34;scoots&#34; passing through Bartlett, but regardless...  Would also be nice if they varied up the Lionel trains used to deliver the food.

The food isn&#39;t spectacular, the menu isn&#39;t expansive as it&#39;s a kids place, it&#39;s not meant to be, it&#39;s your pretty basic burger, grilled cheese, chicken tenders, type thing, but it can be a little bit more than just taking them to a pancake house/family restaurant for the same.

If you don&#39;t like loud noises, meaning whistles (as they&#39;re given to the kids), or the poor young waitresses having to endure their shift there pulling the train whistle, this place is probably best avoided.

YES, there are kids here.  Last I checked, Kids have the attention spans of a puppy or kitten.  They aren&#39;t going to sit in a chair, peacefully, for a half hour to an hour during lunch.  If you don&#39;t like someone else&#39;s little young-un&#39;s running around, potentially walking up to you (I&#39;m referencing the one woman&#39;s review about this is the best place to affirm the use of birth control), then again, this place ISN&#39;T for you."

There&#39;s something about trains that all kids love---I won&#39;t try to deny it--just roll with the punches---I do think it&#39;s cute that you&#39;re food comes out on a train.

Our server Kim (I think) was great with my students.  I teach special education and she was very patient and gave my kids a lot of wait time when placing their orders and she didn&#39;t even flinch when good got spilled and ketchup squirted.

We did however, get a dirty look by a young mail server when one of my students got excited and knocked over a train car.  There wasn&#39;t even food on it!

They also sell cupcakes which are pretty good. I cashed in a coupon from the library for a free one and was thoroughly impressed. 

It can get crowded at peak hours so it&#39;s best to go when it&#39;s calm. There is also a mechanical horse in the front which helps pass the table wait for the kids.

I like the location right in the heart of Bartlett downtown by the train station and museum. There are often events that go on all summer, like festivals etc. So it&#39;s nice to be able to stop in for a bite if you get hungry after one of the events."

Kids can care about more than pizza and video games, if you give them the chance.

To be sure, this location is very kid-friendly. Each meal seems to come with plastic train whistles, and rest assured, these whistles were being deployed frequently, and to great effect. So I got take-out.

Still, I was there long enough to get a good feel for the place. Most of the seating is located along an O-guage railroad track, which is continuously running two trains (an old Pennsylvania 19th century-era steam engine, and a more modern one) with six or seven Milwaukee Road flatbed cars where the cooks place their baskets of food to go out. 

It is, I have to admit, a pretty cool setup. There&#39;s also pictures of trains all over the walls, neon lights everywhere, kid-friendly music playing over the speakers, and even that horse you ride for a quarter in the corner.

I ordered a cheese car, which is their basic cheeseburger, along with onion rings instead of fries. The portion was appropriate for the price, and service was extremely friendly. Once I got to having my burger, I was impressed. The meat was seasoned, and the patty was smashed, although the burger itself was still pretty moist. All the veggies were fresh, and they made a wise choice to use all grass-fed beef; I could definitely taste the difference.

Throw on a large slice of sharp cheddar, and by the end I was thinking this was the best burger in town.

The onion rings were very good as well. I couldn&#39;t really tell if they battered their own onion rings, but it certainly tasted homemade; the onion rings have a thin, very crispy shell, were nice and softened up on the inside. A little salt and I was set.

2 Toots has the benefit of a trackside location, so kids can check out the freight trains whenever they pass. Fortunately, you don&#39;t need to be 6 years old to fully enjoy this place."

The kids ordered the burgers, and the adults did as well.  It tasted REALLY good.  The fries were great, but the burger was definitely the star of the dish.

Our waitress was a little surly (read: sullen teenager) but you barely see her since the train delivers your food anyway ;)

An added advantage is we can see the Metra train coming and going which increased his excitement.  

The food is &#34;meh&#34; its a normal burger, BLT, and grill cheese.   Nothing more, nothing less.  I go here because it puts a simple on his face not for the burgers and that&#39;s worth a good review to me since we have very few places which can keep the little ones busy."

My complaint is the service. It. Is. AWFUL. I have made several attempts here, and it&#39;s not unique to any one server, they just all suck magnificently. Nobody smiles. One time my son and I went and the whole time he kept asking me &#34;Why is she so angry? Why is she sad? Is she mad at us?&#34; The whole time she was three feet away and no doubt could hear him. 

Last Friday, my son and I went in for the first time in almost a year. When we arrived, we became the only people in the place. My son chose a booth to sit in. The server said &#34;It will be easier for us if we sit &#34;here&#34;&#34; instead. So we did. After a few minutes I had to actually ask if we could order our drinks. WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE PLACE AND WE WERE SITTING IN A BOOTH HAND PICKED BY THE SERVER SO IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR HER TO SERVE US. And she ignored us and was noticeably irritated when I asked for drinks. &#34;Are you ready to order then too?&#34; No. Just drinks first, please. No refills offered without asking, nothing out of her way to provide &#34;service.&#34;

It&#39;s huge, the layout is fabulous. I love that they use Grass Fed beef. The burgers are like a hybrid of Steak N Shake and Culvers. Your food gets delivered by a train riding around the counter. 

Feels like a diner, accented with trains. Pretty cut and dry. A little pricey.

Here is why it&#39;s three stars instead of four for me: 

While we were sitting there, one of the managers came over to us looked at my kids&#39; shakes (they&#39;d split one so they each had a cup). He turns around and says to our server, &#34;Did you give them these shakes?&#34; she said yes. He then proceeded to berate her in front of us about the type of straws she gave us. The straws he made her give us to replace the originals actually were worse. But whatever. Later on, he berated her for seating a large party in a certain area of the restaurant when another large party walked in. Yes, because she should have looked into her crystal ball to know that another large party would be coming in.

You may ask why I think this is worth noting - or why I even care. I was a server for a good 5 years in high school and college. I&#39;ve had &#34;that manager&#34; that does that sort of thing. It&#39;s humiliating for the server, and it&#39;s uncomfortable for the customer as well.  I tipped the server 25% because despite the manager&#39;s actions - she was a great server. 

We will go back, and hopefully that manager was just having an off day. We will see."

I took my kids here on a Sunday evening around 5. The place has a few other dinner guests but was not packed. This is a bonus for me. I enjoy taking my kids out to dinner and actually being able to have a conversation with them, which can be difficult in a packed place.

Menu is simple, which is also fine by me. The waitress was less than attentive and was too busy making sure her boss was not glaring at her pay attention to her customers. We ordered and food came out. I was surprised that the grass fed burger was so greasy and really just a skinny lump of meat on a bun. The fries were also greasy. My kids had chicken nuggets and those were overcooked.

They each had a cupcake that they did not eat much of only played with the train whistle.

We took our son for his 2nd birthday. He absolutely loved it. He was so interested in all that was going on, he barely ate anything, but he entertained himself so that the adults could eat, a total plus.

The only reason for the 4 stars vs. 5 is the food. The burgers are so thin, I mean super duper thin. I felt bad for my husband and father, they should have ordered the double stack. One patty isn&#39;t enough for a grown man. My dad did get the chili, he enjoyed it...said he would get it again. I actually opted for a BLT and loved it. The bacon was thick and the whole grain bread was really good. The fries were also good and each burger comes with lettuce, tomato and pickle on the side. I do appreciate that they use the Tall Grass Beef too.

My son is part of the birthday club, his meal was free! Sign up your kids!!! His meal included a cupcake. He&#39;s not much into sweets, but took a couple bites, again, he was distracted by the whistle they put on the cupcake. He got a kick out of that, and in this place, him blowing it couldn&#39;t annoy anyone. My one complaint about the whistle is that they gave my son a pink one, I mean, come on. If there were 20 whistles and he chose the pink one, then fine, but if anyone from the restaurant is reading this, maybe you should segregate the whistles by gender. It would have been a nice touch. Good for my son though, he blew his pink whistle the entire ride home.

One last tip, the Bartlett train station is right across the street, I wish we would have taken the Metra there and had the true train day. Next time...."

Music overhead was 1950&#39;s and 1960&#39;s classics and a small flat panel TV in the corner of the restaurant was playing &#34;The Polar Express&#34; (since it was the Christmas season).

Food is okay. I had the grass-fed beef burger and onion rings. The meat on the burger was kind of amorphous (versus round) and thin, but tasted just fine. Onion rings were average with a smooth batter coating.

I also ordered a vanilla shake made with real ice cream. Though I have a sweet tooth, the shake was very sweet. Maybe more ice cream or milk and less of the shake flavoring mix would help here. Too sweet for me to order again. Maybe a root beer float will be in order next time.

When you enter the restaurant, you should wait to be seated (or ask). I walked in and seated myself, then found out that they will seat you or direct you to a table. Others that came in after me did the same. But they were nice and didn&#39;t make a big deal out of it.

Service was nice and friendly. When your food is ready, a train comes from the kitchen area, travels around the restaurant and stops at your table where a server will remove the food from the train cars. Your server will also bring your drinks directly to you. Aside from the old style milk shakes and malts, the beverages looked like typical fountain drinks including pink lemonade and orange soda.

Overall, this is a fun, novelty type restaurant experience across from the Bartlett Metra train station. Great for families. Single diner counter seats for individuals. If the front parking spaces are filled, there&#39;s additional parking at the back of the building. Again, the food is okay but nothing to write home about. You go for the novelty of the place."

I am really tired of kid restaurants having terrible food.  I mean, adults like to eat good food!  Especially if we chose to enter a restaurant!  The fries were dry and potato-y (isn&#39;t it kind of hard to screw up french fries?) and my BLT wasn&#39;t terrible but just incredibly BORING.  What a BORING menu. Onion rings were good though, as was hubby&#39;s Tallgrass beef burger according to him.  We were the only ones dining on a Tuesday evening, the ENTIRE time.  I suggest making the menu better and more exciting and it will be a regular place for my family!  Was happy my nut and peanut allergic son did not react to the fries, onion rings, or his hot dog(they told us he would be fine when we ordered)."

We were welcomed with a smile and seated right away.  The menu had lots of kids&#39; favorites like chicken nuggets, PB&amp;J, grilled cheese, hot dogs, and burgers.  For adults, they offer what you might expect at a diner: burgers, chili, salads, etc.  While we waited for our food, there were plenty of fun and interesting things to look at and talk about.  And of course, the most interesting thing to watch was the O-gauge train that delivers food to all the tables.

We were very excited when we saw our train coming towards us with our food.  The food was hot and delicious.  For dessert, both kids ordered an ice cream sundae, which comes with a train whistle.  There was enough dessert for leftovers for daddy.

My 9 year old loved this place so much she insisted that we give this place a top-notch review.  The rest of this review is from my 9 year old daughter:

&#34;I love this place! I wish I could live there. I really like all the big surprises in there. I also love the way they deliver the food; it is so fun. It has quick service. Also, I really like their theme, and that&#39;s why you should go there.&#34;"

The first thing I don&#39;t like about this location is the hours. They are only open until 7 or 8, which I was bothered by at first but since I have zero intention of going back here, oh well. Their loss I suppose. Second thing. The staff. Do any of them even want jobs? I saw more eye rolling here than at a celebrity rehab show. I&#39;m sorry that ordering is taking away from your snapchat time, but you know...you do have a job to do. Third. The menu is painfully short, painfully bland, and just painful. I understand that this place is geared towards kids and that&#39;s a wonderful concept. But at least throw the adults a bone by having a more extensive menu.  And speaking of menu.....grass Fed beef, insert obligatory cheer and ooohs and ahhhs because people seem to think this is a godly idea that only this place has. And I&#39;d love your grass Fed beef burger so much if it had even an ounce of flavor instead of just feeling like a misshapen meat ball soaked in old grease. Fries were okay I guess...But let&#39;s be honest here.  How much off of Two Toots menu seems like it came right out of the frozen section at costco? No thank you. What a craptastic experience and a shame too, since the location is great."

This is the newest location (just opened today) in the growing 2 Toot&#39;s restaurant family. It&#39;s located immediately across the street from the new Bartlett Train Station building and patrons get a great view of the passing Metra and freight trains. 

All the food is delivered to every table/bar seat via a train. My kids had an absolute blast and I think just about 90% of the people there were with kids. The menu is very limited (burgers, hotdogs, tuna salad sandwich, grilled cheese, etc.) Nothing fancy. I had the &#39;Cheese Car&#39; (cheeseburger) along with my wife and the kids had the chicken nuggets. The nuggets were typical quick fry fare, but were dino shaped, so the kids loved that. The fries were standard diner style fries, but were salted well and nicely crisp in on the outside, yet still soft/mushy on the inside. 

The beef is TallGrass beef, an organic grass-fed beef (no hormones, antibiotic) and the dogs are also the same, with no nitrites or nitrates, so people looking for a great diner with good, &#39;healthy&#39; organic beef, this is a good place to start. 

The deserts are rather limited (cupcakes, brownie or a rice crispy treat). My kids had the cupcakes and I had the brownie. The cupcakes were okay, but the brownie was good, with an amazing amount of chocolate frosting on top. All the deserts came with a toy train whistle for the kids. 

The place is nothing spectacular, typical diner, however, the train theme and location make it a treat to go to. Hopefully, it fares better than the prior two restaurants in this location that closed in a year or less."

I really like that the kids meal comes with carrots or a fruit cup instead of fries. Only negative is the service.

I understand it&#39;s mostly teenagers but they could come check on us every now and then without me having to wave them down.  The past couple times I&#39;ve gone I swear I could have just walked out without paying and they wouldn&#39;t have noticed but since we come here I can&#39;t just burn the place.

only reason i didn&#39;t give it 5 stars is because i could hear the manager in open berate the staff (all teenagers) in the eating area about what &amp; when to clean. Waitresses were very nice.

food is a lil pricy but once again it was very good

There is one waitress in particular who has waited on us multiple times and I always cringe a little when I see her approach our table. She&#39;s slow and inattentive even on her best day.
This is a fantastic place for an occasional family treat, especially if your kids love trains. But I&#39;m always surprised to see the occasional adults sans children because without a love for the atmosphere, the food is not anything spectacular. It&#39;s decent food at decent prices, but definitely not great food or great prices."

Definitely a place to take the kiddies to! My son and daughter both loved watching the train whiz by with food.

As far as food - it is pleasantly decent. It is a pretty simple menu but I didn&#39;t go in there expecting a giant steak and double baked potato to be served via train. Kids had dino nuggets and fries and enjoyed it. I had the tuna sandwich. Yum.

The cupcake - eh. Agree with the other reviewer that it was less than stellar.

All in all - so glad this place finally opened. It certainly will be a favorite of ours and our kids!"

My husband and I decided to take him on the Metra from Elgin to Bartlett and then have lunch here. The metra ride is about 10 minutes (perfect for the attention span on a 3 year old) and then the diner is right across the street from the station. Perfect location. It was easy to get in and have a seat. Staff is friendly enough. If this review was written by my three year old nephew it would be 5 stars but it is not. 
 This place is pretty stellar. Standard diner food. The shakes are very good. 
The food is brought to the table by model trains on a track. However, every 5 minutes or so the train would derail so it would cause delays sometimes. 
 Also, to tame children from wanting the food train, they would give children their own locomotive to play with. Great idea in theory but they use Lionel trains and as a granddaughter of a model train enthusiast, I know how much those trains cost. That seems like a very expensive toy to give children who may want to ram it into the wall or ride it &#34;accidentally&#34; off the table. These &#34;toy&#34; trains were also dirty so I had to provide some hand sanitizer before we ate our food. 
But honestly, theses are my only complaints. The food is good and my nephew thought this place was the best!"

Adorable ambience for kids &amp; families. My three year old loved it. She also liked seeing the Metra outside the window. Only drawbacks were bad service and limited menu. Our waitress claimed that none of the servers were assigned to tables, and that if a person took your order, another beings food, another brings your check. As a result, we were neglected for most of our time here and we had to flag down people to help us. Upon asking a different server/ manager, he confirmed that our server SHOULD have taken care of us, and that she simply failed to do so. I wish I had gotten her name. No biggie. Just annoying having to gripe to a manager when you&#39;re trying to have a fun time with your kid. We ended up sitting so long that the oldies music and cute trains lost their luster for us. 
     Also, there was some man who worked there (the manager? Owner?) who just stood around and glowered at everybody. I smiled at him and he looked away without returning or even acknowledging my polite gesture. I&#39;m thinking that if that&#39;s the manager, he&#39;s the reason why the staff was walking on eggshells and not properly trained.
Maybe we&#39;ll go again and have a better experience with a better server :) I still recommend this as a good burger joint."

The past 2 times we have gone  to 2 Toots, our experience has been less than satisfying.  Over the past year and a half, we have been to this restaurant countless times and always enjoyed it.  Recently, it seems to have changed quite a bit. I&#39;m not sure if there is new management, but things that we&#39;ve been able to do in the past are no longer allowed.  

For instance, we were there 2 weeks ago with friends, and asked to have separate checks.  It was no problem at all, and was very convenient.  We went back today with three different families, and it was no longer allowed, which made it a pain to separate. 

We were also told that it&#39;s against &#34;manager policy&#34; to tip the high chair upside down to support a baby carrier seat.  Again, we have done this countless times in the past 6 months with our infant at this very restaurant.  I have pictures of our baby in it.  

In addition, milk is no longer a free refill.  This is not a huge deal, but unfortunate for parents who prefer that their children drink milk over pop (which is a free refill).  

Our waitress was less than attentive and seemed clueless when it came to bringing out our order.  The last two times we&#39;ve been there, the order has been messed up, and it was due to the waitress putting it in wrong. This isn&#39;t rocket science.  It&#39;s a cheeseburger or grilled cheese.  

While these are not major disappointments, I would prefer to drive the 45 minutes to the Downer&#39;s Grove &#34;All Aboard Diner,&#34; if this is the service that we will continue to receive.  This is a children&#39;s restaurant and we are coming for the experience.  I hope that the staff will see these reviews and make the necessary changes."

Red ropes that make you go in a certain way and cue are weird.  I&#39;m going to a diner, I should not have to be seated. The menu was sparse. They were touting Bill Curtis grass fed beef.  I like corn fed beef. I tried a hot dog and hamburger. The burger was fresh, but it was nondescript. The tomato, lettuce and pickle were on the side. Onions were provided in a plastic solo cup. The fries were not fresh cut, but rather a Sisco product. I get a hot dog, again with Bill Curtis being the Chicago guy and all.  The hot dog is a beef frank that comes on a bun.  You get it plain. If you want mustard, onions, relish, they give the onion solo cup again and food service packages of relish. I felt I could get the same hot dog from a vending machine, or a public museum. It was not a Chicago hot dog.

Our party consisted of 3 adults and 2 kids.  4 shakes (decent) 2 kids hot dogs, 3 burgers, 1 adult hot dog, 1 kids sundae, 5 soft drinks.  Bill was $65.00. 

The kids liked the train, the place is clean, staff was pleasant. Food was not great.
Make me a diner style burger, fry it up, have a little salt and pepper on it, have it dripping with juices. Offer up some grilled onions, or a fresh onion on it.  Make my hot dog with all the fixings.  Between the price and taste of the food, doubt if I&#39;ll be back soon. Only way I&#39;ll be back is if my little 5 and 8 year old ace their S.A.T&#39;s and demand to go there."

I had the veggie burger and the rest of the family had hotdogs, burgers and a salad. With two boys under 3 the hotdogs went down no issue. The veggie burger resembled a sawdust chicken patty. I honestly didn&#39;t expect much fom a place that touts the meat products so I will give it a pass on the veggie burger so I being a recent transfer over to the no meat lifestyle decided to try a small piece of the burger( not- so- good) it was actually greasy with no real flavour aside cooked ground beef.  The place was a bit dirty under the table was not swept out nor the booth seats cleaned and the service was less than mediochre. I actually think the train was more attentive. Seemed poorly managed and the staff was kind of in disarray.

The menu is very sparse includes hotdogs, hamburger, 1 salad and a grilled chicken sandwich. The chic sandwich was good but it was tough to find healthy choices. the sandwich came with fries and there&#39;s not a side salad option. My daughter wanted a kids meal AND a bowl of soup. the soup is only sold as a full meal but the waitress gave her a 1/2 bowl free. I thought that was really generous. My sandwich came with absolutely nothing on it but they corrected it quickly. Service was ok....about what you&#39;d expect for a place like this. Food is a bit pricey. My sandwich &amp; fries was over $6. 
Kids loved having their food delivered on a chop chop train!"

I dont actually know if they&#39;re highschoolers - but their cust, svc. skills could use brushing up.  Good shakes, decent fries and burgers.  portions are just enough, but if you&#39;re a big eater might not  be enough for you - the cost, well you are paying for the kitchiness of this place and the nostalgia so keep that in mind. good place to go once in a while - more because of the cost for the food you get rather than the taste of the food, which is just fine."

First time we came here and took my neice and nephew. The place atmosphere wise was good, diner feel, very cozy however the service left something to be desired..... The waitress took are order quick and turned away quickly as if it was a bother to her we were there... She then managed to screw up just about everything we ordered then my neice knocked over a small glass of water when she stood up to see the train which got us a eyeroll from the rude waitress.... Look when you fill out a application for a water park you better be prepared to get splashed ....when you fill out a application to work in a enviornment with a lot of children you should expect to see a spill here or there and deal with it with a little grace instead of copping a big time teenage attitude that most of us older people try to escape from when we go out for a meal..... I hate to make this entire review about 1 person but she really ruined the experience for us and when we asked our neice if she wanted to go back to the train place she responded &#34;the place with the mean girl?&#34;.... Even a 2 yr old was able to notice it.  We  went back n sat in another section and it ended up being like night n day ....service was great and the experience was pleasant and we will return again.....just never in abbies section."

The place is geared towards kids, and if it&#39;s busy it will be noisy (they put train whistles for kids on their cupcakes - trust me, it will be noisy.) I&#39;ve been here quite a bit with my parents and my four year old, she can&#39;t get enough of watching the train come around and around. Though I&#39;m a vegetarian and won&#39;t eat it anyway, I am glad that they serve grass fed beef - if my daughter did on the off chance decide to get a burger I would feel better about her eating one here than from one of the many fast food chains. I&#39;ve pretty much settled into getting the egg salad sandwich every time I go, it&#39;s a good choice. My daughter gets the grilled cheese, sometimes she eats it sometimes she doesn&#39;t. The fries are crinkle cut and really good, almost always come out super hot and perfectly salted. We&#39;ve never had a problem with the service, everyone here is really nice. Even when it&#39;s busy we never wait long to be seated. I think it&#39;s a good place to go to make the kids happy and get a decent meal."

However...unfortunately it stops at the food. As much as I like their food, I just cannot get past the restaurant itself anymore.  The building is in serious, serious need of a major remodel.  The lack of updating doesn&#39;t just mean it looks dated, but rather the lobby is quite honestly dirty. 

Therefore, the slightly lower rating reflects this.  I love a local dive as much as the next person, but I draw the line at basic cleanliness of tables and chairs. I really hope that they can turn this aspect around, because they do make a great product."

My 11 year old son ate 2 hot dogs and some of his fries - they give you plenty of fries to share (in my opinion you can split a side of fries between 2 people, easily).

Then you go inside.. still..not so hot. 
It looks pretty outdated, you can tell that there used to be a buffet of some sort before it was remodeled. I know it&#39;s Jester&#39;s and they have to stick to that theme, but some of the decor choices are old and scary. Also the menu is overwhelmingly huge and has so many choices. I didn&#39;t dare go to the bathroom.

I just decided to order the cheesy Italian beef sandwich (on garlic bread) with fries. Simple enough. 
Right as I was going to get my drink an employee brought a dispenser of lemonade. Which, OF COURSE I had. The lemonade hit the spot (not sure if it was fresh squeezed though). The Italian beef was DA BOMB. I know you&#39;re thinking, &#34;Really Kara? How good can an Italian beef be?&#34;. But I&#39;m here to tell you the Italian beef here is the hidden treasure of Elgin. It&#39;s ranked up there with top Italian beefs I&#39;ve had. I didn&#39;t get it dipped or anything, but it was still juicy.
The one complaint I had is that they served it in a basket with that normal basket liner, and the beef was so juicy that the paper started to stick to the food. I was starting to wonder if the paper was edible or not. No big deal though, before it got bad I just asked for a to go container, transferred my food to that, and finished my food.

I would give this place 5 stars for a fast food restaurant because the food tasted very good, but they need to do some renovating inside."

The Gyros Meal are great and like other people say, the portion is big enough for two people and every time I get one its PERFECT, there is a consistency to this place that I love, that I know whatever I order, its going to be made fresh and its going to come out hot and good.

I recommend you and I recommend all my friends to go here as this place is simply the best. I live in West Dundee, I will always drive past Maxwells Hot Dogs(which has horrible food that comes out cold, and have horrible service) to go to Jesters, as there is no other real competition in the area~"

Friendly family, food is made to order AND you can get breakfast anytime. The chicken tenders, pizza puff and broiled fish (with American cheese) are to die for. I am absolutely addicted! I call them up and they have my order ready within 15 minutes, I slide by the pick up window, and grab my grub. They have treats for my dog even, I love this place. Keep on cookin!!"

I&#39;ve had the italian beef from Al&#39;s Beef from downtown Chicago... but comparing the two, Al&#39;s Beef had too much of a single spice that made it a little off. Jester&#39;s italian beef is heaven. If you grab the meal, you&#39;ll likely save half for later. And you&#39;ll probably eat the other half two hours later because it&#39;s going to be running in your mind that there&#39;s still some left.

You can order by phone and pick it up. They have a drive thru. Staff seemed cool when I walked in. I&#39;m trying the gyro next and seeing where that gets me."

Service is so friendly and quick, the atmosphere is exactly what you would want at a greasy spoon type joint, and the food is delicious. Best meals to get are the gyro meal and the chicken kabob plate. Their burgers and hot dogs are great, but I always order the Greek plates when I go, they pair well with the French fries. This was the favor wit place for my soccer team to go after home games and for good reason. Amazing food and great service."

I ordered the Gyros dinner which comes with a side salad, ton of gyros meat, pita triangles, cucumber sauce, tomato, and onions.  There was plenty of food and everything tasted great.

Best gyro in the NW &#39;burbs, giant too. Super friendly service, and they have a punch card too! They don&#39;t get 5 stars for 3 reasons. 1) Their burgers are not hand made, or good. They taste like they came from a costco freezer to be honest. 2) Milkshakes are meh, not bad, but not great. 3) No hand-cut fries. Just your run-of-the-mill wavy cut fries.

1. Tomatoes were the last fresh I&#39;ve ever seen.
2. Fountain drink machine is located in the worst spot in the joint, like seriously this cat&#39;s trying to get on that raspberry ice tea to wash down his chow.

Fries were on the little over par range.

Their gyros are huge!  And I would much rather get a gyro than one of their burgers.  As another reviewer stated the bun gets soggy pretty quick - and even before the soggy starts the bun is falling apart.  I would love Jester&#39;s to get some better buns!

Their chicken strips are the best I&#39;ve ever had.  Freshly battered &amp; fried &amp; served with honey mustard.  Mmmm.

The inside could use some updating but if I&#39;m going here it&#39;s usually for take-out anyway."

But I just had to drop by and see what the ruckus was about. It is close to my school too which calls for an adventure with school friends!

Service:
You order your food and you wait for your food to be ready. The staff smiles and are courteous to customers. A step above most fast food joints that don&#39;t even smile haha.

Atmosphere:
My least favorite part about this place is how much this place needs a remodeling or refurnishing. Don&#39;t take a date here, Do take some friends out here for group lunch. Even then, the seating arrangements with the tables are a tad awkward and uncomfortable. The decorations need fresh coats of paint. Having a Jester theme that looks like it is withering away makes for a kinda creepy atmosphere. I also get the quivers when seating and tables are unnaturally moist. 

Food:
I have tried a bunch of items on the menu for my tongue to reach a verdict. Considering the menu prices I feel that this place is on par with Portillo&#39;s with a much cheaper price tag. They do fast food right with their golden fries and tender meats. I haven&#39;t been disappointed by anything yet besides how flat or too strong the soda syrup is. Seriously guys, get on that! If you have never been to Portillo&#39;s, just know that the food is up there on standards. A couple of my favorites items are the Rotisserie Chicken and Hot Dogs. The Rotisserie chicken is much better than the ones you buy in Grocery Markets and come with so many side dishes. You have a variety of seasonings to choose from too! And this places Hot Dogs are up to par with Chicago&#39;s! I am not the biggest hot dog fan, but for $2 a hot dog, I&#39;ll bite. The portions are definitely filling and above and beyond most fast food places. Even the toppings for burgers and hot dogs are generous! 

Besides the less than stellar atmosphere, I would definitely come to Jester&#39;s every now and then. The food is hot and plentiful with great taste. Call me crazy, but would honestly go here over Portillo&#39;s just for how much cheaper it is with rivaling quality in food."

I have not been truly disappointed with anything I have ever eaten there. My only recommendation would be to have better buns for the Cheeseburger.

I have usually aten my food there there or I called ahead and picked it up to go, I have never used the drive-thru, the place is always packed, which is always a good sign at restaurants."

Seriously, with the amount of people walking through the door and how quickly they get orders made. There is usually always a line in the drive thru. 

This may be one of my favorite gyros places in the Elgin area. Meat straight off the spick and then put on the grill to crisp it up, yum.  Thinly sliced onions, delsih. Grilled pita, superb.  And the tatziki sauce? Heartbreakingly beautiful. The most offensive  thing you can do to a gyros is serve it with ranch (try not to cringe too hard), that is certainly not the case here. Loaded with lots of garlic and pepper to give it sort of a spicy kick, the sauce is seriously bangin&#39;. 

Jester&#39;s is also great for hot dogs and Italian beef but I can never surpass my beloved gyros to try anything else.  

Heart attack and clogged arteries are available as sides as well as French fries.

They have all the classic options- hamburgers, hot dogs, gyros, etc.- and I also saw they have burritos, and haddock fish fries on Fridays, which I plan on trying. I could tell by the friendly staff that they care about their customers and the place was very clean. I got a hot dog and fries. Both were awesome. They really hook it up with the fries and toppings. I definitely plan on going back."

They make some really good food for a decent price. They generally have fast service. If you go during lunchtime, they are always busy so it may take a little longer to get your food, but not terribly long. Typically, the dinner hours don&#39;t have much of a wait time. The staff are always very friendly and will have a conversation with you. I typically get the meatball sub sandwich or a gyro. Depends on what I have more of a taste for. They both are by far the best I have ever had. For the price, the gyros have a ton of meat on them and are perfect. I&#39;ve had gyros other places, but I always prefer the ones here most. I wish I could rate the other food that they have, but I&#39;m stuck in a rut of getting the same thing over and over since I enjoy it so much! Definitely one of the best fast food restaurants in the city. If you&#39;re looking for a good place with a variety of good qualitiy food for a low price, this is definitely worth going to!"

Like one of the best i&#39;d ever had and Jesters is extremely generous with the meat. Got full off half of my gyro with plenty for left over.

From the owner with his awesome Greek accent and genuine smile, to his kids who work there also and always ask me how Im doing, to the rest of their staff....I freakin love Jesters. Sometimes a little too much. I have been known to eat here at least twice a week. 
So the good stuff, the food-HUGE menu, and I haven&#39;t tried everything, but you will find more choices if you go inside vs. the drive thru. Yes the drive thru speaker doesn&#39;t work and yes, you may have to pull forward to wait for your order, but its defin worth the wait, and it makes for a personalized experience, not a big deal. My faves are the Chicken Ceasar Salad, which is to die for with lettuce, green peppers, hard boiled egg, bacon, homemade croutons, onion, mushrooms...its awesome and always freshly made. Although not your typical &#39;ceasar&#39; salad, its one of my fave salads anywhere. 
I also love their gyros (very authentic and they put the sauce in the gyro vs. giving it to you on the side, though i&#39;m sure you could ask for that) and they have Greek Fries (not on the menu) with fries, lemon juice and feta and oregano, freakin amazing.  My husband loves their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.Their fish sandwich is very good too. The soups are wonderful, homemade, go on a Tuesday for their lemon rice chicken soup, its just so delicious. I could go on and on about this place. My only complaint is the buns can get soggy which I hate but really, thats minor compared to the other great elements of Jesters. They always make me feel like a member of their great big Greek family and I love coming here. Its worth the extra 5 lbs, every time."

Very good catering prices.  :-) Gotta love it; Only thing I dislike is how you have to wait when you&#39;re getting your food; they need more parking.

Time of my visit: Lunch

I chose this place because they offered Gyros.  The reviews on Yelp! were about as good as I would expect from a place like this one.

I arrived and was seated almost immediately.  The waitress came by very quickly and since I knew what I wanted, I placed my order right away.  I ordered Gyro and fries.

The first nice thing, I noticed, about the place was that they brought out a carafe of f water, made the water refills easier.

I did not have to wait long for my food to arrive.  It was a nice size plate.  Gyro looked big and there was plenty of fries.  Fries tasted average, nothing special, your typical fries.  The size of the Gyro was the pretty big, however, the taste was so so.  The meat was a bit more dry than I like, the pita was harsher than I like.  The amount of meat of the sandwich was a bit less than I anticipated.  I thought the price was a bit high as well $9.99 plus tax.

Overall a C-.  But I would like to come back and try their breakfast.

Side note: They don&#39;t accept AMEX, which is again a big pet peeve of mine.  At least there is a sign notifying customers of that."

I love that they set down a thermal carafe of coffee at your table leaving me free to not worry about when or if the server will be back soon enough to refill my cup. 

Although this is an average restaurant they have the most pleasant, hardest working server/waitress (whatever the correct term may be now) that I have had the pleasure of meeting. Her name is Vicky and throughout the years of up and down food experiences here, she is the one shining constant of this establishment.  She is a big reason that my wife and I  seem to keep coming back."

The wait is never that long and the staff is always very friendly. It&#39;s clean, the service is quick and i always have leftovers to take home. 

If I had to offer one tip of advice I&#39;d recommend a menu upgrade. More variety of juices, and breakfast items. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they do offer a wide variety of items but, it&#39;s just not up to par with a place like brunch cafe. This is just my opinion. I still enjoy this restaurant very much!"

It took awhile to get a server and way too long for her to bring my coffee. She had a pretty big area that she was helping so after I figured that out, I cut her some slack.

We decided to go against the grain here and get some eggs. Hubby had an omelette with chorizo. He said it wasn&#39;t spicy enough. He likes his food very spicy, so maybe it was just medium chorizo.

I had the grecian omelette which had spinach, tomatoes and feta cheese. It was great! I had hash browns and a fruit cup. The hash browns were fresh and not overcooked and the fruit cup was a good size and all the fruit was nicely cup up. You know, some of those fruit cups just have big chunks of cantaloupe in them and not much else, but not here.

Overall it was a good experience, but there wasn&#39;t anything special to make me want to return."

We visit on the weekends and there is always a wait. We have yet to walk in and be seated, but that&#39;s a good sign. The waiting area is nice, there&#39;s most standing room between the front doors and there&#39;s always room to stand outside. Parking has never been an issue here. 

We have tried everything from biscuits and gravy to crepes to a chicken breast on a pita to the cream of chicken and rice soup to their poached eggs and their corned beef hash. Everything has been good. There is nothing fancy or overly interesting about any of their dishes, but for consistency, it&#39;s a nice choice.

For a place that calls themselves a pancake house they have the smallest list of pancake offerings I&#39;ve ever seen. There are not even any pancakes in their specialty section. Owners obviously paid a marketing firm to come up with a great name. It just doesn&#39;t really describe the business. Better name for business, would be breakfast/lunch place. Hint: create a pancake offering on the menu with maple and berries. You could even put it in your specialities section. Crazy thinking, I know. 

The big signs in the front windows stating its a non smoking business looks cheap. Hello, this went into effect 10 years ago, pretty sure no one will be surprised at this point. Believe there were a couple other signs that had nothing to do with the food posted in the windows too. My first impression was one of those furniture stores offering 70% off for their going out of business sale, but I digress.

Average pancake house. Food was ok, nothing spectacular/special about it. Service and interior was ok and average as well."

Ive always been given pretty good service (about as good as it can get when they get busy) but once the restaurant does something to give themselves 1 star I let you know about it. Now this is a place that closes at 3pm on the weekends and in order to ensure the employees are out the door they stop seating at 2:45 giving them the &#34;extra&#34; time. For a place who does their last seating early i don&#39;t feel too bad arriving around that time. So when I walk in at 2:43 (keep in mind this is 17 minutes before they actually close) dont tell me you&#39;re closed! We walked in at 2:43 and at the time the hostess said they close at 2:45, I showed her my phone that it was still 2:44. She just said sorry were closed. I HATE places who dont keep their word.

It&#39;s not particularly far from where I work, but by the time they&#39;re open in the morning I&#39;m usually hard at work and had been unable to stop in. I finally made the trip to visit after well over a year of having scoped the place out.

The first thing to note is that the building itself is actually a ways off of Army Trail. Signage is visible from this very busy street, but the restaurant itself is actually off of Kuhn road and you have to either make a left there or drive through a parking lot to reach it. Once I finally made my way there I stepped in to a fantastic smell of pancakes, from first impressions that appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. 

After thoroughly investigating the menu I settled on a Mexican skillet with pancakes. Placed my order and waited, the wait was around 20 minutes (about a time and a half what most places I order skillets at take) and there wasn&#39;t a lot of customers. This was just slow service. Now the question became was the food worth the wait?

I dug into my skillet immediately and there wasn&#39;t a lot of egg, there was a decent amount of cheese but the chorizo was a bit on the weak side in terms of spice and flavor. The potato used for hash brown at the bottom of the skillet was mostly soft potato mush, it wasn&#39;t very crisp and it wasn&#39;t very tasty. The overall taste of this skillet was bland, it was certainly decent sized but it was made up mostly of potato.

The pancakes were slightly better but not by much. The pancakes themselves were dressed with powdered sugar, and came with maple syrup. The syrup was fairly thick but had more of a bitter taste than a sweet taste. I wouldn&#39;t say the syrup was bad, just not to my general liking.

Overall I&#39;ve certainly been to worse breakfast places than Mapleberry Pancake House. My food wasn&#39;t exactly bad tasting, just bland. While service was polite and friendly it was also slow. I&#39;ll rate this place well below average and give it two stars."

Very dirty. Waited a few minutes to be seated and noticed the floors were so filthy and not just by the entrance. Food stuck to bench of booth. Water glass smudged with remnants of lipstick. Went to washroom before waitress came to take order and was disgusted with the condition of the facilities. Came back to table without using the washroom and told my boyfriend my discovery. We decided to leave before even placing an order. So gross.

It has a cute interior, nice seatings, plastic glasses, fill-your-own coffee mugs, ketchup in souffle cups and employees that really don&#39;t like to smile. During my first time here my service was terrible. So I decided to give it another try today and give them the benefit of the doubt because I didn&#39;t want to be one of those people that gives a bad review during their first visit. The girls at the front is the face of your business; the first everyone meets and the last your customers see. Being ignored, unwelcomed, and unthanked is not something we&#39;d continue give our business to. The service did however improve, but not enough to keep us. The customer service here should really step it up because the food is just not that great to keep people to come back. Unless of course you like fuzzy mold spots on your grapes and only one napkin to use (the one that your silverware is rolled in). Sorry, not sorry."

I don&#39;t eat pork products so I like that they have a turkey option. My fiancé eats plenty of pork for the both of us and loves the meat skillet. 

If you go on a weekend after 9:30, be prepared to wait because it&#39;s packed....which I think speaks volumes about the food. 

The only reason for the 4 star review is I think the portions are too large for 1 person and I hate wasting food."

The food is decent, but not as good as Brunch Cafe or Red Apple.  Their coffee is fairly weak, but this seems typical of places around here.  Portions are average.  Odd thing?  The tables are really cramped.

My biggest complaint is the service.  Wait staff is ok, but definitely stretched too thin.  Worse is the hostess - they routinely give us wait times 50% below actuals.  If you call ahead - they seem to be trained to say no wait.  Get there 10 minutes later?  30 minute wait.  It&#39;s annoyed me enough that I won&#39;t be coming back."

I almost always get a Skillet (it gives you the largest volume of hashbrowns) The only complaint and its a common one is I wish they would cook the veggies longer, I dislike crunchy peppers and onions in my skillet.

It certainly wasn&#39;t the dirty coffee cups or silverware (gross, but I was able to overlook them).  The waitress eventually found some clean ones, so it wasn&#39;t that bad.  

I&#39;m not a big coffee drinker, but I really enjoyed the coffee here.  I think the flavored creamers were a contributing factor.  My eggs were done just right and I thought everything was reasonably priced.  

$6.99 for 3 eggs, 2 bacon, a sausage and 2 heavenly apple Cinnamon pancakes = one satisfied customer!"

The restaurant itself is nice and open and bright.  It&#39;s a pretty big place, which is nice at those busy times.  Although it can be fairly loud, it&#39;s a not tooooo loud to have a conversation with my family.

The food is pretty good.  The first thing I tried, the golden french toast, was strange albeit edible.  It was an odd choice of ingredients to throw together on a plate, I didn&#39;t see it on the menu last time we were in, so maybe they realized it&#39;s not a great choice.  With that said, they still were able to pull it off and it was tasty.  My brother really likes their tamale and chili omelet.  

The service is always good.  No complaints there.  They never bug us but don&#39;t leave us waiting for them either. 

They have a huge sign in the window stating that their last tables are seated 15 minutes before closing time.  I don&#39;t really understand this theory, but, at least there is a sign letting you know.  So, while they close at 2:30, you need to be seated by 2:15 if you want to be served any food.  Which, to me, means you close at 2:15, but I&#39;m not a restaurant professional, I don&#39;t even play one on tv, so what do I know."

This was decent, but totally average.  We arrived to what appeared to be an extremely long wait.  Come to find out it was a large table waiting ot be sat together.  We were sat within 5 minutes.  Bonus...

The server was nice and brought out our own insulated pot of coffee for our table.  I have mixed feelings about this.  One... I&#39;m happy I have unlimited coffee but two, it is in a thermos and I&#39;m not really being waited on.  What the heck do you do with my coffee when I&#39;m done with it?  Serve the luke warm remnants to the next unsuspecting guest?

I ordered a denver skillet with a side order of buscuits and gravy.  The skillet was quite good.  The buscuits and gravy were marginal and had little to no sausage in the gravy.  It suspiciously tasted as if it were made from a packet despite the guarantee from the waitress that it was homemade.  Don&#39;t waste your side on this.. Get the pancakes.  

My husband ordered scrambled eggs, bacon hashbrowns and chocolate chip pancakes. A-OK in his book with the exception of his feeling the coffee tasted like water.  Perhaps he got someone else&#39;s left overs?

Last, I have to note the obnoxious sign as you enter the restaurant that they take their last walk in 15 minutes prior to closing?  Hey- here&#39;s a thought... Don&#39;t be ghetto and turn away business.  If someone wants to walk in 2 minutes to your 3:00PM closing time... SERVE THEM with a smile on your face or close earlier.  I dealt with this a server and you are not that awesome that ou can beat customers away wiht a stick.   Can&#39;t say I won&#39;t return but can&#39;t say that I will rush back."

This place is close by and we would always pass by.  It was almost so close we&#39;d forget about it.  But then one day we went in.  There always seems to be pretty quick service even if it looks busy.
My one gripe is they don&#39;t really have a good place for a baby carseat.  Ok, I suppose they dont&#39; need to, but it&#39;s either bring the stroller and block the aisle or squeeze into a couple of the booths that will fit the carseat.  The area up top works, but sometimes it&#39;s closed when they are ramping down.
I like the healthy pancake combo, I forget what it is called.  But it&#39;s like some egg whites, multigrain pancakes and some splenda syrup.  Oh and turkey sausage.  I&#39;m happy they have turkey sausages.  Too many places only have pork.  That&#39;s fine, but I prefer turkey.
Overall it&#39;s a good place, and we&#39;ve even done takeout (when our kid was first born and wifey had a hankerin for some hash browns.)

One thing to point out: if you get your hash browns well done, it seems to take a while."

Dining service is friendly. I like how they leave a carafe of ice water and a carafe of coffee at the table for you. There are the international delight mini creamers on the table if so need a little flava with your java. The menu has a lot of basic breakfast items on the menu with daily specials. It&#39;s also not hard to miss all the ads they place in their menu from the local businesses that want to advertise--I felt like I was reading one of those magazine flyers we get in the mail with all the coupons.

Not the case here. The Mapleberry Pancake House in Carol Stream was bustling with activity when I arrived on a late Sunday morning to satisfy my pancake craving. Families, cyclists, couples and singles all filled the airy restaurant.

The restaurant was fairly modern with light yellow ochre walls, tiled floor, and dark trim accents. The servers, primarily women, were all dressed in sleek black outfits with the word &#39;Mapleberry&#39; spelled out across the front of their shirts in eye catching bling (the fake rhinestone type). The bus staff, primarily men, wore black pants and yellow ochre shirts with &#39;Mapleberry&#39; embroidered in the pocket area.

I definitely wanted to try their pancakes, but I also wanted something more. It looked like their pancake orders didn&#39;t come with any sides. So I ordered one of the other specials on the menu which included eggs, two slices of bacon, one sausage link, pancakes, and juice. I asked if I could have blueberry pancakes instead of plain, to which my server said yes. The pancakes came with blueberry compote on top, but I was pleased to find that they also had fresh blueberries in the batter too.

Overall, the food was decent, prices were fair, service was okay, and bathroom was relatively clean. Definitely a family friendly place and worth a revisit to try other items on the menu."

I got an omelet with pancakes and fruit. Pretty cheap. I went with my mom and our total was 19.07.

Times have changed now, and if we&#39;re going to go out for a meal that costs a good amount, I expect the service to be - at a minimum - consistent.

We now rarely go to the Mapleberry for a couple of reasons. The first is, that their service is not consistent. They have one consistent server there, Sarah - and she&#39;s so popular that if you don&#39;t get there super early, well, you can&#39;t request her as your server. One time she had an extra table open, and they would not seat us in her section. I don&#39;t know if it was because so many people requested her, or what. 

Every other server that we&#39;ve had there has forgotten things, ordered things incorrectly, or even just trying to get them over to your table to refill a soda is a challenge in itself. They also do not check back often to see if you are doing ok.

The food and the cost. When we started going there I loved that they had an option for Whole Grain pancakes and turkey sausage. That was, until they raised the price of it by a couple of bucks. I know the economy is part of the drive with this...but there&#39;s no rhyme or reason to their price hikes at all, and they offer coupons in a couple of sources, but they aren&#39;t worth much -- and are only good during the week. 

We haven&#39;t been there in months, so in regard to the sizes of the servings shrinking, I can&#39;t really comment.

All in all, if you feel like splurging for a breakfast, and willing to take a chance on the service - go to the Mapleberry. Otherwise, you&#39;ll save about $30 alone just making it at your own house."

Problem is that the front area is small and congested where the hostess was taking people&#39;s payments and names down for tables.  Not a good idea if you are trying to keep the line moving.  

The service was definitely slower than normal and I have been to this pancake house a few other times.  The waitress was slow with bringing our food out.  Other tables received their food before I did and I placed my order way before they even got there.  Then the food was cold.  It seemed that the food sat out under a warmer b/c my omlette was slightly cold and the hash browns were cold.  

I&#39;ve eaten here before and was happier than this visit.  My friend and I asked for a take home box and separate checks.  Our waitress comes back to our table 5 minutes later with the checks separated but no boxes.  This woman needs to work on effiiency. The food was enjoyable, but I wish it was warmer.  I would try this place out one more time."

Good service, coffee pot on the table is always nice.  Everything tasted ok, but nothing stood out.  I&#39;ll go here again, no problem, it&#39;s just that I won&#39;t drive past another pancake house to get here.

The wait on Sunday at 12:20 was only ten minutes.  For a pancake house in a busy area, I would say that is NOT an endorsement."

Skip the french toast, it&#39;s boring and plain. For some reason, I like the hash browns more when I&#39;m dining in, rather when I&#39;m taking out because it doesn&#39;t seem so burnt when I&#39;m dining in.

I&#39;ve had the omelettes, they&#39;re pretty good but they&#39;re shaped like footballs for some reason? The large sausage links are pretty big, 3 is enough for a meal. The benedicts are really good, I like the hollandaise sauce they use, and i think they sprinkle some paprika on top. 

They always have a breakfast special menu, and the portions are pretty big for the price, so I always go for that! Environment is very home-y and waitresses are basically all skinny and brunette--just saying. haha, you&#39;ll notice. I have yet to try a skillet, but it&#39;s on my list of things-to-do for sure."

I don&#39;t like to be negative after only one visit and that is why I&#39;ve given Mappleberry multiple chances - everyone can have a bad day.

I ordered a simple two egg breakfast, it came out cold- cold scrambled eggs- really? and runny, the bacon was undercooked, the hash browns were brown on the outside and raw beyond that. GROSS! The waitress never came back by even though I pushed the plate away. Finally she comes by to drop the bill and asks how the meal was,&#34; terrible, worse meal I have had&#34;. So she says really? I&#39;m sorry can we fix it? Um, no. I am not about to try round two.
At this point we ask for a bill for the drinks only since we didn&#39;t eat (my wife had an omelet that was runny also). So she gives us the bill,and goes over to a lady who is obviously the owner/manager and explains the situation, does the manager come by? NO, do they comp everything? NO. TERRIBLE. Absolutely the worst breakfast experience I have ever had. Kudos to the reviewer that was smart enough to just walk out before even ordering, wish I had had that foresight!"

A lot of the complaints I&#39;m reading about is the service... I understand it&#39;s frustrating to have to wait for food when you&#39;re hungry, but you have to expect this anywhere you go on the weekend. On Sundays, especially, when everyone is out of church. I think it&#39;s a GOOD sign when a breakfast restaurant is packed. And, they keep a large coffee carafe out on a table with cream and sugar for patrons waiting- so they DO realize it isn&#39;t fun to wait.

And, if you don&#39;t feel like waiting on a weekend, then go ahead and place an order to go. 

I have gone to Mapleberry for years and will continue to do so. The servers and hostesses are always very kind. The food is always delicious. The coffee is always hot."

Mapleberry&#39;s atmosphere is nice and open on the west side with big windows, but the east side feels crowded and not nearly as nice. So we always hope to be seated in the nice open area. Our food has usually been very good, and service decent.
One major complaint I have personally is as follows: Once, my wife and I went in for breakfast, but we weren&#39;t exremely hungry so we decided to split a breakfast between us. When we ordered the meal and told the waitress we wanted to split it, she told us there was an additional $1 charge for that!!! What?! We should have gotten up and left, but it didn&#39;t settle on us what had just happened until we had already agreed. And then... when the food came out it was not even split up onto two plates! What did we pay the extra $1 for?? A penalty for not ordering two separate breakfasts? So what if some couple with just enough money for a breakfast for 1 came in to enjoy a morning out together by splitting a meal, and they encountered that attitude? I think of my wife&#39;s immigrant parents whey they were young and new in this country and didn&#39;t have much money.  Not sure if it was the restaurant&#39;s policy or just the whim of the waitress (tall, older, slim lady with straight black hair who has always had a less congenial disposition than the others anyway). At any rate it really turned me off Mapleberry for a while. I even thought of writing the local newspaper about it, but did not. We&#39;ve been back a couple times since then but not as frequently.
Also, my wife feels like even though we&#39;ve been going there for years the staff has never acted like they know us in any way, or welcomed us back as people whom they recognize at all. Not a big deal to me, but it is to my wife."

I&#39;ve eaten here 20-30 times, and overall I&#39;d say it&#39;s OK, but I&#39;ve decided to stop going and find another place. The food is decent and usually very well cooked.  The eggs they use are probably the smallest commercially available. The bacon is thin cut, not thick.(Strike One) The point here is that they still give you two eggs and three pieces of bacon, but they make more profit.   The service is pretty good and can depend on the server. A few of the servers are very nice, but most are not very friendly, but more business like. During the week there&#39;s no wait, but on the weekends, after 9:00 AM there can be  a 15-30 minute wait. They don&#39;t give customers access to their wifi there.... They have it but wont provide the password.(Strike Two). The room is very plain and uninviting. They don&#39;t have many booths and they have a lot of two tops. The two tops are narrow and they only have a foot or so between them....tough to get out and it&#39;s hard not to put a butt in the person sitting next to you&#39;s face when getting in and out...very cramped...again trying to fit more in to make a profit and less about giving the customer a good experience. 

The last straw and third strike came when after having patronized them for a few months and many visits, I made a simple request to the blonde woman who runs the place. It was actually a request for a 4 top booth by the window at a very uncrowded time. It was the type of thing that I never had to ask for at Nest Cafe or many other customer friendly places. She got this pissed off look and really tried to force me to sit where they normally put me. So that was it for me...for her, it&#39;s clearly about her, her profit and how she wants to run the place.... And it&#39;s not about the customer.  So today, I&#39;ve found a new place in Bartlett...The Savory Restaurant on West Bartlett Road.... Where I&#39;m currently typing this review after eating a great breakfast, with much larger eggs, thick cut bacon, wireless service (where the hostess eagerly gave me the password), a very nice room, a server who was very interested in how I was doing...several times during my meal in fact she came back to see how I was doing and they don&#39;t have any two tops, where they gladly sat me in a four top on a crowded Sunday and I had plenty of room to stretch out and didn&#39;t have stick my butt in someone&#39;s face getting in and out and where the person next to me didn&#39;t have to return the favor.

In a heads up comparison it&#39;s a no brainer. If you like Mappleberry, you&#39;ll probably love Savory, as it&#39;s my new breakfast place in town."

The gyros skillet was really good - lots of meat, lots of feta, lots of everything. Also came with a side of tzatziki, yum. Tim tested, cardiologist approved.

I also had some pancakes, since I had a choice of pancakes, english muffin, or biscuits and gravy as a side. They were mediocre; not as good as I&#39;ve had elsewhere because they seemed as though they&#39;d been sitting in a warming tray for a while, but still better than Bisquick. Same goes goes for the syrup - it had that awesome film on the top that says &#34;put me away or heat me up, but don&#39;t let me sit here any longer&#34;

Would I go back? Sure. It&#39;s close to home and relatively good food. It&#39;s not the cheapest place in town, but it&#39;s also not a crappy IHOP."

The place is pretty packed on a Sunday but the wait isn&#39;t long. There are a few tables that I was prepared to say &#34;No, we&#39;ll wait&#34; unless you want all those folks waiting for a table to be walking by every minute but we didn&#39;t get one of those.

To cut to the chase: only one of us got breakfast and even that wasn&#39;t great. I ordered the multi-grain pancakes with pecans. Out came a wheat waffle with pecans, which are sprinkled on top rather than cooked in as I would expect. No, wanted pancakes. Partner kept his skillet even though he was very specific that the eggs should have stopped running by the time they got to him. And they were decidedly still runny. Finally, my pancakes arrived. Three bites - flavorless and raw. Partner showed me his pancakes - not quite raw but not quite done either. The server was apologetic but if I were the manager there, this customer would have a coupon for free pancakes. But judging by the other comments, they would be giving away a lot of coupons if they adopted that policy. So I had coffee and we left.  How DO these kinds of places stay in business?"

She got a better job. We still went there as it is close but it just went downhill. The nail in the coffin for them, from us, was over the biscuits and gravy. The gravy, particularly. It tasted as if the milk had gone bad. This was our son&#39;s meal. We of course told our server who sent the owner over. (Plastic looking woman.) Simple problem, really. This woman however, took it so personally that he did not &#34;like&#34; the biscuits and gravy. ITS HER OWN PERSONAL RECIPE, HOW COULD WE NOT LIKE IT?! ~ which was not the issue. The issue was that the ingredients were bad. Rotten milk is rotten milk, if someone tells you this to your face rather than the health department, listen. She argued with us about this issue pretty intensely and the conversation ended when realized that we were going to pay for the 2 bites taken because she simply was not taking it off the bill, period. Yes, she made us pay the percentage of what we ate. And we shared our small portions with our son because he refused to order anything else. This calculating woman. Wow.

I have to say the food is good with unique choices for breakfast, not found elsewhere.  Also great kona coffee.   We got there just before 2pm with last seating at 230, close at 3.  I thought we had plenty of time, but they started vacuuming at 215, stocking/refilling tables, staff scurring about as if they were closing at 2:30, they even took the drawer out of the register.  When we got there, right away we could tell the waitress had an attitude, seems like she had already checked out.  We were seated with no silverware and ended up getting our own off another table.  We waited a long time for coffee refills and then she sat at the table next to us, that she made as her refill station, with all her sugar packs/condiments ect..  How uncomfortable trying to eat with our waitress right there so close, working on something else.  As were eating she dropped a salt shaker and it hit me in the foot.  She did say sorry, but with such a tone like she didn&#39;t care.  To top it off when we went to pay, the manager at the counter already left and it was our waitress at the register.   I couldn&#39;t wait to leave, and neither could they.   Even though they are technically open till 3pm, DO NOT GO THERE IN THE LAST HOUR.  I don&#39;t need them, they need me.  I&#39;ll find somewhere else to eat."

I went there today and had an ok meal but the service was poor. I have to say that I have waited tables on and off for 25 years and know the difference between what the server has control of and what is beyond the servers control. I had two problems with the meal and the server didn&#39;t even try to make it  right. I have never written a bad review like this but if your food is just ok , you need to have better servers."

I just wish they could get my hash browns crispy, the top layer is good and then the rest is all that white potato.  Their potato pancakes are awesome!  Very good Eggs Benedict too. Excellent coffee.  Try the soups - very good!  Prices are comparable to other quality breakfast places, a little more that some but worth it."

Not much changed, but it did seem the servers were a bit more on the ball.  They were a completely different group than before and they seemed to want to do a good job. However, the kitchen was slow, our orders were cold when they arrived and the food was off just a little bit (American cheese is rarely shredded, but the waitress insisted that the cheese inside the omelet was that and not cheddar).   I think I could have gotten a better value going to the IHOP."

They rolled their van up, with the grill on the back, and the dude (Kuko) got right to work. He was an expert in grilling, and how to set up. Since we were on a public street he said it&#39;s better that he grills and puts everything in trays on the table for food, and will refill that way. He was friendly, introduced himself to the party planners, etc. 

Food was  decent -- beans, salads, etc. I *cannot* believe the amazing price ($22.35 ppsk). Especially since plates, napkins, silverware, tablecloths (those plastic ones, but with the cute red and white checker), sterno, tables, set up and clean up, was included.

We added vege burgers @ $4 each, and also got polish dogs in addition to hot dogs.

They showed up on time. We had Pulled Pork, Chicken Breast, and Beef Brisket as our main dishes. 

As we were taking reception pictures (outdoor wedding) we smelled the deliciousness of the master chefs cooking  the food....absolutely incredible. 

Not only did they serve the food on time but they also refill the buffet for almost 2 hours. I was honestly blown away. 

Food was incredible. Price was extremely reasonable. And they even packed up our leftovers for us.

This was quite possibly one of the best customer service experiences I have ever come by.

The broasted chicken is crispy, not greasy, flavorful and juicy. The coleslaw is really tasty as it&#39;s not
Mayonnaise based, it&#39;s crisp and slightly sweet and tangy. 
This trip I had a deluxe hotdog combo which comes with small fries and coleslaw. I asked for the dog to be dragged through everything and add tomato. It was delicious. The fries were hot and tasty, but don&#39;t come salted which is fine by me as I use ketchup, but they do give you a salt packet if you feel you need it. 
I&#39;ve never had a bad meal at the dip, and don&#39;t get me started on the ice cream treats, all are so yummy and reasonably priced.

It&#39;s got a quaint environment and the old timey &#39;drive-in&#39; stuff outside is cool. They boast the Cole slaw as being famous, and it is pretty good. I believe it&#39;s made with vinegar as opposed to mayonnaise and it&#39;s finely cut. Remember to bring cash because they don&#39;t accept credit or debit. With most currency being digital these days, it puts it&#39;s customers at a huge disadvantage; especially non locals who are just passing by. Because of the below average service and not accepting cards, I would leave 3 stars, but they compensate with their food so I think a 4 is fair."

It&#39;s cash only and seating inside is limited so sit outside when you can.  Grab a spot at one of the red wooden picnic tables under the awning.  Why they even matched the top of the garbage cans to the same red color of the tables.  How feng shui of them!

Their chicken is great and cheap.  It&#39;s broasted, not fried.  Their coleslaw is made in house as are the rolls that come with the chicken.  This place is carb heaven and I&#39;m quite OK with that.

My hubs went here with his Mom back in the early 70&#39;s and says the place hasn&#39;t changed much if at all.  I love the vintage sign, the vintage prices and the fact I can get a chicken wing dinner with a fountain soda and a milkshake for less than 10 bucks.

The fries were what you&#39;d expect for fries (just make sure you ask for salt). In addition to the good food, the prices are great for what you get, very affordable (just make sure you bring cash).

I considered this to be not a good sign. Nobody in the inside eating area. But I ordered the four wing meal to eat there. Counter guy was friendly. $6.50 for four wings, coleslaw, fries and roll. Great price !! By the way these are whole wings. Waited inside looking at the different stuff on the wall. They even had &#34;The Kramer &#34;.
 Food came and it was definitely fresh made. Too hot to eat right away. Chicken was pretty good. 8.5 on my ten scale. Fries were like most fries, dry and no salt. They did have some flavor to them.  They did however included a salt packet. If you like McDonald&#39;s fries you&#39;ll like these, I don&#39;t.  Coleslaw is a vinegar based recipe. Nice change of pace. The roll could have stood about fifteen seconds in a microwave and a  half stick of butter to help it out. 
When I left I got a large root beer to go. To this minute I still don&#39;t know what flavor this drink actually is. Seriously. 
Well I went for the chicken and like I said it was pretty good. Overall I&#39;d give the meal a 6.5. Would I go again? Only if I was in the area."

Tender, moist, hot broasted chicken comes with a soft roll and super skinny fries (fries may or may not be the same vintage as the bird. am sure there&#39;s a reason for this, not so certain it&#39;s a good one.) hot sauce is available on request.
Slaw should be creamy &amp; shredded but this stuff is chopped &amp; vinegar-based and delicious, I hate when that happens...
Dip is what they do with soft serve: white on the inside, brown on the outside.

We just so happened to come on the first day that they reopened.  The food took forever to get, even know there was virtually no line.  Overall the broasted chicken was very good.  It could use hot sauce to give it some extra kick, but I would come back without blinking an eye.  The sides were forgettable, but you&#39;re not coming there for the sides.

The broasted chicken can only be called great, among the best broasted chicken I&#39;ve tried. The accompanying fries are average at best, but the coleslaw was a very good vinegar based slaw.

The first time I ate here was during the fall so I sat in the addition (dinning room) but during the summer you can sit on the picnic benches under the awning. 

They also have ice cream, burgers, hot dogs and BBQ but the fried chicken was the best by far. Just note that they only take cash and the line can get a bit crazy especially during the summer time. 

I had to take a star away because of the funky smell of the garbage cans near the eating area but that&#39;s to be expected due to the weather and amount of people who dine here.  I only wish they would take the time to scrub them down especially when the stench is really bad."

August 27 two of us chose Aliano&#39;s.  We knew this was a new restaurant in a location off of the beaten path in East Dundee.

I was coaxed into going after putting this off for a least two months.

Jimmy was the server.  He is so perfect for working with us...actually..me.
My wife was the promoter of the visit.  I had just return to the city after 7 hours of travel.  Really not excited about going out, but I live In Sleepy Hollow and East Dundee is a quick trip.

Walking in about 4pm, there was a table of 6 seated and enjoying the appetizers and drinks.  Looking over the tables, Jimmy said seat yourself, except at the Reserved tables.  There were many reserved....I was impressed.

I noticed in one Yelp review that a person said &#34;it is a bit pricey&#34;.  I first looked through the menu and told my wife it is on the high side for dollars.  After about 5 minutes reviewing the menu and each item, I told her that this is normal for  mid priced restaurant. The choices are extensive and the prices are on target with any other great restaurant. 

We go to dinner in restaurants at least 3 nights each week.  This one really hits the price points, because the serving are more than generous and absolutely delicious.  We each ate half of our servings...and of course the remaining went home for the next day.  Additionally, we took home two chocolate deserts which absolutely hit the moon for chocolate and taste.

The menu offering is extensive.  We had tortellini with prosciutto and peas,

To die for meat lasagna.  Oh, that was after an appetizer of Aliano&#39;s calamari.

They offer three different calamari choices..  

You really need to do yourself a favor............go and love the flavors."

I had been looking forward to eating here, and was very disappointed. First of all, I called to request a table and told them we were 2. They reserved a huge front table for 5 for me. And left people at the bar who had been waiting. No one sat us, and no one came with menus or anything for a long time. Drink orders placed and still no menus. Told us he was bringing bread, never did. Toasted ravioli was thick and dry and tasteless. Salad was good, soup ok. Tomato sauce on chicken parmigiana was awful - sweet and pasty way too thick. Like Prego. Chicken Piccata was not floured, and was in a greasy sauce. Also, the chicken breasts tasted like they were those frozen kind full of a solution. Almost rubbery but more mushy. 
Prices are crazy high. Bench seating is the most uncomfortable place in the world. Our server was confused and unprofessional and slow and disconnected. 
I&#39;m sad because I wanted this to be the gem I was waiting for. Sadly it is not."

I&#39;m not an Italian food fan but this place is pretty darn good.  Only reason I didn&#39;t give it a 5-Star rating was the lack of communication with the person in charge.

Husband had the Queen of West Dundee - a 14 oz steak in Cognac sauce. The steak was a good size, and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. The fat had a nice crispy edge, but it wasn&#39;t dry. Little fattier cut than he normally would have liked, but he didn&#39;t even mind. The sauce is amazing. The asparagus was crisp and delicious. The potatoes were great. 

The manicotti was al dente, which is something of a miracle in &#34;Italian&#34; restaurants around here. The sauce was perfect. All the comforts of home. 

The pizza is a proper thin crust. Beautiful red sauce. 

And the tiramisu is huge, consider yourself warned. But it&#39;s flavor matches it&#39;s girth. Husband usually doesn&#39;t like tiramisu, but he ate half of this one, easy. 

We sat outside, but the interior looked cozy when I stuck my head outside. 

It&#39;s not a cheap meal, but it&#39;s deserving of the price tag."

Instead, I, for medical reasons crucial to my health and well being, need to avoid all foods with gluten, which makes going out to eat not always fun. It is especially hard to find a variety of menu items, much less excellent ones.  

  I went to Aliano&#39;s the other night as a friend recommended it and I noticed they had a really large selection of menu items I could order gluten free.  Decided this would be a nice place to try to celebrate my hubby and I&#39;s anniversary and to bring my parents along to thank them for their help watching our stuff while we were out of town.

What a great decision coming here proved to be!  While somewhat small, with smaller tables and quite the crowd, I had no problems getting a reservation and we were comfortable all evening.  I  had a multitude of items I could order that could be prepared without any gluten, and the wine list was extensive.

I ended up getting the Veal Saltimbocca, which was to die for. It featured tender thinly sliced veal sauteed in a lemon butter sauce with spinach, prosciutto, and mozz cheese, accompanied by gluten free rigatoni.  The rest of my party had no special dietary needs and were in heaven with so many choices. My husband enjoyed the baked Manicotti, and my parents had the pork chop with mushroom risotto, and the lasagna.  The portions were generous ( I took home a nice doggy bag)  and we all had a very great meal. We topped of the evening with gelato and sorbet as we savored our last moments.  It is a bit pricey here, but well worth it.

 As someone with a special diet, I don&#39;t want a lot of attention or special treatment, I just want to have some of the same great choices others have without a big fuss being made.  I cannot begin to tell you how much I enjoyed my food and evening here, and definitely will be returning."

Ordered one of the pizzas and was not disappointed, it was very good and I would consider myself a pizza snob. My only complaint is that the kitchen seemed slow the Sunday evening we were there...there were only a few couples dining inside and out, yet there were long pauses between our courses and sadly our attentive waitress disappeared when we needed our check.

I ordered the baked mostacholli (not sure on spelling) and I wasn&#39;t disappointed! It had chunks of meat in a very flavorful marinara sauce and a gigantic meatball to top it all off. It also had what I believe to be ricotta cheese in the sauce which really gave the sauce a distinct flavor.

Some people have complained that the food is expensive and the portions are small... but if you want cheap Italian then go somewhere that won&#39;t have near the flavor or wine choice that Aliano&#39;s has to offer... this is fine Italian dining at its best."

I had brought in 17 people to the restaurant with in 2 weeks. A reservation for 8, then a reservation for 9. I left a email with the restaurant the morning after the dinner for 9, and never heard back from the restaurant about our bad service. Drinks not refilled, including wine by the bottle. We sat with empty glasses and had to ask for more wine, water glasses not refilled, even after seeing the staff come out with 2 pitchers of water, fill the table behind ours and not come to our table. Leaving dishes on the table even after we were finished with our courses. Several staff walked by time and time again leaving dirty dishes on the table. We had to pile them up or point them out in order for the dirty dishes to be removed. It was uncomfortably warm because the door opens every 30 seconds because of the tables outside on the patio. And one of the busing staff smelled strongly of weed. I tried to email the restaurant and not leave a review on Yelp, but they didn&#39;t bother to return my email. The dinner came to $50 a person.

She had the Rigatoni Mama Mia and I had the Lasagna.  I will start with mine. Now I don&#39;t believe I have had a lasagna that I didn&#39;t like, I can say that there are only one or two times where I felt that I had the best lasagna ever.  The last time I said this it was at Giordano&#39;s interestingly enough and since that time they haven&#39;t been able to replicate it.  The lasagna I had from Aliano&#39;s was by far the best I have had.  The meat had a very good flavor to it, there was a decent amount of cheese and sauce but not to the point where it was too much where it ruins the meal. The slice of lasagna held its form together. Excellent and can&#39;t wait to try it again.

My wife allowed me to taste the Rigatoni she ordered. This dish has Italian sausage and a tomato basil cream sauce.  The sauce really made the dish.  I almost liked it more than my lasagna.  

When I ordered it was later in the evening on a Sunday.  The meal was ready in 10 minutes.  The manager, Hugo was very friendly and spent a few minutes with me talking about the restaurant.  I mentioned to him we were going to try over the weekend but my four year old son has a dairy allergy and we didn&#39;t see options on the menu for him.

I ordered eggplant parmigiana which the waiter said was excellent. It was far from excellent not even edible, very thick pieces (3) that when I cut into it was like a sponge, sauce was awful so the little bit of penne that came with it wasn&#39;t very good. The kicker was the waiter came back and asked me how I liked it as he could see I wasn&#39;t eating it and I was honest. I told him I didn&#39;t care for it and he should not recommend this dish. He just walked away from our table never offered a replacement dish or even a refill on my drink. And then to add insult to injury we paid the bill and that dish was still on it. I couldn&#39;t believe that they didn&#39;t even address this. I should have known things would be downhill when they showed up with a basket of dinner rolls instead of the usual Italian bread you would normally see in an Italian restaurant.

The atmosphere inside is really nice, very cozy. The only complaint was that there apparently is no drink menu. There is a wine list, and they have drafts, but no mixed drink menu. Not a big deal for me, i am a beer guy. My wife on the other hand likes mixed drinks. the waitress, who was very nice, told her that they can make anything, but that still didn&#39;t help my date decide.  We had the Calamari for an appetizer, and i had the Luigi Pizza. The pizza is a 12 inch, honestly enough for 2 if you also do an appetizer. The food was really good, and we will definitely be back."

The atmosphere is fantastic, the food delicious, and the staff is amazing!  We just went with a group of 12 and Hugo had a drink in my hand before the last person sat down!

I would absolutely start with the Artichoke Bottoms - which is basically a bruschetta w/artichoke hearts &amp; cheese!  It is OUTSTANDING!  As far as entree&#39;s go, you can&#39;t go wrong with the Gnocchi, but the lasagna may be the best we&#39;ve ever had!  And it&#39;s HUGE!  

I really can&#39;t say enough about what a great find Aliano&#39;s has been!  It&#39;s been a long time that we&#39;ve had food this good, with service to match.  Thank you Hugo &amp; staff for another amazing evening!  We will be back!"

In August 2016, we asked to hold a fundraiser at the restaurant where the restaurant would donate a % of the sales back to our non profit animal rescue group. Not only did Chris agree to the fundraiser, but asked if we would like to hold the fundraiser from Monday - Friday.  YES we did!!!.   We promoted the fundraiser on our FB pages and handed out flyers.  Many people had never eaten at Aliano&#39;s before, so this was a good way to get people out to enjoy a wonderful meal and help raise funds for us.  The positive feedback we received from our group was great!  Everyone loved the food and thanked us for sharing this amazing restaurant with them.  I know several people have become regular customers.    Today, Aliano&#39;s donated a generous check to Hoof Woof &amp; Meow Animal Rescue as a result of all of the people who mentioned our name when dining at the restaurant during the week of August 8-12, 2016.

Then, the calamari is so amazing, flavorful, especially with the little bit of kick of the Aliano&#39;s style, and the perfect, creamy, cheesy artichoke bottoms are nothing less than the best appetizer I&#39;ve ever had, or even heard of! For the entrees, everything I&#39;ve had, from the meat lasagna, to the special salmon, to the steak, everything is always beyond my expectations, which always grow, every time I&#39;m here.

Unfortunately I was not very impressed with the flavors/taste of everything nor the average value/quality of what you get for the high quality level prices. It&#39;s a small place, probably only 10ish tables inside, a group of 6 would take up a third of the place. When we arrived there were 2 other tables and we weren&#39;t greeted even though I saw staff walking to the kitchen and bar in the back, so we sat down, unsure if that is how this place handles seating. The bread was very hard to bite through the crust and just plain slices, no seasoning or dip, we had to ask for butter. Hate to say it but better bread at the OG. We had the Bruchetta with Goat cheese appetizer and couldn&#39;t taste the pesto or balsamic, same note on the bread, as soon as you could finally bite through the crust the whole thing just fell apart, it was messy and average flavor. My boyfriend got gnocchi, about $15 for 15 gnocchi with no meat, although I tasted his sauce and it was good. I got the baked mostaccioli with meatball, the meatball had a very strong herb seasoning to it that was overpowering and again, nothing special about the basic $15 dish. Overall, high prices, flavor/quality wasn&#39;t there, service was just ok."

The fettuccine Alfredo was rich and delicious. The table bread was excellent. Our party also had appetizers which were the artichoke bottoms on French bread they were so good! The baked clams were so so they were a bit dry. The portions were sensible and we came away pretty stuffed. Service was attentive and friendly. Price wise it was about 40 dollars a person, with 2 appetizers and one drink apiece."

Lasagna was good, as was the portion size.  The spaghetti was  good, but didn&#39;t come close to filling up my husband.  Service was decent.

She was multitasking very well, by holding a nice conversation with me, while at the same time making drinks for others and cleaning up the bar top. The food was amazing. I think the gnocchi here is the best I&#39;ve ever had. I got it with the vodka sauce. So good. The location for this restaurant is great in this downtown area.

We love the East Dundee area and all the local offerings so when something new comes to town, supporting that local business is a main objective.  And luckily for us, this place is wonderful!  The place is small but it has a quaint cozy feel.  In the warmer months they will have outdoors seating which is a huge plus as patio drinking is my hobby haha.  We ordered the pinot noir which was fairly good-not the best but certainly not the worst.  We ordered the Goat Cheese Bruschetta as an app and it was so so SO good!  4 pieces in this unique take on an Italian classic!  Highly recommend!  We ordered the wedge salad which was pretty standard and then we shared the Chicken Saltimbocca and Cavatelli Aliano with Arrabbiata sauce (packs a decent spice if you like it hot). Both are very delicious!  The pasta wasn&#39;t quite cooked enough with the Cavatelli but being a new restaurant and working through the kinks I&#39;m hardly going to knock them for it.  We got two cappuccinos, their HOMEMADE limoncello and a piece 5 layer chocolate cake.  All the dishes were very well executed in presentation and taste.  Our server was Hugo-a well spoken, knowledgeable gem!  Service was very attentive although it was just us and three other tables but I am sure there would be no issue in a packed scenario.  Adam-the bus boy-was polite and attentive as well!  It was nice to meet the employees and owner and become familiar with what I hope will be an East Dundee staple. It is on the pricier side but certainly worth every penny!  I must try the Lasagna next time:)"

Their steak is very high quality. It&#39;s nicely seasoned and juicy. Also, their prices are quite reasonable. Three tacos for under $9.00 with rice and beans is more than fair. 

That said, nothing else really thrilled me here. The salsa was straight liquid, almost like soup. The chips tasted a little bit stale, they just didn&#39;t have that love in them. Also, I didn&#39;t care for the marinade on the chicken. And my Coke was watered down.

The service was fair enough, although I wish my water glass hadn&#39;t remained empty for ten minutes without a refill. I just can&#39;t imagine going back here."

I picked up a giant chicken burrito on my home from work.  It was huge first of all and actually pretty delicious!  I&#39;ve had problems with finding good Mexican restaurants in my local area lately so I thought I pass this place almost every day let me try it.  I ordered it at 10p and by 10:15p when I came to pick the burrito up its was done as promised.  I ordered mine with sour cream and guacamole  and loved it.  The chicken was cubed as opposed to shredded which I prefer, but it was still delicious!  The burrito was so big I had it for lunch and dinner again.  $10 for a giant burrito seems a bit much but again it was good.  The place was crowded for it being 10p so I assume they must be good.  I will come back here to try more of their food.  

Now for the one down fall that I saw when I  was waiting in line to pick up my food.  Ugh, a waitress put a basket of chips on a serving tray, took a chip from the basket and ate it.  The waitress proceeded to fill the tray with salsa from the fridge and the customers drinks.  I watched her walk the tray over and place everything on the patrons table.  After The waitress shoved a chip in her mouth she licked her fingers and wipe them on her apron.  Other than seeing that I can&#39;t complain.  I would&#39;ve given them five stars had I not seen the waitress do that."

Right away I called back four times...no answer. Why bother answering the phone then at 12:45 then? I work in account service and I would never do that.

I came here with two co-workers for lunch on Thursday. I&#39;ve frequented the Los Burritos Tapatios in Glen Ellyn, but I&#39;m not sure if and how the burritos mexicanos/tapatios are even related to each other. They all offer similar fare: authentic and quick Mexican.

They have your standard tacos, burritos, and tortas. They have some breakfast dishes as well as some specialties such as enchiladas and fajitas. Similar to many Mexican joints, they offer free chips and salsa for each table. You order at the counter if you are getting it to go, but you take a seat and are waited on if you dine in.

After a quick glance at the menu, I decided I was pretty hungry and I ordered the chicken fajita dinner, which came with rice and beans.

The food came out very quickly, but unfortunately, our waitress was MIA after that. My fajitas were good: lots of onions, tomatoes, and peppers, and a good amount of chicken, too. I wanted more water and more of the salsa that came with the chips, but alas, the waitress never showed up. The place wasn&#39;t super crowded, either. They even had two waitresses but they were super slow. Oh well... Also, I ordered corn tortillas with my fajitas and I believe I got flour (they were white; I&#39;m not saying they weren&#39;t corn but more commonly I see a yellowish hue with corn tortillas; could be way off here).

My coworkers got burritos and they seemed satisfied. I wasn&#39;t amazed by anything with my meal; the food was 4 star but the service and price (13.50 for my plate; no drink included) was 2.5 star-ish.

I won&#39;t be rushing back here but I won&#39;t actively avoid it, either."

This time my Boyfriend  and I both ordered quasidias he got chicken I just got cheese they came out very fast no problem  with that but my Boyfriend  did not receive  the chicken he ordered in his so I asked the women if he could get the chicken ones he asked for she apologized  and said no problem  2 minutes  later brought it back out they literally  just opened  them and threw the chicken  in them. And not to mention he asked for a large drink  and got a medium. The rice we got was also cold and disgusting. To say the very least I will not be returning you have lost my business.

I ordered the skirt steak enchilada combo. It  comes with rice and beans. The steak was really good. The rest not so much. The rice smelled funny. Like it sat on the warming table all day. The beans tasted like stale lard. My wife had tacos. Again the meat smelled funny and was full of fat and grizzle. Two bites of that mess and my wife was done. We vowed we weren&#39;t coming back.  Next it was my grandsons birthday and this is the place he picked. A carbon copy of our first meal. Bad and funny smelling food.  The third ( and last time ) I went with people from work who said this was the best Mexican food in town. This time I had three tacos and no rice and beans. Very marginal. The steak taco was ice boxy. Like it was reheated from yesterday. The chicken taco was dry and off putting. The el pastor was not flavorful.

Today I came in and stood at the counter.
all the waitresses were sitting at a table

was awkward and rude. I almost left.

After hearing how my husband&#39;s experience with his coworkers the day previous to my first visit was so great, I felt I had to try.

We drove back out to Los burritos Mexicanos last week Saturday... Yes, the food was okay, compared to some other Mexican food I&#39;ve had. However, that being said, I don&#39;t appreciate it when I find a hair on my plate (on the bright side, at least it wasn&#39;t hidden in my food, where I couldn&#39;t see it... It was out on the middle of the plate, clear as day).

I came in with a friend on a Friday night. The place was pretty busy and had a lot of staff, which was great. Now I love Mexican food, more than anyone I know, but this was not Mexican, this was taco hell. My friend ordered chicken tacos and I ordered chicken fajitas. When our food came I was hungry and it looked decent. After my first bite, I realized my chicken was not cooked all the way. I chose not to complain, because I am one of those people who believe they do stuff to your food when you complain, but I quickly decided I was full. My friend thought her food was great! Until... 2 hours later she texted me letting me know she thinks she has food poisoning!! This place is nasty! I will not be giving them my service again.

Luckily, I can now feel closer to home as I discovered another Los Burritos Mexicanos location right off 64 and Randall Rd. I say &#34;closer to home&#34; because I frequent the one closer to me in Villa Park quite often. I&#39;ve taken a liking to the chains authentic, friendly and fast service.

I ordered my usual steak burrito, and it was just as good, if not better than the ones I&#39;m familiar with in VP. Something about the steak tasted fresher. Another one of my favorite things about Los Burritos are the salsas. Somethings about the red and green salsa here absolutely rocks my world. Flavorful with the right amount of kick, is how I best describe them. 

My suggestion to people all you people in St. Charles that know nothing about Mexican food outside of Chipotle, put down that $9 &#34;burrito&#34; with rice in it and head on over to Los Burritos Mexicans for some cheap authentic Mexican fare. You&#39;ll be glad you did."

Our meal was terrible!  Sure, the place looks dodgy but if it has awesome reviews, they must be doing something right... right?  
Wrong!  Our food came out about 3 minutes after we ordered it.  Fast and speedy, ok, that&#39;s great.  But when the food tasted as barely mediocre as it did, it makes me wonder if they plated it and then microwaved it.  My enchilada dinner was barely luke warm.  

Most Mexican restaurant dishes taste very similar, no matter which restaurant you go to.  But this food was noticeably different and in a negative way.  The edges of the tortilla were so overdone that I had a hard time chewing it.  A flour tortilla!  It wasn&#39;t even crispy... more like hard and chewy.  

My husband&#39;s burrito had so much water in it, it was leaking all over the place but more so, made for a nasty soggy burrito.  Drain. your. chicken. people.

The service was horrible.  Our server never refilled our drinks.  And she never came over to check on us either.

The salsa here is alright; their chips, however, are nice and tasty. 

Service at Los Burritos Mexicanos is a little spotty. If you don&#39;t know to grab a table without prompting or that you have to pay up at the register, you won&#39;t really be told that. The wait staff isn&#39;t very attentive either -- I can&#39;t imagine what it would be like if the place were packed.

Parking can be an issue here too. They have a very small, private lot and there&#39;s no street or adjacent, alternative parking. My first attempt to come here was unsuccessful because I couldn&#39;t find a spot.

I just moved back to the area from LA and I have definitely been spoiled by SoCal&#39;s amazing Mexican food.

I can&#39;t believe all of the good reviews of this place. 

First of all, the woman at the takeout counter had a very difficult time taking my order. I ordered 2 chorizo burritos, 1 bean and cheese burrito (which she didn&#39;t understand. I thought that was pretty straight forward) and a large horchata. It probably took a good 10 minutes for her to get my order straight. She was going to charge me full price for a bean and cheese burrito which is not standard and a bit ridiculous, so I ended up scratching that. 

The chorizo was NOT good. I&#39;m really not too picky. I might complain, but 9.5 times out of 10 I will at least eat it. I couldn&#39;t even finish this burrito, to be honest. The chorizo just tasted like heavily salted ground beef. It was bland and overwhelmingly salty. My mom, who used to love this place, agreed that it was just bad. 

I also don&#39;t understand why the burritos are $6, when most of the filling is lettuce, beans and tomatoes. I didn&#39;t get chips or anything. Maybe Chicago suburbanites are okay with this, but let me tell you--- incredible Mexican food exists, and this isn&#39;t it.

+2 stars because the horchata was awesome and because my mom says it is usually good."

The waitress&#39; look at your drinks and just walk by or do not ask you for a refill. There were several woman working there just talking and did not check up on me and my friends when we were eating. We were all out of drinks and I had to ask to get refills. When we finished our meal we were not guided where to go after that. We eventually realized that you have to walk up to the register and tell them exactly what you eat in order to pay. They are quite disorganized.

Food: The chicken is slightly watery and greasy. The steak was delicious but they do not give you as much as the chicken (probably because it costs more for steak).
The portion sizes are good and I enjoyed the tacos and quesadillas. My friend loved the burritos; the regular size and giant burritos are both a good choice. If you are starving I would go for a giant burrito. The salsa that they give you is amazing!

Cleanliness: The bathrooms could use improving.. Otherwise I saw no big issues.

Overall: If the service was better: smiling, friendliness, continuously checking up on the customers, asking how the food is, and refilling drinks: then I would come back. The inside was quite chilly, the AC was cranked up high which is not a bad thing if it is not out. The seats were very comfy if you choose the booth.
As for now, I do no think I will come back.

One bonus to dining in is that they serve beer and margaritas, but really that&#39;s not enough of a draw for me to keep coming back.
Last time I went to Los, I had the vegetarian burrito since a friend had suggested it to me.  The server was really sweet and prices are fair, but the food itself left much to be desired.  The burrito was large, but only consisted of beans, lettuce, tomato and rice.  Now, even Qdoba throws in some grilled veggies!  This place is supposed to be authentic Mexican but the burrito lacked any flavor.  I was extremely disappointed both in the burrito itself and my friend for making such a terrible suggestion.  My bf prefers the burritos here to any other local spot, so it may just be the vegetarian burrito that sucks.  While on the topic of vegetarian dishes, they don&#39;t serve gorditas de rajas.  I love those and have found them to be a staple at most places since everywhere has the ingredients...but nope, no gordita for me.
The guacamole is a reasonable portion and fresh, but not my favorite.  It&#39;s very basic: avocado, cilantro, onion and lime.  The chips are good but not as crispy as I&#39;d like.  
I&#39;ve also had their Chile relleno, which was no great shakes.  Everything I&#39;ve tried here has been mediocre at best...except the horchata.  That was pretty good.  
They have great service, are always friendly and prompt, and are open til midnight on most nights (if not 1 a.m.), but Mexican restaurants are run of the mill in the Chicago burbs, and this one doesn&#39;t do anything for me.  I prefer Jalisco off rt 31 when in the STC area."

well, we didn&#39;t have anything to eat. we sat there for nearly ten minutes without acknowledgement from anyone and there were only three other tables sat. a party of four came in and sat right behind us. in under thirty seconds, the server had menus, chips, and salsa...  walked right past us to greet the new party of four and present them with chips and salsa. i grabbed my purse and said, &#34;lets go&#34;. pretty crappy experience.

we won&#39;t go here again, not even for take-out. we went to front street cantina in geneva instead."

My friend and I went there on 05/20/11.  This place is small compared to the restaurants we&#39;ve been to lately.  Once you walk in, it&#39;s almost feels like a semi-fast food semi-restaurant.  You just sit wherever you want (I asked the front before sitting) and wait for the waiter.  Ours came and she offered us drinks, which we chose cokes.  She asked us the size of drink we wanted, regular or large, and we chose large.  Let me tell you, large is LARGE!  The cup probably holds as much drink as an extra large from Taco Bell, if not larger!  Yeah, we were surprised but it was fine because we usually go through two glasses of drinks in other restaurants anyways.

Looking at the menu, they offered side items for the main meal besides having appetizers.  We decided to skip appetizers and just order the main course + 1 side.  I got the mixed Fajitas + 1 cheese quesadilla and my friend got a veggie burrito + 1 cheese quesadilla.  My friend was offered two sizes: regular or large.  The waiter told us that both were the same price, so the choice was large.  Here we go again xD  When our order came to the table, which was less than 10 minutes, he got a HUUGE burrito!  Even Chipotle&#39;s burrito had to bow before its mass!  (Keep in mind that this restaurant is more of a Traditional Mexican Food place)  My Fajitas were as expected, but it looked soo good.

The food was great.  The meats were cooked very good and the tortillas were great as well.  If I had to complain on something, it would be the average taste of the beans and rice...but they were still good.  My friend enjoyed his burrito, though he would&#39;ve preferred more veggies (he&#39;s always saying that :D ).  Now the quesadilla is just AMAZING while hot!  I was surprised how great it tasted, but once the cool settles in, it loses its luster...fair warning ;)  Both of us finished our meals this time.

After all that, the bill came out really cheap compared to the other restaurants we&#39;ve been to.  We might as well ditch any fast food places we go to and come here from now on...just a couple dollars different for better food (well, I still wouldn&#39;t leave Chipotle).  My friend was so shocked (in a good way) at the bill that he couldn&#39;t even laugh, even though he promised to xDD

In summary, this place is AWESOME!!  Great food, cheap prices, fast service...what else can you ask for?  I recommend everyone to try this place out if they get a chance...you&#39;ll love it here!"

They also have great chilaquiles, but definitely spicier than any other chilaquiles I&#39;ve had - just a warning. Los Burrito&#39;s reminds me a lot of Jalapeño Grille (big compliment because that&#39;s one of my favorite places in STC). The only problem I&#39;ve had was today when my coworkers and I decided to get carry-out for lunch, and they forgot to give us the horchata I ordered. But when I called them to inquire about my drink, they were super nice and offered me a free meal to make up for it, which I really appreciated since I had to drive back across town.

Last time I checked they stayed open pretty late (12 or 1am, I think) which makes it a great place for a group to refuel after drinking in downtown St. Charles.

His excuse was that we were over-served which could not be further from the truth. Our behavior for the total minute and half we were there was nothing short of sober. Our efforts to enter another bar in the area  were futile as he had already called all bars in the area telling us we could not be served and that the authorities had been notified.

She is a small girl and was trying to hop up onto the bar stool. She slipped while trying to get on and took a pretty hard fall to the ground. The bouncer rushed in to tell us that we were drunk and had to leave. We had just walked in and were in no way acting drunk or loud and in fact were not drunk. He did not even ask if my friend was okay. He jumped to conclusions. He said we could go across the street to the fox and hound instead. We left and went there. Of course he had already called the fox and hound to let the manager know to expect us. We were greeted at the door by a bouncer who said unfortunately he could not let us in due to the call. We were bummed to hear this, but the bouncer explained the situation and said regardless of what he personally thought of us, because of the phone call he could not let us in. He was very polite about the situation which was appreciated. He agreed that the actions taken were harsh as we were not drunk/rowdy. I am happy to have found out that the snuggery was a terrible establishment before we spent any money there. Please save your time and go elsewhere.

I guess this is pretty standard behavior for all of their employees, as multiple people have written negative reviews about the employees here."

I had never been here before, so I was excited to try it out. Walked in and the music was going and people were dancing, which is great! It was pretty loud in there though, like, really loud. And it was empty on a Saturday night, not a great sign. 

We sat at the bar and pored over the drink menu. I saw they had shot-skis listed as a special and I figured since it was a birthday, I would order one for my friend. I asked the bartender for one and she said they don&#39;t have that.... Okay, so why is it on your menu? I hate when restaurants don&#39;t block things out or updated their menus when something is removed. Obviously, it is expensive to reprint, but take a Sharpie or something and cross it out or whatever. We ordered a round of Sweet Tart shots for our group and the bartender made them up pretty quickly. Those were great, tasted just like candy! We also had a round of shots that tasted like Jolly Ranchers, I don&#39;t remember what they were called, maybe they were Jolly Rancher shots! The shots were great, but the mixed drinks were just okay. I ordered the Snugg-A-Rita, and it was just okay. The birthday girl had a Long Island and it tasted terrible, like garbage water. She didn&#39;t want to return it, so she just drank a quarter of it and had a Coke. In a testament to how loud it was, one of my friends ordered a Corona from the bartender, and she made her a tequila shot. We were literally sitting at the bar, leaning over to talk to the bartender. If you can&#39;t hear the orders, the music is probably too loud. We tried to go dance, but the dance floor was very small, there were lots of tables in the way and people kept bumping into them. You could tell the patrons sitting at those tables were getting a little irritated. 

I think this bar has potential to be a suburban hotspot, but they are right next to Fox and Hound and just ten minutes from America&#39;s bar, both superior bar spots. Also, they are in a terrible location. If you didn&#39;t already know it was there, you would never find it. If they cleaned up a bit, it could be a great place! Also, the bartenders could be a little nicer. Like, I don&#39;t know if it was because we were all women, but they seemed almost bothered by our presence. We all bought alcoholic drinks and left a tip, so I don&#39;t understand the attitude. Not okay. I might go back, but not for a night out."

Everyone was awkwardly spaced out, and there were a lot of creepy guys just drinking by themselves. My friends and I grabbed the only three seats at the bar that were together, and after just a few minutes of sitting there we noticed it smelled REALLY gross. I don&#39;t know what in the world it was, but we left after just one drink. 

I noticed a few days later that they put a $50 charge on the card that I used to buy the one drink. I called to speak with a manager about it and after being hung up on and calling back, a woman explained to me that they always do that just in case someone walks out without paying. Shouldn&#39;t you warn people about this before you take their credit cards...? I mean, I only got one drink! It just seemed super sketchy, and the manager on the phone wasn&#39;t even the least bit apologetic. My friend got an overdraft fee for the $50 charge on her card so sorry but the explanation of &#34;it&#39;ll fall off your account in 4 days&#34; doesn&#39;t cut it.

The &#34;bartenders&#34; were clearly too busy talking to each other to notice my hails so I could get my check and leave. When I spoke to the manager and mentioned the slow pace, he started interrogating me as to why I was unhappy. 

The real kicker came when I got my bill and there was a $50 place holder fee on my bill. It&#39;s like they assume you to be a thief, even though I gave them my credit card and opened a tab. Why tack on a $50 place holder when you already have a person&#39;s credit card?

Owned by the same restaurant group that owns Finn McCool&#39;s and Moretti&#39;s, the menu is similar to Finn&#39;s, even with some of the same burgers, entrees, and appetizer items.  Some things that stood out as different on the menu were the fajitas, broasted chicken, and fresh cut fries.  I was debating with one of my table mates that the fries here are 100x better than the fries at Finn&#39;s, because the&#39;re fresh cut and not that crinkle-cut frozen ish.  Apparently, he prefers the taste of freezer burn.

Decor is standard to this restaurant group, it seems that all of their restaurants are basically the same on the inside.  Service was decent, they&#39;re not knocking it out of the park, but they&#39;re not lagging behind, either.

$5 &#34;Snug burger&#34; on Tuesdays, which is also trivia night.  How do you argue with that?  The burger was cooked as I ordered it and came hot and ready to be devoured."

I didn&#39;t expect much from the outside and their location next to the cleaners but the inside has a lot space and is very clean. They also have an outside area. It was fairly empty but I am shocked that people review that it is over crowded. Must be a late crowd?

The only time I like to pay a cover is if there is a live band - something actually worth paying the extra money for.

 I noticed that there was a younger crowd, which was good. They have a decent dance floor, but hardly anyone was dancing and it was like 1AM. We approached the bar and ordered 2 lemon drop shots (which were small compared to other places I have been). They were $6 each. Rip.Off. After that we waited for a long time for a bartender to get back to us about ordering another drink or closing out the tab. We ended up leaving just because we didn&#39;t feel like being the only people on the dance floor dancing.

I&#39;ve been to bars that don&#39;t excel at being a dive or sports but at least there&#39;s some kind of saving grace. There&#39;s none here. 

The bartender Hannah was terrible, not helpful, didn&#39;t listen to me when I asked to keep my tab open, very sloppy pouring drinks (and very weak pour too), preferred to party behind the bar instead of work.  The beer was watered down, music way way too loud (Fox and Hound got better at this. Snuggery was much worse). My friends were pretty much turned off and just ruined our nights, definitely don&#39;t plan on coming back here. 

Stick to Fox and Hound next door (which isn&#39;t saying much since I get hit-or-miss service there, prefer the Arlington Heights location way more). At least the bartenders seem like they kind of care about their customers and the management far more responsive plus way better beer selection...I&#39;d rather pay more for better experience than what we got.  Granted, it still feels like an annoying let&#39;s-get-wasted bar which didn&#39;t help but what can you do?

If you want karaoke, go somewhere else, ANYWHERE else.  At the very least, until Snuggery gets better bartenders and pays better attention to their kegs."

We came here after losing our softball games to drown our sorrows a few times last summer.  We experienced some particularly bad (see: horrific) service twice in a row, and we stopped coming back.  We chose to take our business elsewhere.

Well, this summer, we decided to give this place one more chance, and I am really glad we did!  The manager (who desperately tried to help with our service issue from last summer) actually remembered us when we returned and went as far as to make it up to us TWICE now.

He didn&#39;t need to do that, but he went out of his way to make it right.  That&#39;s what I call good customer service, because we have since been back a few times!  

The food is good--typical bar food, but they have good specials.  I usually get the broasted chicken on Sunday nights.  It&#39;s four pieces of chicken, coleslaw, mashed potatoes and a salad.  It&#39;s pretty cheap and really good.

The service was quite solid. My friend and I came to watch the Rangers vs Capitals in Game 7. So we requested the tabletop speakers to get some volume. No less than six speakers died within a half hour. The bartender and manager kept working on it until early in the third we got a speaker that worked for the rest of the game. Major props for that. And I only got charged for one beer, despite drinking three. That was pretty outstanding by them.

As for the food...well, it was ok. Passable. The chicken fingers were fair. Juicy, but not crisp. I appreciate the fries being fresh-cut, that makes a big difference for me., but still not very crisp. I also had the Captain Morgan seared shrimp, which are grilled, doused with BBQ sauce, and served on onion straws.  Six pretty small shrimp and the BBQ sauce tasted more like a Buffalo sauce for me. I wouldn&#39;t order that one again.

All in all, it was fine, but this place is a 45 minute drive from me and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth that long a drive for me to go back. So you could do worse, you could do better too."

We stopped coming here when it closed, because were not interested in the weekend jersey shore vibe as were in our mid 30&#39;s and just liked to drink outside.

We came in on a random evening 1/17/2013 (which if you notice the other reviews from the same evening it seems we all have similar gripes) kind of celebrating a small work related victory...

Right from the start the service was brutal. There were THREE bartenders behind the bar and we waited 20 minutes to order our first round of drinks and food, there couldn&#39;t have been more than 15 people in the entire bar at this point, so not OK.

The night went downhill from there...the girls behind the bar were either texting, talking, going out for breaks etc, getting their attention was impossible, drinks were delivered wrong or never delivered at all, the barback was actually tending bar for a while (he&#39;s awesome by the way) and at the end of the night we had a complete billing nightmare that is STILL going on one week later.

I&#39;m not sure what happened between summer and now, but we won&#39;t be back. Ever.

Note to young, female bartenders...when a group of mid 30&#39;s professionals come in to drink and were all ordering top shelf liquor and are running up tab&#39;s of $300 or so, PAY ATTENTION TO US!

They have some drink specials which they post on the website.  The Friday special of a whipped martini was pretty bad... don&#39;t waste your money.  I love vodka and I dumped mine.

The service was pretty slow and even though we had a table, I found myself going to the bar quite a bit to get a drink.  I hope this is just because they are new and will improve.  

The DJ was cool and mixed a bunch of music by request... both new and old songs.  Towards the end of the night, the Snuggery invited girls to come and dance on the bar for free shots... always a plus in my book.

We had tried to go to the Fox and Hound which is right down the street, but it was SO packed that we couldn&#39;t find seats! So I found this place on Yelp and we wandered over. 

From the moment we walked in I knew we made the right choice! We were greeted at the door by someone who was taking bets for the game and asked if we wanted to participate. We were able to find a seat right away, and our server promptly came over to take our drink order. During the entire three hours that we were there our server did a great job of making sure we had drinks and food and anything else that we needed without being disruptive. This was impressive because this place was packed, but it&#39;s not the reason that the Snuggery gets four stars...

OMG The stuffed mushroom caps are TO DIE FOR! Ever since I came here on that rainy day last fall I have been craving them! They stuff their mushroom tops with cream cheese and herbs and then deep fry them. They are huge, and they are beyond amazing! The other food we had there was good to, but nothing compared to the amazingness of the stuffed mushrooms! 

The snuggery is a sports bar. It is not a healthy eating kind of place. It is not the kind of place where one goes to sip wine. It is loud. It is filled with sports fans watching the game. They have pub grub for food, and your standard beers for drinks. However, I do love me a sports bar ESPECIALLY when one of my favorite teams is on, and the Snuggery is exactly what I need!"

SERVICE IS THE WORST. Waiting Waiting and more Waiting. Our waitress was disappearing all night.  Good 20-30 minutes between getting a drink. Forgetting our food order, very simple appetizers. There are far too many bars and restaurants out there to go here. The very weak poured drinks didnt help either. Most of the employees that work in that bar have an attitude. Corporate really needs to clean house. If we are spending $200+ on a night out i dont need a waitress/bartender serving me her side eye."

They take your order and they don&#39;t give you change. For example, a Bug Light bottle is $3.25. mmmk! I hand over $4 and the chick brings back my beer...no change thou. I decided, whatever that&#39;s fine I want to hang out w/ my friends.

I go to the bar next to order my second beer. SAME THING HAPPENS. I was immediatly ignored after I was handed my beer (same thing happened except this time I gave her a $5) OHK! Didn&#39;t know there was automatic gratuity! I asked for my change back and didn&#39;t give her a tip. I was really turned off. She could have turned on her acting skills and pretended like she forgot about my change. 

Anyway, the bathrrom has 2 stalls. Thank GOD there is no bathroom attendant. Oh God, those people are the worst. Do I really have to tip you?? And this place is pretty packed, which is a good thing but not really cause its basically like a square and the bar takes up like 75% of the place, leaving little space for customers. 

I had a bad experience getting a cab back to O&#39;Hare. The cab driver was pretending to hit on me. I asked him how much it would be and he&#39;s like ohhh I will give you a discount, blah blah you&#39;re so beautiful,blah blah PUKE!! He charged me $60 to get to O&#39;hare...Ohh a discount from $68. WOW! ANd he made me go to an ATM cause he said &#34;Oh if you use credit card I cant give u discount&#34;. 
I was in a mood and didn&#39;t feel like arguing over the fare. He was sketchy though. This will teach me a lesson to be extra careful if I have to take an expensive cab ride again. 

Place has no dance floor. People are young and lively. I dunno. Schaumberg bars don&#39;t really do it for me."
snuggery-schaumburg,Phil S.,asP08n8OwVhIg2hyff8DFQ,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,1,0,133,98,XvlrcQojX1IL0sujomeWTw,2.0,2012-03-09,"I tried to like this place since I can literally walk back home if I get drunk but alas, it was not meant to be.  I&#39;ve sat inside at a high top while watching a drunken office party get drunker with the shots the DJ was awarding for silly behavior, I&#39;ve sat at the bar and I&#39;ve sat outside on the patio. I&#39;d say trying to like this place 5 times is giving it way more than a fair chance.

Food: Crappy, frozen Sysco deep fried junk. Not that I expect much better from a bar but this place just looks nicer than that so I was disappointed. Everything from the fries, wonton wrapped mozzarella sticks (ew, do not try these), beer nuggets (even worse), burgers and their specialty.... broasted chicken. It all tastes mediocre to downright horrible. Even at bar food standards.

Drinks: They have specials but like a bloody mary with a sidecar of beer. I know, sounds weird but that&#39;s why I tried it. When I asked the waitress why I wasn&#39;t given my side of beer she told me that the bartenders always forget and if I really wanted it she would go back and force them to give her one. Really? *buzzer* NEXT! After that I just stuck to the cheapest draft beer they had. My wife said their margarita was way too sweet and just sucked in general.

Atmosphere: On weekend nights they have a DJ and he does a decent cheesy job of getting already drunk people to do more dumb drunk things so I guess that&#39;s entertaining. They have plenty of TV screens as well if you really need to watch the game. Personally, I&#39;m not one that really likes the douchebag crowd that comes in wearing a tank top, sagging jeans and a straight bill hat and you&#39;ll see plenty of this species come through here with their flava-flav chains hanging around their pasty white necks. If you don&#39;t like that either then definitely don&#39;t hang out here. 

One time while seated outside, the wait staff repeatedly ignored us for a good 15 mins. Thankfully I flagged down what looked like a manager (it was a busy night BTW) and he was very gracious and apologetic and bought our first round of drinks as compensation... or so we thought. When the check finally arrived, after we got sick of waiting eons for our next round of drinks, the waitress must&#39;ve counted the empty glasses on our table (they didn&#39;t even bother clearing those off, that&#39;s why the glasses were still there) to tally up our bill. I was so sick of waiting that I just paid the bill but didn&#39;t bother with a tip. In fact, I probably could&#39;ve just walked away and not even paid the bill and our waitress wouldn&#39;t have cared. That&#39;s how unconcerned they were with service.

Summary: Kinda like Fox and Hounds a couple blocks north except smaller. They have an outdoor area which is nice if the skeeters aren&#39;t out munching on your legs but other than that pretty much the same gimmick. Avoid unless you really must but between F&amp;H I&#39;d pick this place."

The &#34;dance floor&#34; is just moved over tables to create a space. Not a lot of room. They do allow women to dance on the bar though, get free shots (which they randomy give out for doing things - pretty cool). The DJ is some old guy ( at least every time I&#39;ve been there it&#39;s the same guy) who needs to just stop.

They do have a large outside area, which maybe a part of the hotel that sits behind the bar, but it&#39;s pretty much as big as the bar itself. I do like that area.

There is also a 7-11 like 50 feet away which rules when you run out of cigarettes. 

The service in the bar is okay. When it&#39;s crowded it gets laggy. I really only like this bar when I&#39;m drunk because otherwise there really isn&#39;t anything special. Like I said there is no actual dance floor and it&#39;s a small place."

I am a husky guy, and my best friend, her husband, and I decided to come out for just a beer or two. Living in Portage Park, it was a drive, but we knew someone there. Upon our first drink, we simply got two beers and a cocktail. The waitress said she needed to replenish a bottle to fill the drink, which was fine. I stood there for approximately ten minutes, being ignored by the bartender. Finally I walked back to the table, and gave up. The person who wanted the drink went up to the bar and eventually got her drink. We enjoyed a few cocktails, then drove the husband back home. 

When we arrived back to the bar (had to pick something up), we ordered a beer, two shots, and a cocktail. After ordering, we realized it was near closing. We drank our cocktails, and at 20 minutes until closing attempted to order one more. The same bartender advised us they were done serving, and walked away before we could say anything. Upon walking away, she went to pour 10+ shots for another party. When confronted she told us that they were only serving shots. We ordered 2 shots, and closed. The price was extremely high, and the service was, to say the least, degrading. The bartender was hanging out with her friends and closing, without even recognizing us. 

The bar closed, the manager made things right, without even knowing we had an issue.

What I might suggest to the management is, re-structure the weekly food and drink specials, have karaoke nights or something unique once a week, and seriously work on your customer service. 

Two stars. Did not order food, but I am sure I would have given 3 stars if that was the case."

When the check came the burger was listed as $7.99 and not $5.  She changed it after I asked her about it but it kind of seems in line with some of the shady billing practices that other people have talked about.  My Diet Coke was fine and was refilled at least.  I most likely would not go back."

Cliffs Notes: I wouldn&#39;t go here again. Ever.

The night I went, it happened to be raining(nearly pouring), so naturally I wore a jacket/zip-up hoodie type thing. I walked up to the door and the bouncers basically pushed me away and told me that nobody could have a hood on their clothing (mine was off my head since I was underneath an awning at this point). Uhm, okay...? I understand dress codes like having to wear shoes, shirts, pants, and hats that can&#39;t be on a certain way. That I understand. I could also understand not wearing the hood inside, after all, I have no reason to wear it, its not raining inside! Anyways, I walked back to my car, which happened to be in the far back lot past the 7-11 (the parking lot was packed). I finally got in, near soaked from walking in the rain without a jacket and hood, and I met up with some friends. They had a waitress that was serving them, but it took me over 45 minutes to get a drink. She was non-existent the majority of the night. So I finished my beer and was waiting to flag her down for another. Never saw her again the entire night. So I fought my way up to the bar and finally ordered another round. This place blows!"

The parking lot is tiny and also next to a hotel so parking it hard to come by. If you insist on coming here I recommend getting dropped off or just parking across the street. Inside the bar it was packed to say the least and the &#34;dance floor&#34; was pathetic. Since there is no room to move they let hot girls get up on the bar for free shots...WOOO how degrading and annoying.
I was determined not to return but after being bribed with free drinks I agreed to meet some friends there..only to confirm my dislike towards this bar. There was a loud siren that I don&#39;t remember from last time that seemed to go off every 5 minutes. When I asked someone why it went off they had no idea. Ugh. 
The only saving grace of this bar was the outdoor area which I didn&#39;t go to on my first visit. There are lots of tables and a few intimate areas with low couches which was nice. Bad part about the outdoor area was that there weren&#39;t any speakers so we only heard the dull bass of the music playing inside. Also there was NO service outside. The few waitresses that were out there just hung around their friends, picked up empties, brought their friends new drinks and continued this cycle the entire time I was outside."

Came here on a Saturday night and sat at a table. Make sure you don&#39;t wear a hat because the bouncer was a dick to my friend about his. he said he should have left it in the car when we took a cab. Anyways, the inside is a decent size. They have a lot of TVs - some were playing sports, some playing music videos for the songs the DJ was playing, and some randomly playing America&#39;s funniest home videos. They had waitresses serving the tables all night which was nice so you didn&#39;t have to fight the crowd at the bar. 

They have a nice outside area but it was a little chilly so I only got to see it from inside. 

The DJ played good music, a lot of dance and rap and hip hop, and eventually some over-served girls took it upon themselves to dance on the bar which was pretty entertaining. 

All in all a good time. Cool crowd and good drinks and prices. I would go back but would probably like to try somewhere else first."

I was here this past Friday night, I was the DD so I wasn&#39;t drinking. To get a bartender to refill a coke was next to impossible, and came with an eye roll and snotty attitude. I was tipping with each drink and bartend as well. A sober driver should be encourage by establishments not feel uncomfortable. They did last call at 2:30 am, served several drinks to several people and than immediately at 2:35 began blowing this loud, obnoxious horn continually. Didn&#39;t give anyone a chance to finish. Pushed people out. I get what it&#39;s like to want to get out early, but if you want people out of your establishment you change the hours of operation. Don&#39;t advertise you are open until 3am when if reality you want everyone out at 2:30 am. In this case they should have done last call at 2 to have everyone out at 2:35. I politely attempted to speak with 2 different men that were working the door along with several other annoyed guests. I was told to go to corporate about it, that it is policy to do that, and nothing can be done. That&#39;s great,  because I will. When I go out, drinking or not, I at least expect to be respected. I will not be going back here, and it&#39;s ashame because we all work close and this use to be out place to go.

I can tell that they are cheap frozen wings which they claim are &#34;The largest fresh, never frozen wings available!&#34;, which were not cooked correctly.  The wings that were actually cooked close to crispy were wimpy and had hardly any meat.  Most of them were underdone and honestly turned my stomach, I left half of them with 1 bite taken out.

I even tried to hide outside with my smoker friends (oh the place have heaters when it&#39;s cold outside), and that didnt work. I finally gave up and left. The free valet is also nice as the parking lot is pretty tiny. I will probably go back and give it a few more tries."

It is a pretty typical sports bar, but  the food was surprisingly good. I had nachos, and my coworker had chicken wings and the mahi dinner. He had been craving chicken wings, and they did it for him. There were TVs everywhere, including at the table. They had a contest going on. It was a trivia game of some sort. It seemed like it would be fun. The crowd was very diverse. The service was standard. It was nothing special but not bad either. We got to sit quickly and service was prompt. The bar was loud, but as it was a sports bar, that makes sense. I left feeling very satisfied. They also offer a shuttle service. So if you know you will be drinking, you can call for a ride there and a ride home, which is awesome and a way to keep crazy drunks off the street. I like that they are making the streets safer one drunk at a time. I would go back to The Snuggery if I was in the area again."

I should have known from the get-go that that this wasn&#39;t going to work out gwell.  I called around 6 PM.  I told the girl that answered the phone that I wanted to place and order for carryout. She put me on hold for a couple of minutes.  A different girl picked up the phone and I said I wanted place an order and she put me back on hold for a few more minutes.  When she picked up the phone again I told her that I wanted to order a dozen buffalo wings with bleu cheese.  She asked me what sauce and I said medium--but I asked if it had a kick to it.  She suggested the Captain Morgan Rum Sauce would probably be good if I like a little spice.  I said okay-to which she replied it would be about 30-45 minutes because they had a huge party they were cooking for.  After hesitating I agreed. When I got there I expected the place to be full but really there was one larger group at two tables and basically the whole place was maybe at 25% of their capacity and most of them were just drinking.    The host table was abandoned and most of the waitresses were engaged in conversation. After standing there like an idiot for a few minutes,  I went to the bar area and the bartender had someone bring the food out and she said the total was $10.  Apparently the food and bev tax is 20% because the wings were only $7.99 on the menu.  I don&#39;t care too much as I would have tipped them but I think they were just adding tips all along the way which just furthered added to my disgust.  It was an even $10 too-what are the chances!  To add fuel to the fire, I checked to make sure they put the sauce in the bag when I got to my car--and they put in a cup of ranch--which I hate.  Not to mention it was like the consistency of milk......the menu says it comes with bleu cheese....doesn&#39;t even mention ranch and I specifically requested bleu cheese.  I also did not like the sauce on the wings.  The chicken itself looked good--was meaty but the smell of the sauce and the taste was awful.  Some people probably like it--but it was not for me.  I maybe ate 3 of them.  My husband also complained that the smell was terrible.  I am sure I would have enjoyed them more with a more traditional sauce.  All in all--was not impressed.  The actual place looks nice--lots of TVs and good outdoor seating area but all in all a bad experience for a diner.  Maybe is a lot more enjoyable after a few beers."

The layout is way better than the last place (Kitchen Bar), it&#39;s way more open &amp; has a cozy feeling.  We were greeted by a team of girls, some were waitresses &amp; 1 was a hostess.  Considering it was opening week, the place was empty, which wasn&#39;t a bad thing but it was surprising.  Lots of tvs everywhere, including a small one at each booth, so it was perfect to watch the games that were on.  I had the snug burger, which was really good, a lot bigger than I expected but the price was reasonable &amp; it came with fresh cut fries which were tasty.  My buddy asked how the chicken fingers were &amp; the waitress was honest &amp; said shes had better, which I can appreciate, can&#39;t stand those that say something is fantastic &amp; it ends up being nasty.  Service was good enough, a little slow but I understand they&#39;re still getting used to things.  Our server was hoarse from working the later shift, but recommended to visit later at night when it&#39;s more crowded.  If she was hoarse just trying to take orders, I can imagine that trying to converse with your friends have a similar after effect.  Great place for lunch or dinner, but I&#39;ll wait til the hype dies down before coming in for a late night out."

Took two bites and in the garbage it went. I wouldn&#39;t dare  give to my  dogs. I never saw such a skinny hot dog in my life just a spackle of  chili and maybe 10 shreds of cheese. I wish my phone wasn&#39;t dead cause I really wanted to take a picture of it cause I still can&#39;t believe I spent 4.47 for that awful horrid item.

The woman makes the dogs and leaves them on the table.  Then the guy starts making the fries.  It was painfully slow with nothing to do but look around.  Half of the drink choices had little out of order notes on them.  I over hear the two employees talking and one asks what another customer was complaining about and she says it was about you not wearing gloves while handling food.  So I finally get my order to go and when I get home the dogs are ice cold and one fry is missing.  Pathetic.

I loved their fries...some were crispy, some were soggy but all tasted really delicious. What I would love is if they added some sauces for the fries (a few creative options) to make them even better.

All hot dogs come wrapped with an order of french fries, bringing back memories of going to UIC and getting Maxwell&#39;s. 

Franchisee Dog - stuffed with cheese, wrapped in bacon, deep fried with BBQ sauce for $4.05. Now this was a good hot dog. The hot dog itself was great but the combination of everything else made it to die for. I&#39;ve never had a francheeze with BBQ sauce before or even deep fried and I thought both little changes lent themselves well to this dog.

Slaw Dog - hot dog topped with a ton of homemade coleslaw for $3.35. It really is a ton of coleslaw! So much! Another interesting dog I had to get because I&#39;ve had a lot of dogs in my days but nothing like this. I&#39;m not a big fan of coleslaw but felt like I had to order it the way everyone on Yelp was raving about it. I have to say - I get it. All the raving is justified.

You can make any hot dog a double for a dollar more or make it a combo &amp; get 2 hot dogs, fries and a medium pop. 

I need to try the Southern now! I don&#39;t know how I didn&#39;t see this one before ordering but pulled pork on a dog? Yes please. Just Hot Dogs &amp; More has so much potential. There isn&#39;t a hot dog joint like them in the &#39;Burbs and those fries are some of the best I&#39;ve had in awhile. My two cents - they should focus on the dogs. Add more creative options and cut the other stuff from the menu, making it a destination spot for the coolest and tastiest dogs outside the city!"

I used to live in Berwyn and had easy access to the best hot dog, beef and pizza joints.  Haven&#39;t found anything truly comparable out here until now.  Just Hot Dogs has a classic chicago hot dog along with some specialty dogs. I&#39;m not the best person to rate a hot dog (I like a good dog just not enough to get excited), but the hubby was very happy and actually tried to convince me to go back the next day for more.  

I had the beef and it was great.  I will tell you all the things it was not: 
It was not too thick
It was not over cooked
It was not seriously over or under seasoned
It was not fatty, veiny, or grisly
It was not necessarily the &#34;perfect&#34; beef but it was really good and admittedly I have caught myself day dreaming about it more than once.  
For the super picky beef eater: the bread is good, not sure what kind but it&#39;s good.  Mozzarella was nice and melted. Giardiniera was mild. Did not try sweet peppers.

The fries: they are every bit of deliciousness that everyone has been saying.  Really.  I had so called &#34;fresh cut&#34; fries somewhere else the very next day and they were no where near as good as the beautiful fried loved I was served at Just Hot Dogs. 

No service issues during our visit. Its really laid back. Typical walk up, place your order and wait to be called. 

Their only fault in my opinion is the name and the location.  I&#39;ve driven past a hundred times and always thought &#34;Why would I want to go there if all they serve is hot dogs. What if they&#39;re not even very good hot dogs.&#34; Well, they are good dogs and I&#39;m glad I trusted the reviews and gave Just Hot Dogs a try."

If it were closer to me, I could see myself going much more often.  As is, I have been a couple times now and have tried out a couple of their dogs, and they are pretty darn good.  I love the variety of dogs that they have.  14 different types, spanning the nation, to meet peoples needs.

Because they are called &#34;Just Hot Dogs&#34;, I did find it a bit weird that they have a full menu of other things (Italian Beef, Sausage, Meatball Sandwiches, Pizza Puffs, Tamales, etc).  To date, I have gone with the Cheese dog, Chili Cheese, Franchisee, and Chicago Style (for comparison reasons).  Each are good in their own way.  While I would still prefer a Chicago Style from Gene &amp; Judes or Nana&#39;s, this was very good and would rank just a shade behind the others.  Because of proximity though, I would more likely go here than to G&amp;J.  Fries are excellent.  Love the fresh cut fries that most hot dog places are doing now.  Makes a huge difference, in my opinion.

All in all, I won&#39;t make a special trip up there just to eat, but if I am in the area during lunch time, I will definitely be looking to go.  Check it out, if you get a chance.

Note:  The map location on Yelp is wrong for this place.  For those that are familiar, it is located on the North East side of Spring Hill Mall, across the street, one store south of Aldi&#39;s."

I might be crazy thinking that someone working in a fast food establishment would have some sort of people skills. I was watching him bring out the beef from the back, it was not soaking in juice, must have pulled it straight from the fridge. Then he placed the refrigerated beef  in a container with juice and let it sit for a few minutes. Definitely one of the worst Italian combos I had!!!

I ordered three hot dogs, 2 of them included ketchup. The one teenager sweeping the floor said out loud &#34;Ketchup?!?!! Ketchup?!?! oh ketchup!&#34; I didn&#39;t realize what this meant until I actually received the hot dogs. When we actually opened up the food and tasted it. My hot dog with &#34;ketchup&#34; obviously had the ketchup bottle poured with water to make that happen. The onions were extremely old and shouldn&#39;t be consumed by any human being. Old and tasted like garbage. The hot dog &#34;meat&#34; itself tasted old. Like it was sitting in boiling water for hours and hours before I had come in.  They probably made it in the morning before their first customer (me) showed up at 7 PM.  I&#39;m just praying now I don&#39;t get sick after taking a few bites into that atrocity. I&#39;m very easily pleased and never have left a review before but I feel so cheated I just had to.

While I was there and waiting for my 3 hot dogs for me and my family, I overheard a conversation from the 2 male teenagers working, who apparently, are in charge at this time of night. It involved waiting to clean the fryer until tomorrow, because they think it should be ok. The conversation then progressed into a much more personal area, right in front of me. Apparently, there is drama going on where one guy is mad that the teenager sweeping the floor, is friends with 2 girls even though one of them hates him and cheated on him. The two also talked about how one of their friends would certainly do horrible things behind each others back. He didn&#39;t respect &#34;bro code&#34;. I was the only one in the restaurant (obviously after tasting their horrible food) and could clearly hear these two teen males talk about their sex life and their friends. Never have I felt so cheated out of my $10. Avoid at all costs.

I edited this review just to add that my wife took one bite and almost vomited because the onions and tiny skinny hot dogs were so bad. At this point we are hoping no one gets sick. I also threw away all of the food. During the holidays, $10 is a lot to just trash while you are out and about looking for Christmas presents. The fries and hot dogs were the worst. I&#39;m very easily satisfied usually, but I feel like my health was actually threatened by this horrible food."

As we approved the restaurant a fairly commonly found statue of a giant hot dog applying ketchup to himself so no one would want to eat him was visible right in front. Soon after I walked in I discovered that the name &#34;Just Hot Dogs&#34; is a lie as they have fries, Italian beef sandwiches and tamales. I placed my order for a hot dog and fries and within a few minutes my food was ready.

The hot dog here came on a regular non-poppy seeded bun. The bun was well steamed, soft and just a little bit greasy. The sausage used was a natural casing dog that was heated very well. The relish and onion applied to the dog were perfect fits though the hot dog was a little light on mustard. I did not detect any celery salt on it, but it&#39;s possibly it could have been applied sparingly. The sport peppers were evenly applied through the length of the hot dog and a long and thick pickle and two large tomato slices were right next to it. The pickle was a little bit on the thick side and the tomato slices were a little too watery, but outside of that this was an excellent hot dog. 

The bigger star of the show here was the french fries. Normally when I see fresh cut fries I cringe. The reason being around 90% of the time the only way to salvage them is to add chilli, cheese or some combination of the two. These were some of the best tasting fresh cut fries I&#39;ve come across. Whatever they cook them in gives it more of a sweet taste than salty.

Overall I&#39;d say the hot dog is four stars here and the fries were five. Due to friendly service and a clean restaurant, I&#39;ll round up the score and give this place a five star rating and a recommendation."

Comparison to Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s is not hard to make, other than Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s does not have a tomato slice on their dogs and the fries are on top.  

The hot dogs are typical Chicago-style Vienna hot dogs.  The buns were soggy though and the sport peppers were tiny so points must be deducted for that. 

The fries were of the home cut variety and very good.   

The menu is spartan, and I was disappointed that a side of fries comes in only one size (large), yet a two dog special comes with a small fry.  In other words, they are capable of doing up a small order of fries, yet you cannot order one.

I thought the prices were a bit high for what you get and I was also disappointed with their policy requiring a $10 minimum order to use a credit/debit card.  

All in, it was an &#34;OK&#34; experience, but I probably will not rush back."

The price is about right for what you get.  If you&#39;re looking to spend $1 per dog, I suggest 7 Eleven.  Chances are you won&#39;t get the same quality.  Vienna beef isn&#39;t cheap.

I understand Gene&#39;s &amp; Jude&#39;s is the comparable place but at least this dog joint allows you to have ketchup for your fries.  

I have frequented this place so often that they now deep fry my dogs every time I come in.  Try it next time!  They are crispy and delicious.  
Not a hot dog fan?  Try the italian beef.  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be disappointed.

Great all-around place for a quick bite."

Boy was I happy to find this place!  Glad I found it on yelp first because I may never have seen it from the street. 

They were only open till 7pm tonight and we got there about 6:30. It was empty but my family and I were greeted by the owners as soon as we walked in.  He asked if we had ever been there before and when I said no he cheerfully explained the combo options and how they also offered Italian beef, corn dogs,tamales and pizza puffs as well.  Very pleasant. 

I got a two dog special (Chicago dogs) with no relish, my son got a corn dog and a strawberry crush, and my wife got a cheese dog and a tamale.  They made a mistake on my special (relish) and invited on mKing a couple of fresh dogs for me even though I said it was not a big deal.  Very customer oriented.  

Everything was so good I ordered a couple of more tamales before we finished.   The whole family was very pleased and satisfied."

He decided one day, that he was going to take me, since we both love trying new places around the area. And let me tell you, I am a loyal fan and customer....and here&#39;s why.

1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. To me, customer service fixes a lot of things about poor restaurants. And you&#39;ll be happy to know, neither disappoint here. The first time I walked in (and every single time since), I have been greeted at the door before I even reach the counter. They actually take the time to talk to you, so you don&#39;t feel rushed at all to order. Not like a place where they just keep the line moving without any personal customer connection. They have so many regulars, it&#39;s crazy....and they know them ALL by name, and what their order is.

2. Their food is great. I am a Chicago-style hotdog enthusiast, and I want you to relax because this place has got it down! Everything from the celery salt, to the pickle spear, and to the Vienna Beef dog, it is pure Chicago. They have a variety of other options as well like italian beef, pizza puffs, etc. But other than the dogs, their fries are to die for. Superbly hand cut fries with thick sea salt sprinkled on them, they are fried to a perfect, golden deliciousness. I could eat those things all day, and sure enough on several occasions, I have found myself craving them!!!

All in all, I would recommend this place (and I have to quite a few people) to anyone who loves a good classic Chicago-style dog and fries. They have a good selection of other options, too if that is not your thing. But I implore you to give this place a try, and support your local area food establishments!!!!"

It&#39;s kind of funny, the sandwich board by the street says Just Hot Dogs, and then right below it, says Fresh cut fries.  I always see it and think, I thought it was just hot dogs?  Anyways........

All the people here are very friendly, and you can get your dog or polish regular or Chicago style.  regular has mustard ketchup onions and relish, Chicago adds a pickle and tomatoes, subtracts the ketchup.  they wrap the dogs with the fries a la Gene and Jude&#39;s.  They have a couple of tables outside on the sidewalk, so I ate out there.  Had to go back in for napkins because there were none in my bag.  So I unwrapped the Polish, and it&#39;s fried, not to a crisp, but to a crispy enough, i guess, it was done perfectly!  Got grilled onions mustard and ketchup, the grilled onions were sweet, not so overcooked that they have no give, slightly crunchy were those onions.  Now the fries.  These were some good fries.  They were great fries, some of the best fries I&#39;ve had in a long time!  Hand cut, crispy, and they taste like fries should; like fried potatoes with salt on them.  No gimmicks needed, no batter or weird BK covering, just potatoes, oil and salt.  

So come here and make sure you get the fries, anything else you get is at your discretion, but the fries, one way or another, need to be eaten by you!

Also, they have a sign up that says $10 min. for credit card.  Just try to use your card and see what they say, I had no trouble using mine, and my meal was only $5.46

Happy eating!"

Hot dogs were your typical Chicago style, so that&#39;s hard to screw up, would have preferred poppy seed so I won&#39;t knock them for that. The Italian beef I ordered was flavorful, the giardeneria (sp?) spicy, but there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of meat in the sandwich.

I wish they could keep it as simple as Gene and Jude&#39;s. Menu is too cluttered and makes the customer think forever of what they want at this establishment. Take away chicago style or regular style. The reason I say this is because if you ask for it chicago style, they will put the fries in a separate bag and not on top of the hotdogs. Regular double dog style with fries on it--Perfect. 
Make the prices a little more affordable. 2 orders of Double Dogs with fries at Gene and Judes comes out to 6.20 exactly. Just Hot Dogs- Total comes out to 8 dollars and 40 some cents. Also when they are preparing the hotdogs with the fries on top. They are not consistent with pairing the right amount of fries on top of your double dog.
If you want a good hot dog place to chill and eat with buddies, jump over to Just Hotdogs.
If you want the perfect Hotdog. Take the drive to Gene and Judes. It is worth the drive and is a lot cheaper and their portions are way more consistent than Just Hotdogs"

Their dogs are Chicago Red Hots (not Vienna Beef). Never had the burgers; seems like an odd thing to order at a place like this.

The cheese fries are an institution, despite not being &#39;fresh-cut&#39; or having &#39;real&#39; cheese. They use the nacho cheese dispenser. But really, &#39;real&#39; cheese (e.g., cheddar) for cheese fries is never really as rewarding as you expect it to be. The places doing it that way are always disappointing, in my opinion.

When we came for dinner, the place was packed but that didn&#39;t stop patrons from waiting.

We got our table 20 minutes in and my expectation went up after all the hype that came with a long wait. &#34;The food&#39;d better be bangin&#39;!&#34;

We got a combo with a bit of everything (except snow crab and lobster) so we ended up having a lot of shrimp. Our server suggested both butter and Cajun for sauce. 

We put on our bibs, washed our hands and let the feastin&#39; begin! 

The food was served in a bag where you could toss it around in to douse it in all the flavor. We went for mild and asked for extra chili on the side. The crustaceans were fresh and the taste was spot on. The suggested sauce mixture complemented the protein perfectly. 

I got lost in the delectable experience and didn&#39;t utter many words at the table until my last piece of shrimp made its departure from the bag. 

The food was fresh, tasty, perfectly cooked, and eating with your hands was exceptionally fun despite the pile of napkins and the mess we made. 

A+ for food and the experience!"

Well today must be my lucky day because I bought two pounds, but why didn&#39;t she say anything? When I asked oh that&#39;s dine in only, I said ok.

Crazy crab did not disappoint.  I split the crazy pot for $40 with a friend.  I also checked in on yelp to get 1 pound of crawfish for free.

Do the mix of all three flavors.  If you like spicy then get the insane level.  The insane level was spicy but not too spicy where you can&#39;t enjoy it.

Also tried the fried oysters which were okay but I probably wouldn&#39;t order them next time.  Cajun fries were also good."

The combo of 3 sauces, the fresh and perfectly steamed shell fish...you can&#39;t help but want to lick your fingers and since this is the best (&amp; most likely only) way to eat this delectable seafood...you&#39;ll be licking yours too.

First things first.  Whatever seafood you choose, go the 3 way on sauce.  Don&#39;t settle for one, makes a huge difference and packs way more flavor.

Ordered 1lb each: Deveined headless shrimp, mussels and clams drenched in 3 way sauce: (highly recommend) Crazy Cajun, Lemon pepper &amp; Garlic butter.  Its a symphony of flavors. I chose med heat and probably could&#39;ve  went &#39;crazier&#39;...spicy but not overbearing.

Everything was fresh and cooked perfectly. Nothing was over cooked or dry.  Shrimp was delicious. Mussels were meaty - my two favorites and I&#39;d totally order this again. Clams were little neck and not as impressive as mussels but still good. Fried oysters were too heavily floured for me.  I like to taste more oyster and less breading, otherwise oysters were fresh and also meaty. Cajun onion rings had a nice spice and mild kick.  I could taste paprika, cayenne and cumin.  

Garlic noodles were no biggie and a pass next time.  Not flavorful.  Just noodles with oil/butter and some garlic. It needed more sauce, spice.  I don&#39;t know if they use their garlic butter sauce on this, but these noodles would be SO much better if they used all three sauces...huge difference in taste going the 3 way...have I mentioned 3 way?

We took our order to go and they did a phenomenal job wrapping up our seafood. Double bagged in plastic, tied and placed in container.  I purposely let this sit for a bit before diving in so our seafood could soak up more of the yummy juices. Interior is newer, clean and casual.  Server was super friendly.  

I&#39;m telling you, I could dip bread in this stuff, or add pasta to it .  I&#39;ll admit it is a little oily, but what do you expect? The oil didn&#39;t overpower all the other great flavors.  If you&#39;re sharing, 1 lb is enough for two or 3 to sample while trying other seafood.  They don&#39;t do 1/2 lbs fyi.

Our order was around $65.  No it isn&#39;t cheap, but the quality is present and they get their fish locally as well as from New Orleans.  Personally, I think its worth it and they have a great seafood selection - some of which is not listed on their website / menu.
Crazy pots filled with shrimp, crawfish, mussels, clams, Alaskan snow crabs, corn, potatoes, and sausage.

They have new offerings and specials, check out their Facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/search/980522441982912/local_search?surface=tyah

If you like them on Facebook currently they are offering a free lb of crawfish. They also had  fresh oysters for a limited time &amp; dammit I missed it!"

We ordered Crawfish and the headless deveined shrimp by the pound, with all three seasonings mixed together, (Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic Butter) at the &#34;Calm&#34; spice level. The crawfish bag was a little saltier than the shrimp bag, but equally as tasty. It was all cooked perfectly and We can&#39;t wait to go again!!!

We also ordered the Cajun Fries, which are big enough to share between two people with big appetites, but they ended up actually being steak fries with some Cajun seasoning sprinkled on. (I don&#39;t want to compare, but we had previously eaten at the Angry Crab in the city and they have thinner Cajun fries, so we weren&#39;t expecting steak fries, but they were still yummy!) They were $4.50 I believe, which is in line with other similar places.

My husband ordered the beignets and they come as a 4 piece covered with powdered sugar. He said they weren&#39;t exactly authentic tasting, but they sure were delicious. He said he&#39;d order them again next time.

They have other add-ons like corn, sausage, potatoes, and rice, which are inexpensive.

One unique side item we noticed was Garlic noodles, which seem to be very popular, but I&#39;m allergic to wheat, so I of course wasn&#39;t able to try them. (Maybe I can suggest a Gluten-Free version for those of us who suffer with Celiac Disease and Wheat allergies.)

They also have calamari, which is popular. Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, regular fries, fried seafood baskets, other food items, bottled beer, and soft drinks.

Overall, this place was quite the surprise because the food was excellent, not to mention, the service was actually the BEST SERVICE we&#39;ve EVER had after 2.5 years of living in the Chicago area. We brought our 6 month old baby and we had a great time. Mike was our server, and he anticipated our every move &amp; brought the things we needed without even having to ask us. It was like he read our minds and knew what we needed before we even realized it ourselves! Impeccable service! Mike gave us great recommendations, taught us how to eat crawfish successfully, and gave excellent follow up service. Thank you Mike!!! We will be back and we hope you&#39;ll be our server again next time!"

My friend and I came here for dinner and ordered the special (it&#39;s not on the menu). It&#39;s not a fancy place - don&#39;t wear nice clothes, fine jewelry, slap a bib on and dig in. They even have a hand washing station, because you are gonna get dirty! That&#39;s what I like.

They sell the seafood by the half pound - everything from whole lobster, crab legs, head on shrimp, head off shrimp, mussels, clams, and crayfish. You can customize your dish the way you like it with the spices, sauces, and hotness (as in spicy). The food comes out relatively quickly, and it&#39;s to die for! So good. The spice is just right. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Crayfish is now my new favorite thing thanks to this place!

They don&#39;t have an amazing drink menu, some bottled beers, but that&#39;s about all you need. or the quality and amount of food, the prices aren&#39;t bad. I loved it!"

I ordered one each of the corn, potato and sausage. The sausage didn&#39;t arrive in my bag, I had to remind our server I ordered it (but he brought me 2 for the wait). The potato was so well done, it  just fell apart in pieces. Loved the lemon butter and the Cajun we ordered medium, but was more like mild. The price for Devine shrimp was the same as headless so why not make it easier on yourself. 

Really like the 4 handwashing stations with plenty of soap and towels since the bathrooms are single person rooms. Makes it nice that you don&#39;t have to wait to wash your hands. We will definitely be back but early in the evening. Went around 5:30 on a Wednesday and no wait for a table. Don&#39;t wear anything you wouldn&#39;t want to risk getting food stains on!

In the Midwest, it was difficult to find something comparable to Hot &amp; Juicy and every one place we tried, we always compared the flavors to it. My husband and I have gone to Angry Crab, Boiling Crab, Low Country&#39;s, and Asian Cajun. Out of all the places, I&#39;d say this was in my bottom 2. 

Service was great and it was nice to get a free lb of crawfish when checking into Yelp, but I will not be returning here as flavors were not in my best interest. It was very oily and the insane spice level wasn&#39;t even spicy, at least to us. 

I will give it to them regarding the fried oysters as they even hooked it up with more than usual. It&#39;s just unfortunate everything else we looked for comparing flavors to hot &amp; Juicy was lacked."

The service is as good as it gets. Probably the best that I&#39;ve experienced from Angry Crab, Low Country,  Asian Cajun, and The Boiler. Everyone checks on you regularly and they even put your bib on which caught me by surprise because I was not expecting that haha. 

We ordered 1 lb of whole shrimp with All 3 sauces and getting crazy (spice level). The spice level was perfect and not too buttery compared to the other seafood boil places. I was surprised that they&#39;ve an option of headless deveined shrimp. That was something new that I&#39;ve never seen offered. We also got a deal which is 2-3 lbs worth of seafood for $40. It included whole shrimp, crawfish, mussels, calms, snow crab legs, 2 potatoes, 2 corns, and 2 sausage. GREAT DEAL! We couldn&#39;t finish it! 

I&#39;m upset that I haven&#39;t tried any of the sides when I came in. The garlic noodles are a crowd favorite that I&#39;ve heard from the server. I hear that they&#39;re also coming up with different sides which is awesome. I&#39;m pretty big with seafood boil places so I&#39;m still trying to find one with great  service, great spice/seasoning level, and great sides. Right now, Crazy crab owns the service and spice/seasoning level. 

I would def come back here again and it&#39;s SOO close! Awesome place with a great staff! The only thing that I would suggest is having paper towels already at the table. At Crazy Crab, you have to ask for the paper towels."

We normally go to Angry Crab (Chicago) or Hot N Juicy (Las Vegas) for this type of food but once we heard about this place we wanted to try it out. 

I honestly can say I like this place better than Angry Crab. I tried the headless and devained shrimp with the cajun and garlic butter flavoring at the &#34;I luv crazy&#34; spice level. I normally don&#39;t eat too spicy but this was great! 

Service was alright. There was not really much of an explanation of how the menu worked so we didn&#39;t know we could mix all three flavors together when we first ordered. Took a bit to get all things settled and make sure we had everything because we constantly had to keep asking for more after our waiter walked away. At one point, we didn&#39;t want to bother anymore because we wanted to enjoy our food more than being clean. (Asking for a bib or gloves)

Music selection was phenomenal. I must say the overall environment was great."

My family and I were very pleased with our meal here from start to finish. If I had to make a minor complaint, it would be that I wish they had mallets for the crabs, and they were out of Blue crabs that day, but those are very minor!

All together we had:
2 pounds of snow crab
1 pound of mussels
1 pound of clams
1 pound of deveined, headless shrimp
1 pound of crawfish(free with your Yelp check in!)
1 order of beignets


................so basically everything! I found the sauces weren&#39;t as spicy as some of the other seafood streamer restaurants I&#39;d been to lately, so I would probably go up a level to the &#39;I luv crazy&#39; next time. We tried the mix of all 3 sauces on everything, and it was delicious! To top it all off, you&#39;ve got to try the beignets! Very traditional NOLA style doughnuts that are topped with the perfect amount of powdered sugar!

Overall our meal came to *just* under $100. Is that real life? We were shocked, less than $100 for 6 pounds of seafood AND dessert? DEFINITELY coming back!"

Just driving by, you might have hesitation. Looks like a hole in the wall seafood place. Usually spells disaster. But you are surprised right when you walk inside. The decor is coastal and laid back. You can write on pretty much anything. Could get sloppy but nice for the kids to run around with a marker on the walls. But the place is clean. Very well kept. The wait staff was friendly. The service was fast. When you first see everything come out in a clear industrial garbage bag, you try to make sense of it at first. But then when you dive in, you understand it. All the flavors, all the goodness is at the bottom. I ordered the snow crab with garlic butter. It was messy, but delicious. U can unshell all your crab and let it soak in the butter garlic at the bottom. Sooooooo good. 

I would compare this place to a Joe&#39;s Crab Shack (though it is better than Joe&#39;s) or bubba bumps. Not like a bob Chins. The prices are reasonable for seafood. Definitely not over priced. But be prepared to spend at least 50 bucks between two people. 

I will be back."

For those of you familiar, this place is like Boiling Crab from the LA area.

You order food by the pound and they boil it in stock of sorts that adds great flavor then they put it in a bag and give it to you.  You leave the shells on the table and make a mess of your hands as you eat. If you like seafood and don&#39;t mind getting messy, go for it.

Sauce choices: Cajun, Lemon, Garlic (non are spicy by default you choose that in the second step of ordering).

Spiciness: Choose from the equivalents of Mild, Medium, Spicy, Extra Spicy. We went with the medium and you got some spiciness without overwhelming the flavor. If you like spicy food go spicy or extra.

Calamari - tender rings of calamari in a batter that is similar to onion rings.  They taste good but even better if you dip it into the sauce.

Clams - great explosions of flavor with tender clams.  The best part is you can scoop up the garlic pieces and cajun spices as you eat which makes it great tasting.

Crawfish - I hate working for my food but I had fun trying to figure this one out.  Here&#39;s what I figured out, hold the head in one hand and the body in the other, twist about 30 degrees away from you. Then pull down gently and the meat should pop out of the head.  Then hold the body and tail the same way you just had it and push down on both sides of the body to snap the shell across the &#34;spine&#34; if it had one.  Then pull up from the bottom of the body and the shell should come off and you get a piece of meat about an inch or so long.  Dip the meat into the juices since most of the flavor is in the juices.

Sausage - Polish sausage - it&#39;s fine, honestly you can get it anywhere so no real need to order it here

fyi they were still doing the grand opening special, check in on facebook and you get a free lb of craw fish.  Just ask if they are still running it when you go in.

There is a nice hand washing station outside the bathrooms with 4 sinks so you can get cleaned up without having to wait.  Very nice touch!"

Reminds me of seafood places from the south coasts. There&#39;s writing all over the walls and they play &#34;hip&#34; music. Wasn&#39;t a fan of 3 drake songs in a row, though. They switched it up to some Marley and slightly stupid, ya mon! Cool crab bibs too, haha! Hand washing stations outside of the bathroom with bucket sinks to boot!

It&#39;s a smaller, newer place... the service was quick and friendly. Very casual, laid back and chill vibes here. Servers wearing t-shirts and board shorts/short shorts. Everything is served and eaten with disposable products.

The seafood is pretty fresh... Fried cod was good with the Cajun fries, just over priced, IMHO. Can&#39;t go wrong with three seasonings together: garlic butter, lemon pepper and Cajun! Bomb.com, fo-sho. If you&#39;re into spicy flavors, ask for the insane seasoning on the side. It&#39;s Cayenne pepper powder and dip as you please. 

Sweet, cool little spot for the area. Would definitely go back after a while, not good enough to go regularly, IMHO. Please, love and fish grease."

Ordered Beignets (French pronounced, Ben -Yeah) which is a fried pastry dough. They were a little doughy inside, but not too bad. Also ordered Cajun chicken wings, which they were out of and Cajun shrimp, The shrimp with their sauce were outstanding. Best shrimp I have ever had. Minimum order is 1lbs of seafood, so I split the shrimp with my wife.

Very friendly greeter and waiter service."

The crab legs with the garlic butter was outstanding, large legs and super fresh. The meat came out clean and whole, great sign of freshness and perfectly cooked. The mussels were great too.

I&#39;ve been to Angry Crab, lowcountry, and the Rim Seafood in Chicago and the Boiling Crab in Las Vegas so I wanted to see if this place was comparable to the competitors in Chicago. Plus my friends on Facebook said it was &#34;good as Angry Crab&#34; so I wanted to see for myself if this was true.

Location- this place is in a small strip mall, there&#39;s plenty of parking available in the lot. The place is spacious on the inside and not cramped like it is at Angry Crab. The layout is pretty much the same, with a sink to wash your hands in the back of the restaurant and the walls filled with names of visitors that had checked out the restaurant  (we didn&#39;t get a marker by the way.)

Food- the food was plain to say the least. I ordered 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of clams, with Calm spice (not spicy) and garlic butter. My boyfriend got a 1 lb each of shrimp, clams, and crawfish with &#34;I Luv Crazy&#34; spice and the 3 flavors combined (cajun, lemon, and garlic butter). My order was inconsistent. My bag of clams was spicier than my bag of shrimp, when I requested not spicy for both my shrimp and clams. I hated the sauce, it was super runny, watery, and thin, leaving none of the sauce on the seafood. Usually, I like the sauce thick like how it is at Angry Crab and lowcountry so it clings on to the seafood. But here, it was super runny so none of the flavor stayed on and it tasted plain. Also, the garlic butter sauce was too garlicky and I couldn&#39;t taste the butter. It tasted like garlic water sauce, so disappointing. My boyfriend said his crawfish was overcooked, making it hard for him to peel and it looked mushy. He ordered the &#34;I Luv Crazy&#34; spice, which wasn&#39;t spicy at all for him. We also ordered the Fried Oysters with French Fries. This was not good and I don&#39;t recommend ordering it. It was just super greasy oysters that tasted fishy and the fries had no salt so it was just fried potatoes.

Service- our server was friendly at first and explained the menu nicely since it was our first time there. However, as time went on, he never once asked how we were doing and how our food was. Our food didn&#39;t take too long (15 to 20 minutes) but I didn&#39;t like how they brought out our seafood in a bag separately. Considering my boyfriend and I bought 5 lbs of food, they came to our table at 5 different times, which was inconvenient. I&#39;d rather have our food come out at the same time, rather than 5 times. I had also ordered the Fried Oysters with fries as an appetizer and I thought it was weird that our main course came out before our appetizer did. 30 to 40 minutes pass and our server still did not ask how we were doing nor did he refill our water. I thought he was the only server and there were about 5 or 6 other tables so I felt bad at first until I saw another woman who started to serve the other tables. It wasn&#39;t until he went to the table next to us and starting cleaning the table, that I grabbed his attention and asked about our appetizer. At this point, I already knew he forgot since we were 75% done eating and almost 40 minutes passed by. He kept apologizing and he felt bad, he gave us the appetizer for free for forgetting to place that order. I commend him for doing that for us but I wish the other staff (I saw like 4 busboys and he was the only waiter until we were almost done eating) would be more attentive and help him out, instead of standing in the back, waiting to do something.

Verdict- food was plain and the staff needs to work on professionalism and customer service. Sorry, Crazy Crab but I&#39;m not crazy about your food and service. I&#39;ll stick to the competitors in Chicago."
crazy-crab-streamwood,Elaine M.,2YKO5OxTfgW-qDKZaWwD1w,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,75,48,a-POMpgh6TsQOxj3ZUA9Ag,5.0,2016-05-31,"We finally got to try Crazy Crab in Streamwood. Having been to The Boiler in Skokie and Angry Crab in Chicago, my family knew how to order and what to expect.  A few members of our party had never experienced the shellfish-in-a-bag restaurant experience, so our server did a great job explaining the process.  

We ordered cajun chicken wings (very salty), the fried fish basket (fried cod with french fries), cajun shrimp, garlic butter shrimp (my favorite!), mussels, onion rings, fries, rice, and drinks.  The food came out quickly and almost too hot to touch with your fingers.  Fortunately (unlike their competition), Crazy Crab offers paper &#34;plates&#34; and plastic forks.  Also, 4 sinks outside the washroom for washing the spices and butter off your fingers.  (I believe The Boiler only has 1 and Angry Crab just 2 dining room sinks.)

Overall, the Crazy Crab sauces we ordered were excellent, all the seafood was very fresh and perfectly cooked, and the staff was friendly.  I love the fact that they offer shrimp 3 ways:  head on, headless, and headless/deveined.  The headless/deveined shrimp is so easy to peel!

We were a party of 8, but got 3 separate checks.  The server was very nice about this and got everything correct (sounds odd to mention, but often the drinks and appetizers get put on the wrong checks).  He did pre-add an 18% tip for each ticket (because the total party was over 6 people?), which we paid without complaint.  We were planning to tip 20%, so that&#39;s his loss.

There&#39;s plenty of free parking and this location is convenient for my extended family.  We are looking forward to our next visit to Crazy Crab!"

I&#39;m never going to a chain seafood place again. Great menu, unlike other places you can order A la carte and the market prices are clearly stated. The atmosphere is fun, you can draw on the walls and dump your seafood on the table. I had a beautiful Dungeness crab, it was this monster that meaty and yummy. We also go crawfish and sweat potato fries. We got a good tip on Yelp that you can mix the sauces that go on your boil.  I sang praises with every bite. I used to live on the cost and I miss the seafood so much. This place tasted like home.  The service was good too! Our drink was always full and even cups to go.

Sets the whole mood for me for the actual meal and this place has the WORST SERVICE I have ever seen. We walk in and there&#39;s a guy at the front counter (short buzzed haircut) doing something and doesn&#39;t greet us, or say &#34;We&#39;ll be right with you&#34; - doesn&#39;t even LOOK at us, and I swear a whole minute and a half passes and I&#39;m starting to get pissed. We just stood there. I was about to just seat myself but a lady finally comes up and seats us. 

We eat our food - not bad, but not the best boil we&#39;ve had. Price seems fair and the shrimp looked fresh.

After we were done, it took us another while to get our check. Someone brings us our check, and walks away. I was tired of WAITING so I told my husband, &#34;let&#39;s just pay up front.&#34; 

We go up to the counter and its the SAME GUY who pissed me off at the beginning - I hand him our check and ask if we can pay there at the front desk. He says, &#34;oh sure, I can do that for you.&#34; As he is ringing us up, he says, &#34;But next time, make sure you pay at the table, okay?&#34; 

That did it for me. I just looked at him and said as bluntly as I could, &#34;Yeah, well, we&#39;ve BEEN waiting at the table.&#34; Then his look softens and says, &#34;oh, really? Ok.&#34; No apologies, no nothing.

Yeah, it doesn&#39;t take a genius to be able to have some common sense when it comes to customer service. You don&#39;t greet the customer, make them stand awkwardly in front of you for too long without a word, and then tell them, &#34;Just make sure you pay at the table next time.&#34; No &#34;please.&#34; If that was my employee, I&#39;d fire him. 

Food aside - the service is what keeps a customer coming back. And we won&#39;t be. Angry Crab has better service and just as good food."

This is a fun place where you order a pound of shellfish and they bring it to you in a clear plastic bag with no plates or silverware. You dig in with your hands and let the cajun juices from the shellfish and sauce drip down your hands. You leave the shells right on the table. it was quite a fun experience. Don&#39;t wear anything nice!

I liked the set-up of this place with wooden tables and benches which were set up pretty close to each other. It was nice chatting with the table next to us or being able to see what other tables were ordering. There were a few long tables set up for large groups. I would definitely recommend coming with a group of 4 or more so that you can try all the different shellfish they have. The server suggested 1 pound for 2 people which is the minimum they serve.  If you go with one other person, you can definitely order 2 pounds but you&#39;ll definitely walk away really full.

We had the crawfish ($8/lb) and clams ($10/lb) in the cajun medium spicy. Definitely recommend the clams! There is a lot of garlic and bold spices in the sauce so if you have indigestion or heartburn, make sure you load up on your antacids before and after! The fried calamari ($8) was awesome. I would go back just for the calamari."

Crazy Crab is located in a small &amp; to me kind of a random strip mall. It&#39;s smaller than the other Cajun places. Nice, clean, and spacious. 

We arrived on a Saturday night &amp; we waited 20 minutes or so for a table. Not too bad. But, I&#39;m expecting it to be much busier once more people find out about it. 

Their Cajun sauce is really good. I can taste all the elements in their sauce in each bite. The spice, the garlic, the butter. I got the &#39;I luv crazy&#39; which is the third spice level. I didn&#39;t find it very spicy, but I like spicy food.

The crawfish is only $8!! The rest of the seafood prices are comparable to the other Cajun restaurants. 

Service is pretty much the same as all the other places. We didn&#39;t have trouble grabbing help if we needed them and they came by to check on us asked for refills on our waters/beers. They don&#39;t have the salt, pepper, &amp; lime concoction that others have, but you can ask them for the ingredients you just need to make it yourself. They also provided me with gloves which I liked.

I&#39;ll be back to try all the other items on the menu."

Why didn&#39;t this place get the  other stars? Because they lack decent sides and variety in their menu and the location is again, hideous!

I appreciate the combination of all 3 flavors (Cajun, garlic butter, and lemon pepper) making the perfect Cajun seasoning of the broiled crustaceans . I also appreciate their handwash station nearby the actual tables. Bonus! 

However, their appys are subpar and nothing complimentary to their entrees IMO. Definitely skip the beignets and seasoned fries. Waste of money and tummy space. Bleh!

They&#39;re priced comparably to other Cajun seafood joints and so far so clean! I hope it stays this way.

The restaurant was smaller than I expected and bright, really bright, like hospital cafeteria bright.  But, is was clean and the food was fresh.

If you like garlic, go for the garlic butter sauce, you will see mass amounts of minced garlic in the sauce.  The extra spicy sauce is excellent too.  Crayfish are not for everyone but if you like these little critters, Crazy Crab does an excellent job with them.  If you like shrimp, it&#39;s nice that you can get them whole with the head on, partially cleaned and deveined or if you are prissy like me, completely clean and ready to chow on.

We ordered the corn and loved it.  I thought .75 was reasonable for this add-on and it was infused with the garlic and hot sauce.  We went really early and there was no wait.

We had the snow crab with garlic and butter, but had to order two since it really is not enough. Also had the jumbo shrimp with all three sauces and probably should have ordered it like the crab with just the garlic and butter, but it was great too. The jumbo shrimp is where it&#39;s at! Lots of shrimp in the bag and worth the price. 

Adding the corn, potato and sausage for 75 cents is NOT worth it at all. Way too small for that price. Also, had the calamari and it was great too! Everything was fresh and tasted top notch, only gripe was the price on the add-ons. Highly recommended place to eat, just be prepared to pay seafood market prices.

Place was nice and ample places to wash your hands. There was a dedicated hand washing station towards the back.

Let me start by saying we went to Crazy Crab on a Sunday afternoon around 3:30pm. We were a fairly large group (9 people). Right after we walked in it was like the late lunch crowd got there because by the time we left it was PACKED with other large groups. I was happy to see a new restaurant with so much booming business. 

I love the fact that this new restaurant is different then your typical place in Schaumburg/The Arboretum in South Barrington. You can&#39;t usually find Cajun/Creole places in the burbs... You have to drive to a neighborhood of the city. I&#39;m so happy that this place is now in the burbs. 

I love the way you can customize your seafood selections. Some of us wanted our food a little spicy, and others did not, so we were able to customize our sauces and spices. 

5 of us split the following:
2 lbs of headless de-veined shrimp (these are monster size shrimp!!)
2 lbs of Alaskan crab legs
1 lb of mussels
1 lb of clams
2 lbs whole lobster

The five of us were definitely FULL when we were all done. Just a side note - When they say GARLIC BUTTER, they mean overloaded with GARLIC! We were all family, so we didn&#39;t care smelling like garlic, but I wouldn&#39;t go on a date there or anything your married and totally comfortable! You will leave smelling like garlicky goodness. 

I absolutely LOVE Crazy Crab. I&#39;m totally a fan and I&#39;ll definitely be back with my husband and other family members. This place is AWESOME for group dining and kid friendly. It&#39;s fun to share and eat with your hands and the ambiance is totally chill and very inviting. Our total bill for 9 people was about $270 before tip. We all walked about of there spending about $36 per person. I was pleasantly surprised considering how much amazing seafood we consumed. 

See you soon Crazy Crab!"

They refilled foam soap dispensers with regular thick liquid soap so nothing would come out of the dispenser. How were the employees washing their hands???!!! Prices were slightly more than what you would expect at Joe&#39;s or red lobster but no options for salad or anything other than eating with your bare hands. Cheaper than Shaws or Bob Chinn, but it&#39;s a local dive not a nice restaurant, so it should be.

It wasn&#39;t too busy, only three or four diners.    Like other reviewers, our wait person simply left the menus on the table and walked away.  No explanation.  Plus, the only way we got service was to call out in a loud voice &#34;Hey, can we get some plastic knives and a couple more napkins&#34;.  Bang! We got service--being loud pays off.  

We were taken aback by the crawfish prep.  Having been to many seafood joints in Louisiana and Texas, we were used to steamed crawfish.  But, what the heck, we&#39;re open to new ideas.

The crawfish were fresh and priced right.   After polishing off the crawfish, we were left with a bag of tasty sauce.  Sure wish we had some crusty French bread for dipping.  I would have paid for the bread.  It could be listed under the &#34;Add-on Items&#34;.  

And, speaking of &#34;Add-on Items&#34;, we were taken aback by the skimpy potato and sausage.  Charge a little more and give a better portion."

I consider it more Schaumburg than Streamwood.   The menu is simple you either buy your seafood by the pound or under the &#34;starters&#34; column you can get  fried fish basket w/french fries and that applies to the chicken tenders, fried shrimp or fried oyster basket.  My husband ordered the fried shrimp basket with french fries, I chose 1lb of clams in garlic butter with the spicy level of calm (least spicy).  I also ordered under add -on items corn on the cob.  Other family members ordered the headless devein shrimp in crazy cajun/lemon butter with the &#34;I luv Crazy&#34; spicy level.  The food came out quite fast and in a plastic bag if  you were ordering seafood by the pound.  
I have to say I loved the small clams it was delicious - BTW - the server suggested that if you check in on their facebook page they are offering a pound of crawfish with your meal for free!  
Since this is new, the restaurant is nicely done, with a hand washing station in the back of the restaurant (nice idea).  The lighting is perfect I don&#39;t like eating in a dimly lit restaurant this place was bright and had a few tvs mounted on the walls for people like my husband who didn&#39;t want to miss the sports going on. 
We&#39;ll be back the prices are definitely reasonable and the quality of fresh seafood was superb. I think as they get into the swing of this type of restaurant they will tweak their menu to the preference of their customers - how about a la carte...fried oysters no french fries?   Great job!!  the servers were friendly and attentive."

Short on time we ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crabs with the mix of all 3 sauces at the getting crazy spice level. We also ordered a pound of mussels with Cajun and spicy. The seafood quality was fine but the sauce was very bland and it was all butter.  Even dipping every piece all you could taste was bitter garlic and butter.  We ended up having to add our own chili powder to the sauce. We&#39;ll give it another go hoping we had a bad batch but if it&#39;s the same stuff as last we are better off buying our own seafood from Costco and melting our own butter with creole seasoning.

It seemed chaotic and did not have things under control with checking everyone in. Luckily we asked when we were up next, because they crossed our names off before even seating us. The front of house didn&#39;t seem as friendly as when we sat down. The guy who seemed like the manager of or owner was very nice and attentive other than towards the end when we had to flag someone down to get the check and to pay our bill. 

Overall the food itself was good and is comparable to other crab boils in the area. The sauces weren&#39;t as mixed throughout the whole bag. 

Hopefully they fix their tweaks in the front of the house or at least have friendlier people helping customers as soon as we walk in and more organized with checking in."

1. The seafood should not be greasy. 
2. Overpriced sides: 75 cents each for unseasoned 1/4 of a red potato and an inch long piece of crappy (non-Cajun) sausage. 2b. Just include one of each: potato (whole), corn (whole), sausage (whole) in with the seafood....and charge about $1.50. 
3. Poor and messy presentation: paper cartons for crab legs???? 
4. &#34;Cajun&#34; = Not at all. Not bad flavor, just too greasy and not Cajun by a long shot. 
5. Seasoning should be in the water, not post-boiling. 5b. Sides should be cooked WITH the seafood.
6. Beignets weren&#39;t bad but too small. 
7. Sinks for customers to use is genius. 
8. Decor is just a weird hodge-podge of mismatched beach trinkets that have zero to do with cajun cuisine or culture. 
9. Training is needed across the board - from the hostesses, servers to the managers - as well as fixing the cuisine. Some were polite but highly disorganized."

The sweet potato fries were bland (bad choice on my part should&#39;ve gone with the boiled potato instead). White rice is white rice. The chicken tenders are worth skipping (once again my fault, don&#39;t order chicken at a crab joint). The bill was a little much. Their market prices are a little high for my taste. Overall, I came for the crab and it exceeded my expectations. The 4 stars are for everything else, but don&#39;t skip out because their seafood delivers on every level. Also, parking is free and abundant. They also include the tip on your check when you pay with your card which is a little presumptuous since they don&#39;t give you an option to not tip if you prefer to leave a cash tip instead which I often prefer, but it&#39;s no biggie."

The restaurant was not too noisy and what you expect from a restaurant that does boils.

We ordered a pound of shrimp, pound of Crawfish and pound of Alaskan King Crab legs.  The food was delicious, especially with 3 flavors all mixed together.  We had the insane heat which I consider mild but other thought was nice and hot.  Had the crab legs in the butter and garlic and delicious.  Everything was cooked to perfection and the crawfish tasted fresh.

Only reason why this is not 5 star instead of 4 star, is that they do not have french bread to soakk up the sauce when done.  This is a must if you claim to be a Cajun/Creole restaurant.  Pair with a local bakery and get it done.

And also, throw in some Abita beer on the menu :)

This is not a negative to me, but they do not have a liquor license, so prepare accordingly for beer.

Will return when back in the Schaumburg area."

Food was excellent, service as excellent.  we had no idea how it worked.  it is a simple menu, with a 1,2,3,4 process.  pick your seafood, all are market price and by the lb.  then your sauce, all in garlic butter, bit can add lemon pepper and Cajun.  next, pick how spicy you want to go and if you want to add any sausage, potatoes, or corn.  it all comes in a clear plastic bag, it is extremely fresh and hot.  it is messy, so be aware of what you wear.  I only saw shellfish choices on the menu, but they did have chicken fingers as a appetizer.  I would definitely go back."

The waitress lost one of the table tickets for the order we ended up waiting 45 min for our food. They kept coming with orders not knowing who they belonged to. No customer service skills, starting from the manager , to the rest of the staff, they are young with no experience, and  very rude. They demand to pay the 18% for tip regardless on how many people sit on the table. We asked for the owner and one of the staff members said it was he, later on in the night we found out she wasn&#39;t the owner she lied to us. They don&#39;t accept reservations and the wait to seat down is ridiculous. They stared at us up &amp; down and kept making unfriendly faces because we had a large party of people.

I am happy to say that Ann, one of Fiora&#39;s owners, contacted me immediately upon seeing my review on Yelp and Facebook, in an effort to make things right.

Ann is a lovely business woman who was quite distressed by the behavior of her manager. She apologized profusely saying she assured me that this behavior &#34;would never happen again.&#34; She and her husband do not tolerate such rude behavior from their employees. Because of this, she has invited us back for another whirl, their treat. 

Because of her professionalism and prompt attention to our problem I am happy to say that we will take her up on her invitation and enjoy another night of great service and excellent food.

I anticipate a much happier ending than our previous experience.

Thanks Ann!"

Fiora&#39;s had live music outside which sounded delightful. To no surprise there was over an hour wait for their patio tables, so we opted just to eat inside right away instead (you could say we were pretty hungry).

We were sat at a quiet table near the sunroom at the back of the restaurant. Our waitress was super sweet, but we kind of felt like she was rushing us the whole time. We each had a cocktail, soup, and our entree and were literally in and out in 45 minutes. For a date night that cost us $100 we were hoping for a longer more relaxing evening.

That being said, our food was very good. The watermelon lemon mocktail I had was summery and refreshing. It was the perfect treat for a celebratory toast with my hubby for our 3 year wedding anniversary. The lobster bisque was yummy as well. The cup was a bit pricey for the size, but I can&#39;t say I was surprised. The bread and cracker assortment that came with our meal was a nice touch.

For my main entree I had their chicken medallion with spinach and angel hair pasta. It was the perfect amount of food and everything was delicious. The chicken melted in my mouth and the pasta and veggies complimented each other very well.

I&#39;d definitely like to come back for some wine on their patio and maybe even tap into their lunch menu (since it&#39;s cheaper!). Overall a tasty spot with a nice atmosphere. It&#39;s to be mentioned that their menu is American -- not Italian which is what we originally expected ;)"

I was getting hungry, seeing as it was 8 PM and I&#39;d traveled in from the city for my appointment, so we stopped in to split a meal. 

The hostess helped entice us in by letting us know that their deal of the evening was half off cocktails, so we were sold off the bat. This is a beautiful old home converted into a restaurant with a gorgeous patio, outdoor bar, and 4 seasons porch for chillier months. If I could eat here every night (and maybe even live here...?), I absolutely would. 

First ordered the prosecco with pomegranate juice...MAN it was delicious!! So good that I will be replicating that drink on my wedding day while I get ready. Perfect proportions. Momma and I shared the burger and the watermelon salad. They knew we were splitting the meal, so they split it onto two different plates before they sent it out to us (I love when places do that). 

The burger is messssssy but it is very tasty! Perhaps I&#39;ll order it without mayo next time. The fries are my favorite kind - thick, crunchy outside and soft in the middle. The watermelon salad could have stood to have a bit more greenery and mozzarella, but maybe that&#39;s just my personal preference. It was still delicious!

Service is attentive, quick, and friendly, too. I asked to go to the bathroom in the wine cellar, and the hostess walked me all the way there to show me where it is. I really hope to come back here sometime in the winter time because the indoor seating here looks just as amazing, if not better, than their outdoor seating. Everything about this place is perfect, and even though I live in the city and am from Naperville, I can see myself making the trip to Geneva more than once just to visit this place again."

We had a reservation and were placed in the wine cellar by the fireplace, but ended up getting sat first upstairs, then downstairs and away from the fireplace.  Then when we asked a server if we could move to the seats by the fireplace, someone else proceeded to tell us &#34;NOOO!&#34;  And then 5 minutes later that same person said that, yes, we could move, as that was actually reserved for us.

Food was good, as good as most restaurants, but much more expensive than similar quality/service level places.  Drinks were reasonably priced, and my wife&#39;s sangria was great.

My husband and I tried it when we moved to the area this past summer, I was about 10 months pregnant at the time and everything always seemed to taste pretty good! However I remember thinking that my meal of crab cakes was good but not fantastic given the restaurant&#39;s popularity.

This weekend we dined here with friends and again, this wasn&#39;t a meal memorable enough to make me return especially because of the price. I ordered scallops over a sweet potato, kale &amp; bacon hash. Food arrived cold, and the scallops were a little fishy tasting and didn&#39;t seem to be seasoned well. The hash was good but even the sweet potatoes were cooked oddly in my opinion - they seemed steamed and mushy when I believe a hash is pan seared and therefore should have left the potatoes caramelized and crispy.

Also, my second glass of wine arrived and definitely seemed like it had been poured from a bottle that had been open a little too long. The waitress immediately replaced it so no complaints on service. In fact, I hate to give three stars when the waitress was among the best we have ever had! She was kind and professional, yet also playful with our group, and never missed a beat.

I&#39;m really not sure if I will be back for dinner, but for a (fresh) glass of wine and their cheese course, definitely, especially since the restaurant is gorgeous and has a fabulous outdoor patio for the summer."

Our server, Nick, was very funny and charming that made my experience even better.

We decided to eat outside, as my parents knew the people doing the live entertainment, that night and we wanted a front row seat to enjoy it.  

The hostesses were attentive and friendly and seated us right away.  Patio seating is first come, first serve, no reservations.  Nick, our server, was also friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.

The atmosphere is very nice.  The restaurant looks like someone&#39;s country house and with the outdoor patio, it gives it a classy but relaxed feeling.  I did pop inside the restaurant when I needed to use the restroom.  It&#39;s gorgeous inside!  The only turn off was that there was a heavy fish smell throughout the restaurant.  Might explain my mom&#39;s opinion about her Shrimp Risotto.  She said it didn&#39;t taste totally cooked and had a fishy smell, but she isn&#39;t the type of person to complain.

The menu isn&#39;t extensive, as any restaurant that uses quality ingredients and chef created cuisine, but there is something for everyone.  I ordered the Fiora&#39;s Supreme of Chicken.  It was very good, I&#39;m just not sure about the $26 price on it.  Some of the entrees command that kind of price, but I&#39;m still on the fence about how chicken, spinach and mashed potatoes comes up to $26.  Again though, it was good and I ate every bit of it.  I just expect that price for seafood or beef.

We all had a great time.  I love the ambiance, the service, the staff and the food.  If you ever hear that Dennis O&#39;Brien with John Paruolo is preforming, be sure to check them out.  Awesome live musicians!!

My wife and I have eaten here several times before and have always had impeccable service.  Ask for James or Leroy. They won&#39;t do you wrong! We had New Year&#39;s Eve reservations. Being New Years and a 2 hour time limit on seating we both did not expect too much. Boy, are we glad we were wrong! How a place that busy with that many orders coming in can turn food out that good and that well timed is impressive in itself.

They must have been full, as they sat us in the wine cellar. There were four tables in the room and a cozy fire in a fireplace to warm up the usually chilly room. Very nice touch!

We each had an appetizer and an entree. Each of us had to rate each item as a 5. We had a crab cake and the lobster bisque for our appetizers. OMG, the flavor and seasoning of each was perfect. The bisque was rich, creamy and loads of lobster. The bisque was so smooth and delightful, the only chunks were the generous portions of lobster in every bite. We both could have had that alone for dinner and been happy. The crab cake was another pleasant surprise. We kind of expected the standard over mayonnaisey (is that even a word) fried clump with your poor bottled type Bearnaise. Uh, NO! this too was perfectly seasoned, filled with tons of sweet crab and cooked perfectly. The Bearnaise was fresh, creamy, perfectly balanced with tarragon and acid. It was truly wonderful.

My wife ordered the salmon and I the scallops for our entrees. My wife can be a true snob when it comes to salmon, yet she continues to order it at many places, only to be disappointed, but always hoping for that once in a while surprise. Well, this evening was that surprise that made her extremely happy. Cooked to perfection, nicely seasoned and served over a bed of delightful couscous and asparagus. She was thoroughly impressed. I have been married to her for 23 years. I know how hard she is to impress. ;) The couscous and asparagus, both prepared with just the right amount of crunch and texture, really highlighted the salmon. Nice job!

My scallops were sweet, huge, nicely sauteed with a hint of crust on the outside and smooth and velvety throughout. This was served over a bed of sauteed kale with just the right amount of lemon and garlic as to highlight the sweetness of the scallops. Yep, again, perfect! I seem to be using that word a lot here.

Being the gluttons that we are, we went with a single lobster tail to split between us.. Cooked and seasoned to perfection with about the best side of seasoned clarified butter you could ever have, this just complimented our entrees even more. We sat there the entire time, ate each bite slowly and savored each taste. What a great evening.

There are very few restaurants, I find, that are actually good enough to not put anything other than silverware and napkins on the table. Well, tonight, Fiora&#39;s did themselves well. What a fantastic meal! 

We will be remembering this one for a long time. Thanx for the memorable evening."

Unusual spaces...private feel inside...looked like there was a nice atrium area for dining...and then a lovely patio.  It&#39;s great.  They even have a bar on the patio with its own section of high tables for drinks and appetizers.  If we&#39;d been there just for that I probably would have given three stars.  Live music outside...nice.

The problem is the food.  

My husband ordered what our server said they said they were &#34;famous&#34; for:  GRILLED SCALLOPS seasoned with salt and pepper and lightly grilled, served over a bed of heirloom black forbidden rice and sautéed Swiss chard and garnished with a saffron butter sauce.  For $27.95 you received four larger scallops and not much else.  Had those scallops been A-M-A-Z-I-N-G I think he would have been happy but they weren&#39;t.  It was disappointing enough for him to send back after just a few bites.

I ordered the BONELESS SHORT RIB slow cooked, glazed with Korean barbeque sauce, served over wasabi whipped potatoes and Asian vegetable slaw.  Spelling matters...it is indeed ONE medium-sized rib.  Also $27.95.  Um...  The reason I ordered this was because I had recently purchased some short ribs for my dog.  He was sick and nearing the end and I wanted to get him some really nice meaty bones like from a rib roast but the butcher recommended short ribs.  He cut them long for a good-sized bone.  I&#39;d never had short ribs before and was astonished by the amount of meat.  I roasted them for my pooch and omg...they looked good.  I just had to try.  They were like the most delicious prime rib.  Amazing.  Just something I roasted up for my dog...  And they were better than this expensive piece of meat.  This was more like a well-done piece of crock pot pot roast.  It wasn&#39;t bad but like the scallops, it wasn&#39;t at all amazing enough to justify the price.

Are you catching on about the portions too?  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m expecting an Old Country Buffet heap on my plate but c&#39;mon...ONE rib??

Another in our party had the SPANISH PAELLA chicken, shrimp, clams and sausage, pan cooked with saffron rice, roasted red peppers, tomatoes and peas for $26.95.  It looked nice on the plate and she said it was &#34;good.&#34;  There was more of a portion here but it&#39;s rice so...  Pricey pricey for what it was.  The final person had FIORA&#39;S SUPREME OF CHICKEN roasted with garlic, lemon and wine sauce, and served over whipped potatoes with wilted spinach and parmesan cheese for $25.95.  Also &#34;good.&#34;  

Almost forgot the appetizer:  THAI CALAMARI tender calamari fried and tossed in chili sweet sour sauce, topped with lime aioli, cilantro and scallions for $9.95.  It was tasty but smacked of being a shaken-out-of-a-freezer-bag and spruced up with a dollop of commercial spicy sauce and sprinkled with fresh greenery to make it look more special.  I wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised to be served this at TGI Fridays.

sigh...  Usually I&#39;m a sucker for a good patio and can forgive much under the spell of a perfect summer night but there was something so utterly lacking in this otherwise lovely place that had all four of us conclude that despite its charms, we wouldn&#39;t ever return.  That&#39;s too bad.

FYI:  They do take reservations but not for the patio."

The food was good but I had a problem with my appetizer I ordered the Brie Cheese. Now I am 46 years old and I know what Brie Cheese tastes like and this was not Brie Cheese it tasted like ricotta  . I called the waiter over and he insisted that it was Brie he even went back to the kitchen and brought out the container that the cheese came in to prove it to me. 

That ticked me off. and it ruined the rest of my dining experience there. I guess I was wrong about the Brie cheese cause he sure showed me."

As others have said the space is pretty cool.  Check out the various rooms on their website and request a preference if you have one.  There is a also a patio area with a bar of it&#39;s own that was putting out some live music when we were there.  The patio was packed with people that didn&#39;t appear to be overly drunk, but did appear to be having a pretty good time, making them well-behaved, somewhat-inebriated revelers, which works for me.
.

We ended up in a library like small room with only 3 tables in it.  As we were about halfway through a couple of drinks and a cheese plate (delicious) the other two tables left, leaving us in our own space.  We quickly figured out that we had easy control of the lighting via a dimmer switch directly next to us so we tuned our lighting and asked the waitress to fire up some candles, which she immediately did.

The cheese plate came with 3 cheeses, which you get to choose from a larger list of available cheeses, some fruits and others things to dress up your cheese bites, and some little bread thingies.  This was delicious.  I&#39;ve had a couple better, but only at Barrington Bistro which rocks the cheese platter world, with all other cheese platters kneeling before it; or Bin 36 which rolls out larger numbers of different cheeses per platter and paired wine flights, but this was quite good and it went a good way to filling us.  We didn&#39;t bother with other appetizers, salads, etc. and went right to entrees after drinks and cheeses, through which the waitress checked on us regularly to make sure we were in good shape.

My wife had some braised short rib concoction which was delicious and came with all sorts of flavors.  Although I only sampled a small bit, she liked it, I&#39;m sure of that.  I had the duck and loved it.  Again, it had a bunch of flavors.  A light, but not overpowering orange sauce, sitting on a bed of cous cous cooked perfectly and mixed with nuts, herbs and some bits of fruit that I think were mango or apricots.  It was delicious and we were both unable to finish.

I guess I&#39;m perplexed at some people complaining about portion sizes.  We couldn&#39;t have finished ours if we&#39;d been in an eating competition.  Between just the cheese platter and those entrees we walked off with enough for lunch the next day.

Ditto on pricing.  This is downtown Geneva, which, in case people haven&#39;t noticed, is a somewhat affluent area.  I think it&#39;s reasonable to assume that the location itself, being smack in the middle of Geneva is costing them a few dollars.  They&#39;re also going to have to add some bells and whistles if they hope to attract the denizens of this little burg of Rich Folks.   The people they&#39;re catering to expect to be catered to, and that&#39;s not cheap either.  

The prices are also on their online menu, so I just don&#39;t see how anyone can complain about that.

For 40-50 dollars a person you can walk out bursting at the seams.  You can of course spend more for multiple appetizers/courses, and alcohol will bump your bill up, but that is all at your discretion.

For that you&#39;re getting great atmosphere, really delicious food and plenty of it, and excellent service.  

It&#39;s not inexpensive, but it&#39;s fair.  We&#39;ll definitely be going back."

I can&#39;t say much about the price. I have a general idea but my chivalrous boyfriend never lets me see the bill :-)

The food wasn&#39;t BAD necessarily. And the prosecco served was quite good. I just expected better from its reputation. The calamari itself was good but over-sauced and ended up drowning in what tasted like your run of the mill sweet &amp; sour sauce. I&#39;m not too familiar with gazpacho but it tasted like I was eating pure salsa. My boyfriend&#39;s salmon was good, but my duck was just ok. And it was more rare than medium-rare. For dessert we tried the mousse and it was more like pudding. Maybe my hopes were too high, maybe I didn&#39;t properly research, but it wasn&#39;t something I&#39;d drive out to Geneva for again."

i love that they provide wine pairing recommendations with their menu.  i don&#39;t know anything about pairings so i thought that it was fun!  our waitress told us that they have a sommelier on staff.

I had the scallops which were absolutely incredible! just get them!!! My father-in-law got the spicy seafood pasta and really liked it. My mom and mother-in-law got the salmon and they seemed to enjoy it.  Husband and dad got the duck and they liked it... it seemed a bit fatty to me, but they didn&#39;t complain.

We had a few drinks and then were shown to a great table on the patio. Once at the table I grabbed another beer (nothing on tap, but a great bottle list) and we ordered the muscles. Delish! Expect to like a slight taste of black licorice, but still they were devine. We ordered a bottle of the pay dirt after that and a single serving on the cheese. The Gouda was so fantastic and fresh tasting! (Ask for a few extra crostini&#39;s!) the portion was huge! After that my girlfriend ordered the boneless short rib and I got the fish special. I substituted for the forbidden rice, which was excellent! She thoroughly enjoyed her shirt rib, and those wasabi mashed potatoes were incredible! We saved no room for desert, but were very pleased that we could get our wine corked to take with us, since we don&#39;t live in the area.

The best way I can describe the service is &#34;abrupt.&#34;  Our waters glasses were filled often, and dirty plates picked up right away, but our server was rather awkward, arriving at our table a half of a second after our food arrived with comments such as &#34;are you happy?&#34; or &#34;is it delicious?&#34; without our even having eaten anything.  I realize this doesn&#39;t appear to be too bad in writing, but in the moment it just felt incredibly strange.  Also, the food arrived very quickly.  Normally that wouldn&#39;t bother me, but when you order an appetizer or salad and it arrives within one minute, you have to wonder about the quality of preparation.

Speaking of the food, it wasn&#39;t bad, just not great.  We ordered calamari as an appetizer, which was adequate but I&#39;ve had better at other restaurants.  My husband ordered a wedge salad which should have been called &#34;blue cheese salad.&#34;  I&#39;ve never seen so much blue cheese before in my life; it just overpowered everything else.  My chicken supreme dish was warm, the chicken was juicy but overall quite bland.  And while the side of potatoes was quite good, the spinach was incredibly salty.

Again, I wanted to give it 3 stars, but it is more on the expensive side.  Everything is a la carte and there are minimal options for wine by the glass.  For those prices, I was hoping for a better dining experience than I received.  If we go back, we&#39;ll likely stick to the patio and keep to appetizers."

We had the crab cakes as our appetizer. They cost $12.95. They brought them out, and I was shocked when I saw only 2 small cakes on the plate. For $13 I expect more then 2 crab cakes! And they were a little over cooked. My girlfriend ordered the lobster bisque, which was fantastic, but a little pricey at $5 for a cup. She then ordered the caprese salad as her entree. It cost $8.95. They brought it out, and it had 3 tomato slices and 2 slices of mozzarella. See a trend here?  I ordered the scallions as my entree. It came with 4 scallions on a bed of kale and sautéed carrots. It was ok, but the scallions were a bit rubbery. Once again, I expected more for $27.95.

Wedge Salad - just ok, not enough toppings
Crab Cake Appetizer - best part of the meal 
Boneless Short Rib - meat was dry and chewy, mashed potatoes were gummy
Grilled Scallops - scallops overcooked, more like charred on the grill and had a burnt grill taste to them. Very sandy too. Black rice too undercooked for my taste.

Wines were average. Needless to say we skipped dessert. Service was average although the server &#34;didn&#39;t hear&#34; us order the appetizer so the salad came first, then we asked about the crab cakes and he said he&#39;s get those right out, which he did. I also asked for a side of mashed potatoes with the scallops because I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d like the black rice. The server brought me the wrong potatoes ... I just ate the ones he brought because I just didn&#39;t want to complain again after the missed appetizer. Then come the over-grilled, sandy scallops and I was just getting really mad because this was supposed to be a nice date night, turned into an expensive waste of time and of a precious night out. Grrr. Honestly, it seemed like the scallops were cooked on a dirty grill that hadn&#39;t been cleaned in awhile. They were just gross and left a funny metallic taste in my mouth. 

The following couple days my husband tried a few times to call and talk to a manager at Fiora&#39;s and after no answer and no call back he just gave up. Lesson learned. Just because it&#39;s got a &#34;best&#34; rating and expensive prices does not mean it&#39;s going to be good. 

Our next date night we went to Isacco Kitchen in St. Charles. We&#39;ve been there 4 or 5 times now and it is always fabulous. Really, Isacco is the best restaurant in the area.

They don&#39;t open it until dinner time which irritated me. But my dad came into town from Texas and he likes eating at nice places so after reading some reviews I decided to give them a try. It wa s Tuesday night and as soon as we walked in it smelled very musty. As we followed the host to the seat, the smell of what I can only describe as cat pee was the next bad odor. They sat us at a table in an area with all of the other patrons - a glass encassed &#34;sunroom&#34; area if you will. Although it was a pretty view, since there is no carpet, it is very loud. I was expecting a quiet table for 4. Two women next to us were drinking martinis, high fiving and laughing and talking so loud we had to say something (not the restaurant&#39;s fault but they should spread table out in two different areas). We orderd a bottle of the house Pinot Grigio but my dad was paying so I&#39;m not sure how much it was. $30 maybe? We all ordered the wedge salad which was very good. We had just finished our salad when the server brough out the entrees. He didnt pick up the salad plates - of which we had to hand them to him. This was such an elementary error on the servers part it was the icing on the cake. The waitress was overly nice like a previous reviewer stated. My husband ordered the scallops which he didnt rave about, my daughter ordered the cous cous which she liked and my dad and I ordered a Seafood Fra Diavolo.

That was the only question that has been running through my mind since we dined here with our Chef neighbors Saturday night atround 8:30 pm...... 

Place is beautiful, well laid-out, with a really nice L shaped bar, and tables outside on the patio..... 

We were promptly seated when we arrived and I was surprised because there were only 4 or 5 other tables seated. We had Liz as our waitress and she made great recommendations, is very cute, but was a bit slow with service (especially with the light crowd). 

Did I say the place is beautiful....it really is spectacular..... 

Food was really solid, not great, but solid. Menu has fewer choices then I would have imagined. I had the sharp cheddar plate first and it was EXCELLENT, then had the salmon for dinner and it was ok, kind of plain, but decent. My wife LOVED the Walleye special, and they all enjoyed the flat bread pizza as an app. 

At desert time, my mind wandered to Grahm&#39;s located across the street, and the girls were kind enough to go across the street and buy some chocolate covered pretzels while we waited for the desserts they ordered...... 

A fun night, neat place, ok service (see the other reviews), and decent food. 

We are going to return to have dinner or desert on the patio.....

She was everything I expected and so was the dining experience at Fiora&#39;s. We were greeted at the door by 2 lovelies handling the seating. Res for 6:30 and they took us to our table in one of the dining areas. My sweet told me that the building used to be a Real Estate office. The multi room layout provides intimacy to the dining experience. We ordered beverages and did not even look at the menu until after the drinks were served. We were not rushed at all. Our waiter explained the two specials, but we looked online at the menu and knew what we were ordering. My lady had the soup du jour and she enjoyed it. I passed as I wanted to savor the boneless pork shanks (great sauce) with fingerling potatoes. The lady had her heart set (sorry but not on me) on the scallops. Above average execution of both dishes. My date ate every bite of the scallops and I was not a slouch with the pork. Servers and staff were very attentive without rushing us or being overly attentive. Dessert was offered, but we passed. I enjoyed the smallish menu. To me it reflects a chef who wants to serve the best of fewer items than trying to be a master of none. 
We talked and talked and no one rushed us at all. 
I would definitely go back in the summer with seating in the sun room. A great view.
Upscale dining for &#34;adults&#34;. 
It was well worth the price.

I started with the estate salad, and it was good (though I hate long strings of cucumber; give me wedges, man), but the dressing was...off.  Too citrusy, maybe?  And I&#39;m a citrus worshipper.  My fish was good, except that the sauce had no taste, and some of the root vegetables were dodgy, in that I don&#39;t eat yams.  Or carrots.  Or weird tasting white ones.  That makes it sounds worse than it was--the piece of fish was lovely, and cooked just right.  Everyone else pretty much enjoyed their meals.  The caesar was too cheesy, though.  And the pretzel bun for the burger might have been just a little overpowering.

Anh.  It was good.  I might go back, because in Geneva, this is a good addition to the dining scene."

It&#39;s a fave get away for a day at least once a month for the family! The patio and all looked so inviting , so we put our names down for an available table by a very nice hostess! They called us to sit- and the &#39;table for 5&#39; was one of us sitting at a corner -UGH! ok- then the dirty table! Then the bread basket and butter but no silverware-UGH! Then the waiter comes round -james i think? with what i can only describe as disgust in having to serve us! UGH! He takes our drink orders and we started talking about the bread but no knife to use the butter- and a lady over hears us and commands someone to place silverware at our table , meanwhile we r so FREAKING close to table that they r staring at us as if we r intruders! Then to get up its so close my hair touches her as i get up and she starts banging her chair over- I apologized I was so close - couldnt help taht ! UGH! The the menus- $14. for a burger with frozen fries ! UGH!  BTW the burgers are so not worth it! If you want good burgers try the country house or geneva ale house! BECAUSE everything else on t else on their menu was over $25. for these teeny portions taht wouldnt fill a kid up! UGH! We go to the washroom- upon stepping in the place we smell mold--and in the ladies room its so strong i almost was sick! SOOO  SOO not worth it! the 3 best resturant in past 3 yrs review has got to be &#39;fixed&#39; this place i gave one star bc you could eat outside and the hostess was so nice! Cost us $90. for stress, crappy burgers n fries and a crab cake appetizer and 5 soft drinks! Of course we left a 15% tip on top of that , but i don&#39;t think that waiter enjoyed his job there at all! NEVER again!

That can sometimes affect service when there are only two of you. But we didn&#39;t feel either rushed or ignored. LeRoy was our server--his recommendations were spot on and he&#39;s got a good sense of humor. My husband and I shared the crab cakes, which were light and delicious and served on a red pepper sauce. We then split the seasonal salad that had some fun ingredients--roasted beets, candied walnuts and apples--served over greens with a light vinaigrette. Very good. For an entrée I had the beef bourguignon with garlic mashed potatoes (comfort food does not get any better), and my husband had Chilean sea bass served on risotto, which was a special. Both dishes were excellent. I like that the menu includes both a wine and a beer recommendation for each entrée. We were too full for dessert, which is a pity because the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding looked amazing. Next time."

I strongly recommend the Wild Mushroom Soup, the Filet Minon, and the cheesecake for dessert.  My Filet was cooked perfectly to medium.  Probably the best cheesecake I&#39;ve had in ages.

The service started out not so great and ended up well.  The waitress seemed to be rushing us and took our comment that we didn&#39;t want to rush in good stride.  Water glasses weren&#39;t tended to.  We had our appetizers with our menus in our laps which I hate.  Dirty dishes not removed with speed causing us to shuffle the table as courses were served.

Our waiter arrived and seemed stressed. His manner was a bit terse, not rude, just not at all friendly. I asked if the honey mustard sauce on the salmon was sweet. His reply, &#34;I had some customers tell me last night that it was the best salmon they ever had&#34;. Well that is very nice but please describe the sauce.

Everyone ordered salad and entrees. The salads came and were delicious. I had the spinach salad, very tasty. The majority of the table had the wedge salad and gave it good marks. After my salad I ordered a glass of the Semillon, the pour was not healthy.

No one was exactly overwhelmed by their entree. Seemed everyone&#39;s dish was good, I took a chance and ordered the salmon with the honey mustard sauce, thankfully not sweet, sautéed chard and butternut squash orzo. The salmon was good, though pretty rare in the center. The orzo was overcooked but well-seasoned; however, it had never seen butternut squash during its preparation.

As our entrees were being cleared our waiter came with menus to ask if we wanted to order coffee and/or dessert. He warned us that we would have to order quickly as it was 9:10, the restaurant closed at 9:00 and the kitchen closed at 9:30. We were all surprised and felt like we were getting pushed. I split a piece of cheesecake with friends. We agreed that it was not worth the calories. The flavor was okay, bit bland, and the texture was dreadful. It was super hard and seemed congealed, like eating a stick of cold butter. We did not finish it. The banana bread pudding got rave reviews though. 

We walked through the dining room on our way out and saw our waiter sitting at a table with another server and many people hanging out in the lounge. Interesting that our waiter never thought to tell us that we could go up there and continue our evening. It felt like he was more interested in being finished than making our experience a great one. 

The food was fine and our service was very good and comfortable, other than the waiter&#39;s mien. Overall, for the same money, go to Francesca&#39;s (where we were the night before with a large party) the food is better and they treat you like they have been waiting for you to arrive. The only truly GREAT thing at Fiora&#39;s is the lovely private room."

Big fan of outdoor dining in nice weather, comfortable seating, good people watching. Food was okay, on the pricey side for a hamburger and a chicken  sandwich. Had read about cheesecake before going, but were told they didn&#39;t have anymore. Mentioned it was our anniversary to server, no perks offered, not even a happy anniversary. Went back later for wine tasting and was told they weren&#39;t offering the wine I was interested in. Sad face. Still, an overall okay experience; might go back to sit outside in nice weather."

I loved the toasted cumin cream swirled in my bowl of soup (at least that what I think it was!).  We also had the Duck Leg Posole (confit) with hominy and corn in a broth, it was tender and divine.  Such as nice combination.  Prime beef pierogi was done right and the horseradish creme kicked it up to spectacular.  Grilled baby octopus was good but unfortunately I was comparing it to a recent octopus salad that was the bomb, and didn&#39;t quite have that tenderness.  Nice outdoor seating."

The first couple times I sat in the bar area and enjoyed wine and a cheese plate.  The wine list is extensive and well priced.  The do-it-yourself cheese plate is a great idea and, of course, delicious.  But-you can&#39;t go wrong with cheese.  The only negative I have in reference to these first couple of experiences is that the service was about the worst I could have imagined.  The &#34;Bar Manager&#34;, Greg, I believe, was inattentive to the point that we felt completely ignored...until of course, he dished out his phone number to a married friend of mine.  Perhaps the position shouldn&#39;t be taken so lightly.

My most recent experience was much more pleasant.  I was there for dinner...and upon making the reservation was given especially personal and attentive service.  The hostess asked if it was a special occassion...which it was...and sat us accordingly; next to the fireplace.  Our server (I unfortunately can&#39;t remember her name) was sincere and welcoming and immediately offered the services of the in-house wine expert as we were eyeing the wine list.  The wine expert was fantastic.  She was engaging, funny, and knowledgable.  Our server made reccomendations for our entrees and we took them.  The food was great, service was great, and atmosphere outstanding.

The appetizer I had was a special of duck leg off the bone with a liver pate sauce served over French fries. I was taken off guard with the French fries did not really go with duck. I would have rated 5 stars if the appetizer did not have French fries.

The main course was a sturgeon filet with a peach sauce served with potatoes. The filet was thick and cooked to perfection! The fish is line caught and from the northern hemisphere. I feel so many places are serving fish from salt water and forget that there are other species that have great flavor and texture. I look forward to going back."

The desserts were exceptional - cheesecake and the whitechocloate creme brulee with a hint of orange.  Delicious all around.

They also have interesting and tasty thin crust pizza choices are also, pastas, fresh seasonal vegetables and intetesting salads. I don&#39;t know what to call out as everything was exceptionally tasty, but the Blackened Salmon Quinoa Spinach Salad was excellent as was the Pear and Carmelized Onion thin crust pizza and the Beets and Farro with pistachio and balsamic glaze.

I&#39;ve had the prosciutto and fig appetizer. After sitting at the bar I saw the giant prosciutto in the slicer that is freshly sliced with each order. Yum!!!
The Italian chopped salad was delicious and each bite had something really tasty in it. 
The VEAL MEATBALLS were the best! 3 nice sized meatballs on a bed of polenta that was so rich and creamy almost seemed like it was cheese instead of polenta. The sauce on the meatballs was really a home run.

Finally the pizza... the first time I had the gluten free mushroom and the second time I had the sopresata regular pizza. Their gluten free pizza is really thin and crisp. The regular pizza was a bit thicker but also good.

We stopped in Saturday night (a little after 8) and there were plenty of open tables. Our server was great and perfectly attentive. We even met one of the owners/chef, and despite having kinda negative views of yelp and yelpers, he was super nice  and very enjoyable to talk with.  

We started with some draft beers and a tomato, basil, eggplant, bruschetta with creamy burrata cheese.  This was incredibly tasty! The combo of crispy toast, roasted veggies, creamy burrata, and tangy balsamic was perfect.  Next we had a salad featuring grilled peaches, mozzarella,  sliced fennel, arugula and fresh blueberries with a lemon balsamic vinaigrette. Again, AWESOME and the mixture of flavors was well crafted and perfectly balanced.  

We finished off with a Hammaker&#39;s Pie. Pretty standard meaty pie with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms. Pizza was good, slightly less impressive than the two previous courses, but still delicious and very much satisfying. It was nicely crisped, and surprisingly not oily given all the meat. 

Overall, fantastic meal, and their menu looked to be loaded with plenty more stellar offerings to try.  And the wine.... We&#39;ll be back for sure!"

We ordered the mozzarella flight that came with three pieces of mozzarella (the first was creamy and extremely fresh on a bed of peppery arugula, the second was drizzles with balsamic vinaigrette on top of a sweet tomato, and the third was topped with a fresh pesto).  I could have eaten that whole flight by myself...so fresh and flavorful!

However, I was put off from the very start by the noise; with laminate floors and wood paneling around the entire restaurant, the noise bounces off the walls and assaults you from every angle. My husband and I were on a two-top and could barely hear each other across the table, though I could hear quite a lot of the conversation around me.

That wood paneling around the restaurant also creates a very rustic/outdoorsy odor that reminded me - and not in a good way - of my days as a Girl Scout. While the smells from the kitchen certainly helped mask the odor a bit, it was hard for me to get over.

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the mozzarella flight, which sounded great, was a bit of a joke. The only difference between the three small mounds of mozzarella was the accompaniment (balsamic, pesto, etc.). I enjoyed it, don&#39;t get me wrong, but was expecting a bit more. Ironically, the margherita pizza I had was lacking in mozzarella and basil (and flavor, unsurprisingly). My husband, on the other hand, enjoyed his appetizer and entree, so perhaps I just &#34;lucked&#34; out.

Yet, I won&#39;t be back. The final topper was when it took us 10 minutes to flag down our waitress for a drink refill. She was incredibly friendly, but clearly overwhelmed and inattentive."

From start to finish we enjoyed our visit to Gia Mia.

First, the food and drink: we started with Prosciutto and Figs, then Baby Carrots and Beans, the Bolognese pasta and the Livia pizza.  Can&#39;t give you the specific name of the red wine, the Spanish one, but it was reasonably priced with a generous pour, offering a deep rich taste which warmly accompanied the meal throughout. 

A wide array of items, a wide array of fresh delectable tastes.

The Livia pizza was a perfect combination of slightly crunchy outer edge and chewiness with a wonderful spice to the soprasetta.  My taste of my partner&#39;s Bolognese (gluten free) was impressive.

Think fresh, light and tasty for the servings of carrots and beans, and the prosciutto and figs served with greens and a light, enhancing dressing.

Added to all this was a friendly, enthusiastic server who offered comments if asked for anything on the menu--she had tried it all (lucky server!).   

Their approach to call ahead and phone text alerts is spot-on well done!

OK, onto the menu. I was torn between the sausage/pesto and clam/bacon pizzas. One of the bar guys recommended the latter so I went with it. The 12-inch wood fired masterpiece came out within 15 minutes. It had chopped Neuske&#39;s bacon, clams, olive oil, mozzarella, fontina, roasted garlic bechamel, and fresh herbs. For parmesan, there were no shakers, but they brought me a small silver dish of a high quality parmesan. 

The crust was crispy all the way through, which is huge for me. Also, the bechamel helped  keep the pizza moist. So often with tomato-free pizzas, it can get really dry. Thankfully, that didn&#39;t happen with this pizza. I would certainly order it again. For $14, it was a very reasonable price. I noticed some of the pasta dishes and appetizers passing by me and the presentations were incredibly well done as well. 

Gia Mia is a small restaurant with fair (not cheap, not expensive) prices, but they use high-quality ingredients, which results in great flavors, and it&#39;s a great spot for a date. It&#39;s certainly a spot I&#39;ll be going back to."

Add Gia Mia to the list of Geneva restaurants that blew my taste buds away. We had the zucchini fritters which were good, Tuscan shrimp had the perfect amount of kick, charred cauliflower which I was not a fan of but the table loved it. The garlic bread that they bring out to the table is absolutely amazing. The main reason I loved this restaurant was the main entree. I ordered the Pata Bolognese and it was flavorful, the pasta was prepared perfectly. This may be one of the best pasta dishes I&#39;ve ever had. Finally, our server Emma was fantastic.  She was knowledgeable and it felt like she was extremely proud of the restaurant."

Highly recommend the whipped ricotta with honey comb and the pillows of pasta dish!! We couldn&#39;t decide what to order so we ordered 4 appetizers and 2 salads!!

Every time we go to dinner the food comes out amazingly fast and hot. The items are plated with such care. The starters are some of the best in the Geneva area. The mozzarella sampler is a must try each of the three offerings is outstanding with really high quality cheese. The pizzas are the perfect size with really fresh toppings.

They are not open Sundays and that is odd to me with that being a day to lounge around and a quick dinner and glass of wine is always welcome after a busy weekend. 

Also the first few times we went we didn&#39;t really know what to expect when you walk in with pictures of children on the walls and a beach with the rest of the decor being so rustic. Not the upscale look of downtown Geneva.

We will keep coming for dinner since the food is wonderful from really kind waitstaff."

We had some wine at my house then went to Gia Mia. We had called ahead to get on &#34;the list&#34; for 7, ended up waiting at the bar for 15 minutes or so and ......drinking some wine. Once we got to the table, we ordered one bottle of wine (which eventually became two).

So, what do I remember? Well, wine. I remember wine. I also remember and loved the Burrata cheese...along with the ricotta cheese and honeycomb. (Yes, a real honey comb). We had pizza, we had........other stuff.........and we had a great night. Go here. Have some wine (very good wines at all price points by the way).

One recommendation: It&#39;s loud. Wood floor, glass, lots of hard surfaces. This is THE PERFECT PLACE to take a date you don&#39;t want to listen to! Other than the noise level, this is an excellent restaurant and a welcome addition to the high quality places we already have in Geneva."

I had found that to be very generous, as he actually acknowledged my concerns. I decided to give GM a second chance. I live and work much closer to the Wheaton location. Unfortunately, my second experience was much worse than the first. After speaking to the manager for a second time about the same issue having reoccurred at both locations, he was profusely apologetic and extremely kind. He allowed for me to try GM for a third time at no charge (even though I honestly had zero interest at that point). I was blown away by the meal that I received. Management gets 5 stars. The only reason that my review contains 4 stars is because I feel that the level of service is not consistent from management to the rest of the staff. Perhaps my best recommendation would be to implement more training. I might be a returning customer now. But I&#39;ll still be timid."

Our server was Brittany and she was spectacular. She had great suggestions with food and drinks. We started with the sausage pesto pizza and it was amazing.
I had the stuffed pasta, listed as an appetizer , and I couldn&#39;t believe the flavors in this dish.  There are figs, spinach &amp; pears in this dish and the flavors explode in your mouth. My friend had the large rigatoni noodles with vodka sauce and also so flavorful. We ended our meal with the Panna cotta with blueberry sorbet and couldn&#39;t have been happier!

There is something about cooking a pizza for only a couple of minutes that makes it not as yummy as one that comes out piping hot &amp; retains its heat. This place is a nice addition to the Geneva restaurant scene &amp; has lovely ambience and decor, but, in my opinion, they need to switch it up a little to keep a customer&#39;s pizza one that retains its heat."

I was greeted promptly and offered a couple of choice to be seated. My server, Emily was welcoming and after learning that this was my first visit, gave me a quick overview of the menu.  I had read the menu online beforehand, so I was able to order immediately. There were salads, small plates, sort of like tapas, and some heartier entrée&#39; items on the menu, but the 11 inch, thin crust wood fired pizzas were the feature, and the reason I had come. I was told that the dough was made in-house daily with flour imported from Italy. There are ten or twelve pizza choices, pre-designed by the chef, rather than the customer choosing his or her toppings, and sauces, but each was unique and I chose the Hammakers (?) pie which featured Italian sausage and pepperoni with tomato, mushrooms, herbs and cheese. To my surprise my order was delivered to my table in no more than 5 minutes. My server explained that the wood-fired oven baked at temperatures in excess of 700 degrees, and the pizzas cook to perfection in 90 seconds. The crust was wonderfully flavorful, and the entire pizza a delight. I&#39;m a pretty healthy eater, but the portion satisfied me. But I was tempted towards desert, and enjoyed a scoop of gelato. Emily, my server was knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients, made me feel welcome, and left me wanting for nothing. I will absolutely return soon!"

Then we ordered the Hammakers Pizza (really good!). The server for dinner said &#34;rock on&#34; at least 10 times, no joke. Also, this is a Tapas style dining experience. All dishes were brought out at once.....mind you we were at a two top.....they managed to squeeze everything on the table after knocking my reading glasses off the table (their wasn&#39;t even enough room for my reading glasses). Love the concept of the water bottle left on the table as it was very convenient however, it tastes like hose water.....ya know, like when you were a kid and grabbed the hose to drink water out of on a hot Summer day. I gave this an additional star because the manager/owner was very present.....both at lunch and dinner (went in the same day).

We took home half a pizza and a small amount of pasta and we were so full. We had asked the very attentive staff how to order, and they were incredibly helpful.

I could make four pizzas with better ingredients and a better crust at home for the price we paid. The menu claimed it had about 8 nice ingredients on it, but it tasted like cheap chihuahua cheese and not much else. Another in my party got the grilled chicken, which was loaded with chicken fat. I mean really, fatty chicken? It looked gross. The waitress was a sweetheart, but that didn&#39;t make up for how blah the food was.

Food is beyond good and generous portions, even the small plates. The decor is simple, clean and warm. The waitress is friendly, efficient and knows all about the food. She anticipated our needs and was ready with separate checks because our party was large. The only2 suggestions I&#39;d  make would be that the music is a bit loud for conversation and something needs to be done at the front door to keep the cold or hot air from hitting you in the back when people go in and out the front door. I would suggest using the material that was used on the bar chairs to make a curtain that could be hung as an extension of the small wall by the front door. The curtain could be tied back to look contemporary."

There is no close second place, and I love how they stick to their guns. This family goes above and beyond and does things their way... it is terrific 

Burger: Tremendous griddle-style burger with a killer potato bun. Better than Au Cheval and a ridiculous value. 

Beef: Perfect dip, top-quality beef, and the best giardinera I&#39;ve ever had.

Hot dog: This is a DEPRESSION STYLE DOG made famous on the South and West sides during the 1920&#39;s (a la Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s). It is more Chicago than that &#34;drag it through the garden&#34; option and covered in HAND-CUT fries. For those who are not impressed and who want an &#34;authentic Chicago-style Dog,&#34; try the concession stand at Schaumburg Flyers stadium. No factory made poppy-seed buns or frozen links here.

Porchetta Sandwich: The recipe for this alone sandwich alone could get Illinois out of debt. Try it an then take one home for later. It is the best fast-food sandwich in Chicago right now. 

Other can&#39;t-miss items: Homemade meatball sandwich, homemade tamales, homemade Italian Ice... pretty much anything homemade. Who else makes their items by hand? DEFINITELY not Portillo&#39;s.

There are not too many authentic, family-run businesses around, especially those who are so selective about everything that makes it onto their menu. Any rating on this site less than 5-stars is a travesty likely left by someone who would be better suited for lunch at a mall food court."

The decor inside was very nice. And all the employees had chef coats on. Different but ok. The hot dog was not hot. Luke warm and they only put mustard relish onion hot pepper   aka depression dog   The fries where ok nothing special, the fries at Michael&#39;s Dawghouse are better 
If I want that kind of dog I would go to Rand red hots. 
I will give them another try"

Hot dogs = 0 stars!  Parking = non existent! No poppy seed buns, no pickle spears, no chopped tomatoes, minced onion not chopped, weak relish not even bright green and no celery salt!!!  I can make a better dog at home!  Fries were greasy and soggy.  So we won&#39;t be going back.  Woman working the cash register was rude too.

Jimmy is probably rolling in his grave.....Ange killed the Chicago hot dog!!!!

Next stop Johnny&#39;s on Arl. Hts. road, Portillo&#39;s or anywhere that knows and understands what a REAL Chicago dog is all about!"

Anyone that complains about the food here should put their head in a toilet and flush it a couple of times because you are full of number 2! You 1 star people are use to McDonald&#39;s and always eatin a Mc this or a Mc that but seriously you are full of McS(beeeep)t or a McTootsie Roll to be politically correct in this crazy world! Don&#39;t get your panties in a bunch like they already are you 1 star people.

Now to the food: The food is absolutely delicious! No matter what you eat here. I&#39;ve eaten at 5 star restaurants and went okay this suck&#39;s worse than eating an ingrown toenail on a Friday night sitting on the couch alone watching Netflix. 

The food here is amazing plain an simple! The homemade meatballs are so deliciously delicious that you would think you died and went to heaven and saw Mother Theresa doing the Irish gig that is how good the meat a balls are. 

Let&#39;s get to the Tri-tip sandwich! All I will say is dear mother of moooooskies the owners take pride in their cooking and it shows... 

To the 1 stars that don&#39;t know anything about home-cut French fries. This place gives you a pound of freaking delicious French Fries, are you kidding me? 1 star complains about ohhh they don&#39;t have cheese sauce! Well sweetheart you want cheese for your fries than GO MILK A GOAT AND PUT YELLOW #7 IN IT IF YOU WANT YOUR DAMN CHEESE FRY SAUCE! The other 1 star complains about how small the fries were, are you kidding me? The fries are so huge even John Holmes would approve!

The Italian Ice... I don&#39;t have to drive in the city anymore! It is homemade and oooooh so delicious!

Now to the 1 stars that complain about the hours... You don&#39;t make the rules! They do! You don&#39;t pay taxes on their property they do. Read the hours of operation, they are closed at 7pm! Do you 1 stars think you can go into your local McDonalds and say hey I know your closing but I want a McDouble... The workers will give you 2 McFingers as they&#39;re kicking your McA** out! So don&#39;t complain about the hours of operation. 

This is a family owned restaurant! They are a good family and I don&#39;t even know them. The food is incredible for the price and running a restaurant that has quality food made by quality chefs speaks volumes on what they are feeding us...

Ohhh...To the 1 star that claims the parking suck&#39;s and he doesn&#39;t want to be a fatality. Well genius open your eyeballs and put toothpicks in them if you can&#39;t see cars in their parking lot!!! Even Stevie Wonder can see that the parking lot is small and it has always been small because you brain never visited Jimmy&#39;s place! The parking lot hasn&#39;t changed in over 50 years!

Last thing... You won&#39;t be disappointed folks! They are new in the business and like everything else in life it takes time to work the kinks out but seriously I&#39;ve seen worse in established restaurants... This family is awesome and love their community and that is the most important.. 

1 star people have no idea what it is like to run a business! They throw rocks at other people&#39;s businesses and think it is cute to write a negative review on someones hard work when it is simply not true. I&#39;m sorry that you keyboard commandos feel compelled and oh so powered to write garbage when you never ran a restaurant! I hope you feel better now that you did that because at the end of the day you live a miserable life in your glass house but want to cast stones on others when your claims are not valid...

We went for lunch today and ordered an Italian Beef, Petite Cheeseburger, &amp; Hot Dog.

The Italian Beef was Tasty but def no comparison to your Chicago Style Beef like Al&#39;s, Johnnies, Portillo&#39;s, etc.  

The Petite Cheeseburger was good but nothing out of the ordinary.

We were really looking forward to the Hot Dog/Fries.  The Fries were really Good (Fresh Cut) but unfortunately we were disappointed with the Hot Dog.  Not sure of the brand they use but def not Vienna &amp; it lacked in taste, snap, and the typical Chicago style toppings.

If you&#39;re looking for a Mediocre Suburban joint for lunch/dinner at reasonable prices then Big Ange&#39;s is your place.  If you grew up in Chicago around the best Beef &amp; Hot Dog joints like I did, there is no comparison &amp; you might be disappointed."

Was really excited to try out the food. Picked up the Italian porchetta sandwich and it was excellent! Wasn&#39;t sure what to get but spoke with one of the owners and he suggested it. Nice and porky - super tender. Could have eaten it straight out of the bun - it was that good. 

My daughter ordered the signature cheeseburger. She&#39;s a cheeseburger snob and but it got the thumbs up!

The italian ice was delicious! Pieces of fruit embedded  - not too sweet and just tart enough. 

My only complaint were the fries. Should have stayed in the fryer for a few minutes more. A little underdone.

Really good food and decent prices."

I would have never ordered this kind of sandwich if it weren&#39;t for the sample they gave us when walked in. We both couldn&#39;t help from ordering the whole sandwich. The cashier was so friendly and very helpful in guiding us through the menu. We got 2 drinks, 2 sandwiches and a fry to share- it was $25. Little more expensive but worth it ! The only reason I put 4 stars is because the parking is a mess. Only a few spots on either side of the building. We had to do circles to find a spot in and out of a busy intersection. But everything else was great! We will be back to try other menu items."

And to call it a hot dog place would be like calling the Chicago Marathon a stroll down the city streets with a few friends.  This place has freshly made food from scratch, like the tamales, meatballs, Italian ice, and dessert pies. 

I&#39;ve been anxious for this place to open because I&#39;ve been passing it for years and watching its transformation. So when I saw some cars in the parking lot tonight I stopped in for a quick meal.  Rocco, one of the owners, was so friendly and welcoming, but apologized that he is still a week from officially opening.  When he saw my disappointment he immediately said, &#34;I made meatballs.  Would you like some?&#34;  I asked if I could take it to go and he said, &#34;I&#39;ll make you a sandwich.&#34;  He couldn&#39;t have been nicer.  I could tell he&#39;s very excited to share his food with people.  After he wrapped up the sandwich, he said, &#34;Come try some of my homemade Italian ice!&#34;  There were 2 couples in the restaurant and we all went over to the case and got a serving.  I got his lemon ice and it was wonderful!  When I got home I ate the meatball sandwich.  I love Italian food and rarely am disappointed when I eat it. It&#39;s such a comfort food for me. So even when it&#39;s so-so, I enjoy it. But every so often there is the Italian food that stands far above the rest. Regina&#39;s on Campbell and Vail (now Carlos &amp; Carlos) used to have that kind of Italian food. Great red sauces, fresh ingredients and handmade all kindza stuff.  Ever since Regina&#39;s closed I&#39;ve been looking for that kind of spectacular tasting Italian food. Well when I took the first bite of the meatball sandwich I realized I&#39;d found it again. The red sauce on the meatballs was so good I wanted to rush back and get more.  It has a flavor that makes you want to put it in a bowl, tear off a piece of fresh bread and eat it like soup!  

I&#39;m so excited to know this place is more of an improvement than just the building and decor. I know it will be a frequent stop for me. My only hope is that Rocco will offer his sauce in containers to go!"

They are still building their menu and items so I will have to revisit again in a few months to give it another try. I ordered a cheeseburger and my sister ordered an Italian beef. They don&#39;t currently have any cheese for the Italian beef so my sister was a little disappointed. I was also hoping for cheese fries but they didn&#39;t have cheese for that either :(. The burger and fries were good. Nothing over the top.

The food is incredible, the staff is so friendly, and the atmosphere is fun. 

I was a little nervous ordering their signature burger - no lettuce and tomatoes here! Instead they have a spicy Dijon mayo/mustard, pickles, and minced red onion. I honestly wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d like it since I generally am not a fan of those things. But my mother in law had been to Big Ange&#39;s before us and told me she had the same reservations but I had to try it and I&#39;d change my mind. After the first bite I knew she was right. Every day since then I swear I have dreamed of that burger. It is absolutely delicious, and the toppings are perfect, I wouldn&#39;t change a thing!

The fries are plentiful and delicious (you can easily share between 2 or 3 people). They are those nice, substantial fries that still have a little skin on them, and they are cooked perfectly. 

The lemonade is incredible - with a blend of oranges and lemons it&#39;s like nothing you&#39;ve had before.

My father in law had a meatball sub and my husband had a beef and gave rave reviews for each, but I honestly don&#39;t know if I can stray from my delicious burger to try anything else.

Save room for Italian Ice! It&#39;s homemade and there are a bunch of different flavors to choose from. 

Overall a great restaurant that will hopefully become a staple in the community! We love Big Ange&#39;s!"

The good:
The burger is great. 
$3.25 for a hot dog and good fries is a great deal.
Fries are really good as long as you are eating in.
All the flavors of homemade ices made with fresh fruit.
The ambiance inside and the outdoor space outside.

The bad:
The service is pretty bad...they have no idea how to handle a rush, and if you&#39;re taking your food to go be sure you check your bags or you will be back for whatever it is they forgot.
They need to toast the sandwich buns.
The fries are a soggy mess if you take your food to go.
PUT SOME ICE IN THE DRINKS!
Everything on a hot dog should include tomatoes!"

We tried to go on the day the ran out of food and were closed. Went back the next week and found the burger to have a mushy bun and very little choice of condiments. Portions were inconsistent. The three of us all had vastly different amounts of fries.The fries were also inconsistently cooked, some white and mushy inside, and some very dark.

The decor is conflicted. They have a 50&#39;s pastel palette on the walls, but the staff wear primary colors and the artwork is a mix of blues musicians and what looks like Caribbean inspired art. No music playing, even though they have music notes painted on the walls. 

Not much atmosphere,  inconsistent food. I can think of a half dozen other places that sell the same food, but do it better."

We stopped here for lunch and are talking about going for dinner before they close today ;0 

Tamales are homemade and authentic. The tri tip sandwich is filled with tender slices of beef and the potato roll they serve it on is soft and fresh. The burgers are cooked perfectly, comes with their own special sauce and you can add bacon :) whatever the sauce is it is tasty. 

They always have specials, this last time we.visited we picked up a lb of rib tips, soooo good, better than most BBQ joints I&#39;ve visited, they season everything perfectly. My husband also got the BBQ brisket sandwich special, filled with tender meat just like the tri tip was! 

AND they also have homemade deserts,different options both times we have visited. The peach cobbler was to die for, they topped it with fresh whipped cream too! We haven&#39;t tried the Italian ice yet but plan on it for the next visit, they have like 6 different flavors to choose from all homemade 

Yeah, their parking lot isn&#39;t the greatest... but for food this good I really don&#39;t care! Glad it is a close drive to home, one of my new favorites for a filling lunch!!!"

It was incredible! Great texture, super moist, full of flavor. My husband got the Italian Beef &amp; it was delicious. My young kids split a petite cheeseburger - we of course tasted it &amp; loved that as well! There was a special sauce that made it really stand out. 
We had some Italian ice as well - 6 homemade flavors (almost all made with fresh fruit) to choose from &amp; they were generous in letting us sample.

&#34;Thing&#34;,...the essence of food made with love.
What I tasted was an eggplant parm. sandwich that was succulent and tasted like it was made by my Italian Mama!
The marinara sauce had the most soothing end taste notes,that brought a satisfying smile to my face.
Very yummy and very satisfying.

The hand cut fries, doubled fried the old school way,tasted great. Just the right amount of soaked oil but not greasy to the touch. They were served in a brown lunch bag, old school presentation.

I had a Lemmon Italian ice. It was very good. It looked and tasted homemade. I wished it was made with a lot less lemon rind bits. The rind bits were a little overwhelming.

The omvionce of the resturant was awesome. I enjoyed the modern yet nostalgic vibe as I savored my lunch. The bathroom well decorated that reminded me of my rich Aunt&#39;s powder room. lol

I look forward to tasting and enjoying another lunch there soon.
Absolutly worth the tight  parking situation.

Delicious food with abundant portions at an economical price.  

I had the meatball sandwich which was perfect.  Just enough sauce to need a few extra napkins.  The 3 meatballs could have been by themselves, they were done great and didn&#39;t need the sauce to bring them back to life.  The sauce was a good balance of tomato and seasoning not too sweet or acidic.  I&#39;m picky as I have Taylor Street as my local Italian food.  Fresh cut fries which were just crispy on the outside, the portion is great to share which we did.  Finished it off with a cantaloupe Italian ice, refreshing and oh so yummy.  

Others in our group had the Italian beef with sweet peppers, I&#39;m getting that next time, it looked mouth watering good.  Polish sausage with caramelized onions.  Cheeseburger with the works.  They group sampled more of the eight flavors of Italian ice.  All of us walked away stuffed and happy with our choices and thinking about next time. 

The decor is light and airy which helped to detract from watching the Cubs loss on the muted big screen tv.  Tunes in the background were at the right balance to give energy to the place without overwhelming our conversation.  

Staff were friendly, helpful, and conscientious about environment. 

Kudos to Big Ange&#39;s looking forward to my next time to try that Italian beef or maybe the Porchetta..."

I had a hot dog with fries and the Italian &#34;porchetta&#34; pork sandwich.  The hot dog was a pretty standard Chicago style hot dog, and I mean that in a good way!  The fries were delicious too.  The porchetta blew me away.  The combination of the roasted pork, herbs, spices, and basil mayo came together for a really great sandwich.  If you don&#39;t know what to get on your first visit, I definitely recommend that one to everyone.  I also had a blue raspberry Italian ice which was quite good.  They have a decent selection of flavors to choose from including watermelon, pina colada, lemon, strawberry, and a few others.  I&#39;ll definitely be trying some of the other flavors on future visits.

Nice atmosphere with all the rock &#39;n roll and blues inspired decorations.  The staff was incredibly friendly too.  My friend and I were leaving right before they closed, and they gave us a couple of free sandwiches on our way out so they didn&#39;t have to toss away the left overs."

The eggplant was perfectly cooked and the marinara sauce was great on the sandwich! The fries were perfect! Personally, I like a LOT of ice in my drinks so to me the lemonade was not cold enough but it was very nice! The staff there was warm, welcome, and friendly. My favorite thing was the Italian ice.

Went in this evening around 6:30 pm and it was hopping. First problem you have to walk through seated diners to get to register. There was a wait so some kid was giving out free samples of Italian ice and then randomly stopped. Guy at register totally confused overwhelmed etc. I think the owner was ready to leave but had to step in. Then one of the family I think who was schmoozing guests tells his friends in line to sit tight and then buts in and orders for him. Lots and lots of schmoozing. Wait time 8 minutes. 

I order hot dogs with no mustard or relish and they say so just onions and hot peppers? I said what about tomato and pickles? Nope don&#39;t have long pickles, tomato or celery salt. Fries are over $3 comes with fries whether you want them or not. I ordered two tamales sorry no tamales. I ordered the prime rib sandwich with fried onions, but it was $9 and no fries? 

Hot dogs made immediately and sat and sat while some old guy hand cut the prime rib very slowly. Wait time 13 minutes. 

Get the food home and hot dogs were ok, fries good, prime rib delicious. 

So.... Terrible service, hard to park and move about, high prices, out of food, ok food, waiting forever for them to open only to show up and have them closed then try again and they are out of food. I think I&#39;m sufficiently unimpressed which is sad."

They&#39;ve been open approximately 30 days and are new to the neighborhood. I stopped in at 7:03 p.m. the doors were open there were guests on the patio. They just said we&#39;re closed. Staff seemed more interested in a full-blown shutdown then potentially serving a new customer. As a new restaurant I would have hoped they would have been eager to serve a new guest.

We really liked them! The burgers are very good.  I ordered the petite which was a perfect size.  They do not come with ketchup, they come with a dijon mayo red onion and pickles so if that is how you like them, great or order them the way you prefer. The fries are more of a natural cut and you get a generous portion as a side. The Italian beef is very flavorful. There are numerous varieties of Italian ice to try.  They gave us samples, all very good. The meatball sandwich was delicious.  I enjoyed the lemonade. It is a mix of lemons and oranges, very refreshing...not too sweet. They also gave us a free sample of that too. They do give drink refills on soda. The interior of the building is bright and clean. We never had trouble with parking. Nice patio to sit outside."

I stopped here for a takeout at  lunchtime Saturday as I was curious to see the change.  To me, it looks like Gordon Ramsey&#39;s  Restaurant Rescue came through with a clean up, small cooking equipment rearrangement and redecorating, both inside &amp; out. An expanded menu, but not overpowering. We ordered simple.  2 petite cheeseburgers and went with one of their signature sandwiches  Italian Eggplant/Sausage Sandwich Combo. The eggplant is lightly battered and sautéed, topped with provolone cheese, a grilled Italian sausage on an Italian hoagie bun with a lot of red sauce. Quite a mess to eat but delicious. My lunch companions enjoyed their cheeseburgers commenting on the tasty bun and fresh made patty. They compared it with a steak &amp; shake burger and said Big Ange&#39;s Petite Cheeseburger was bigger &amp; better. We all enjoyed the hand cut fries, which were not overly greasy. The Grandma Fridono&#39;s Fresh Squeezed Lemonade made with a blend of lemons and oranges was a pleasant diversion from plain lemonade. All in all great place, pleasant people, and upgraded interior gave it the 5 stars. We&#39;ll go again for sure."

They said they would open before the Cubs won their next World Series, and they did it, Big Ange&#39;s that is.  I do think the Cubs will do it this year also.

My wife and I came here on opening day.  It was fabulous. Everything we had, the Italian Porchetta Pork Sandwich, Beef and Sausage Combo, fries, their homemade lemonade (a blend of lemons and oranges, really different and great tasting), meatball sample and Italian Ice samples were all excellent, no complaints at all.

The inside decor is very light, lively and easy on the eyes.  You can see owner&#39;s Ang and John&#39;s music background with many photos of local bands and a nice sampling of guitars up on the walls.  Reminded me a bit of a mini Hard Rock Cafe.  Even the restroom was great, big, and attractive looking.  The music playing in the background throughout the restaurant was really nice also, good selections, loud enough, but not too loud.  The outside landscaping is excellent looking.  Looks like it has been there for years.  

The restaurant had to close after the first day as they were overwhelmed with customers and ran out of food, first day.  They replenished and reopened after 4 days, also with additional employees to handle the crowds.

I went back today for a takeout order.  The place was comfortably crowded, midafternoon, after lunch time, before dinner time. Today we ordered combos again, hot dog, tamale and fries.  The hot dog was great, nice taste, a good snap to the skin, Vienna for sure. The tamale was really unique.  Here is from their menu...&#34;Handmade &#34;In House&#34; (Pork tamale with smoked green chilies and avocado salsa, wrapped in corn husk)&#34;.  I don&#39;t think I have ever had a better one, even from very authentic Mexican restaurants. 

The entire staff is super friendly.

Make sure to stop if in the area, or even somewhat nearby, you will be glad you did.

Best wishes to Ang, John and their son Rocco.  You guys have a winner here.

The ordering seemed confusing to me, and that went on down the line of people (relatives). The Last person in this line was very nice which made this ordering more palatable. The main reason I&#39;m writing this is while I was sitting eating my food, one of the worker behind the line came out sat down with a customer/friend to talk. Rubbing his pants, chair, hugging his friends, he was wearing his plastic food serving gloves while with his friends. (which look like they have been on for serval hours, should be changed every 20-30 minutes). While I did not follow him back in to the cook line, I&#39;m sure he changed his gloves?

Unlike my former school teachers I&#39;ve decided to opt for the higher number. The employees (owners) seem to be quite sincere about making a go of the business.

I had their double cheeseburger (which they call a &#34;signature cheeseburger&#34;, fries and a tamale. Everything seemed fresh and made to order. The cheeseburger was passable, no more. While a rung above your typical chain fast food burger, the meat just wasn&#39;t very tasty. I did like the fact that they allowed me to substitute a thick onion slice for their standard minced onions. Also, the patties are rather small, just slightly bigger than a McDonald&#39;s junior patty.

The fresh cut fries were very good, flavorful and nicely cooked. The rather unusual pork tamale was also quite good, if a bit pricey.

Their service was friendly and fairly efficient. Others have mentioned the tiny and cramped parking lot which is a serious issue (an accident waiting to happen for every visit). The indoor seating isn&#39;t exactly spacious, but they do have an outdoor patio."

Loved how it was decorated. We were greeted by an extremely friendly staff. John, the owner, gave us free tastes of the meat they use in their Porchata sandwich. SO good!! Definitely getting that next time. My dad and I got hot dogs with everything and fries and my niece got the meatball sub. I was disappointed that the dog didn&#39;t have tomatoes or a sliced pickle but it was good. The fries made up for it. Love fresh cut fries. The meatball sub was fantastic!!  John visited our table and gave us free samples of the homemade Italian ice he makes there. I had the pina colada-pineapple with coconut. Yum!!

The biggest surprise was the eggplant sandwich with sausage, I don&#39;t think I ever would have ordered that , but decided to try it , it was so good . The cheeseburger is outstanding, the meat tastes Absolutely Fresh and the bun just makes it perfect. Don&#39;t mean to go on and on like this but I intend to try everything on the menu , expectations are high and what I&#39;ve tried has not disappointed , it&#39;s exceeded my expectations.

Since they&#39;ve opened, we&#39;ve tried a few items. The Signature Cheeseburger with chopped red onions and dijon mustard/mayo sauce and was AMAZING!!! I never order directly from the menu but one of the owners told me if I didn&#39;t like it he would refund me and give me whatever I like. We loved it! No complaints at all. Perfectly seasoned burger and very tasty. The french fries were also great, well seasoned and delicious. My husband has ordered the Italian beef and he said he liked it a lot more than Portillo&#39;s. A great portion of beef and very flavorful. A friend of ours ordered the hotdog and he said it was pretty standard, and tasted good. I&#39;ve only tasted their lemon ice and strawberry ice. The strawberry was FANTASTIC and extremely addicting. The owner told us it has no additives and only is ice, sugar and strawberries. Super refreshing and delicious on a hot summer day (or anyday)! We live walking distance away and absolutely hope to make this place a normal weekly treat for ourselves! Try them out!!! I should also add the staff were AMAZING and all super nice and helpful. It kinda stinks that they&#39;re closed Monday and Sunday and are only open 11-7 during the days they&#39;re open but I can see them changing that once they get settled and iron out all the kinks!"

I can&#39;t believe it took me this long to eat here. They run a very efficient ship. I love that. The sandwich maker&#39;s line keeps up with their very big lunch rush. There are seats inside, and also there are plenty of benches outside in downtown STC if the weather cooperates. 

I ordered the California turkey. It was delicious. Everything was very fresh and in perfect proportions. The avocado made this sandwich, along with the Breadsmith cracked wheat bread. My friends got 1) the ham steer and recommends it for a try 2) got a plain grilled cheese and enjoyed it and 3) she created her own grilled cheese with apple, onion, tomato and avocado, she loved it and it looked good. Every sandwich comes with a pickle. 

Everything tastes better when someone else makes it, Smitty&#39;s is the perfect example of this. I could make a turkey sandwich at home with mayo, guac, lettuce and tomato, but I would so much rather pay for it. It tastes much better when the professional sandwich makers at Smitty&#39;s make it."

Specials everyday, which were all amazing. I especially love the freshness and taste of their bread -  they get it from a local breadsmith in St. Charles.

Sadly I don&#39;t work in St. Charles anymore, and it is quite a ways from my house, so I don&#39;t eat it as often as I would like. However, Smitty&#39;s still haunts me cause it&#39;s so good, if only I could drive there on my lunch now.."

The line was long, but went very fast.  The bread is fresh from Breadsmith and IMHO a sandwich is only as good as its bread - the cracked wheat we had was fantastic!  We both split the turkey berry and the tuna fish sandwiches (substituting out the croissant).  

I have to say the tuna was fine but not exceptional - though I personally prefer my bread toasted for tuna fish and I usually like a little crunch which was missing.

The turkey berry was absolutely fantastic! I will be returning for this sandwich, especially since it is so convenient to grab and enjoy a nice picnic along the river.  Excellent proportion between all the ingredients - including the bread.

The staff was very friendly and efficient and we were lucky to get the table in the window.

This will now be one of my go to spots."

In a world (okay in the Tri-cities) where the only places you can find a &#34;real&#34; sandwich are Panera and Corner Bakery (freshly made with 800 heavy greasy calories), Smitty&#39;s should practically be sainted. 

Unless you make your own sandwiches at home, there is no other place to have a fresh, simple sandwich. That said, there are options on the menu at Smitty&#39;s that are catered to the &#34;million-ingredient&#39; people, and sometimes that really does make a delicious sandwich. But what I love most is that they let you make it your own way! 

You can have one of their pre-determined sandwiches, the Annika, the Turkey Berry, or the Groucho (a grilled panini for my meat lovin&#39; man) are all good choices. Breads are soft, fresh and make you remember what real food tastes like. 

Its too bad I don&#39;t work  downtown STC because this would be the &#34;oh DARN I forgot to make my lunch today&#34; spot that would make me NOT want to make my lunch at home anymore."

The up sides were; wasn&#39;t too busy, lots of seating, fast service and very casual. Plus they were showing college football on the one TV. The menu offers a wide variety of sandwiches from grilled to cold to Panini&#39;s. They also have a lot of different soda selections in bottles, like flavored cream soda and root beer. I ordered a panini that was &#34;muffalatta&#34; style and it was good. The bread smith focaccia was flaky and delicious , but not firm enough to hold all the sandwich had so it got kind of digger toward the end. But it was still good. My boyfriend ordered the California Turkey which was the main reason for my three star review. It tasted like a plain turkey sandwich you could make at home, the bread was soft and ingredients fresh but just not Great like we expected. Another disappointing factor that contributed to the 3 starts is the lack of hot peppers and hot sauce, hey only had jalapeños and that&#39;s disappointing for a sandwich place. We will probably be back and try something else, but for a sandwich lover like me it wasn&#39;t THAT impressive like the earlier reviews state."

The homemade soups that I&#39;ve had (Broccoli and cheddar-YUM and French onion-I wish there was cheese on top) were pretty delightful. The sandwiches on the Breadsmith bread are made to order for customer satisfaction. I once made the mistake of forgetting to off the mayo--bleck.

 The Cali Club (sans mayo) is awesome. The dill veggie croissant is pretty good. I had the traditional sub sandwich yesterday for lunch and man-o-man was the inside good. The bread, unfortunately was a little less than fresh :( This was my first occurrence with this issue, and it&#39;s likely not a regular one. But for a while, I&#39;ll be steering away from the french roll.

Do try their chicken pesto panini.. I loved it."

It is interesting that the meaning of Omega is the end as this will likely be the last time I come to Omega. This place has always had a place in my heart when I think of dining. I first went to the location in Niles Illinois which was a great supper restaurant. Their meals would always include a wonderful breadbasket, a hearty soup, a menu that had many items that changed daily, and a dessert. I recently came back here for lunch and found it a little bit disappointing. It will a lot of the desserts had changed there was no longer the strawberry cheesecake but a lot of different pies and premade. The breadbasket was still nice however what was missing was the long crackers and other type of fresh pastries. Don&#39;t get me wrong the price is very cheap for the food you get. I ordered a Philly steak sandwich and I&#39;m not exactly sure what I got. It came out on a garlic bread roll which gave it a very weird taste. In addition the Philly steak was not sliced well, it was very chewy and difficulty eating.I usually look forward to the soup which was a beef and barley soup however it was so salty that it was barely edible. The server was still nice sort of like the old diner charm however it did not make up for the type of food they served. I don&#39;t think I will be back based on this eating experience any longer

Pros: Low price, traditional diner experience, and you can make your meal a complete meal including dessert and coffee for an additional fee

Cons: The food is no longer good in my opinion

Hidden deals:
They have a menu that changes every day with the menu insert. There&#39;s also daily specials"

The busboys kept asking to take our dishes away while we were still eating. We tried to explain that they came to our table over 8 times in a 5 minute period. It really upset my wife to the point she got up and left.The manager&#39;s response was not at all comforting.  He said it&#39;s hard to get good help. I left thinking they are not going to fix this. Even the waitress said the busboys should be assigned to certain tables and not have each one (5 of them) pollenating each table over and over.

I will not return. An upsetting experience.

BTW, I was really happy to find a single piece of clam in my bowl of clam chowder. Whippy!! I thought by mistake they gave me cream of potato soup.  Honesty, I don&#39;t know how they get away with it. Sorry I didn&#39;t save the piece of clam for the cook to reuse it."

Not nice at all.  Very poor food and we had an issue and now we will not go back.   I do not feel like they cared if we come back.  so I bid this place farewell!

We will not be going back here after coming here over 30 years!

We came in with a groupon and some in front of me standing in line hit my hand by accident and the groupon was marked redeem.  Did Omega do anything to try to help us?  No one thing some kind person google the corp office of Groupon.  Omega stool and stared at us like we were criminals!  I said we will never come back to Omega ever again!  They did not care.

What would have been the right way to handled this is to take us aside, help us call groupon and assisted us in a professional manor!  Of course that didn&#39;t happen!  This is very sad because I have been coming here since I was a kid!  Poor customer service wins."

Their Ranch and Garlic Dressings are to die for! I want the recipes! YuM!!! And, oh my goodness, if you ever visit on a Wednesday or Sunday, don&#39;t pass up on taking home a Quart of their Cream of Chicken with rice soup!!! It is DELICIOUS!!! Add a little lemon to it for a little zest or kick to it. Try it once, and you&#39;ll probably do the same the next time too. We wish Omega was open 24 hours like it used to be back in the day... However, we understand everybody needs a little sleep sometimes. No wonder they are so consistent there. GOOD Customer service and GREAT FOOD is why my family and I keep coming back for more!

Breakfasts here are excellent especially.  Omelet skillets with vegetables, hash browns, pancakes and or toasts will leave you full with food still left over.  Very good place. 

Everything is clean and the wait staff is great.  The hostess seems to remember everyone and is always social with the crowd. Also some of the best coffee I have ever tasted.  Can&#39;t go wrong with this place.  Pancakes have excellent flavor and they can substitute hash browns for fruit if you&#39;re trying to decrease your carb intake.

Only negative is the price of their glass of orange juice.  Wish it was a little cheaper.  

Overall, highly recommend."

I can&#39;t remember anything about that meal. Oh well. I did come here last week for dinner, though. We only came here because they were having a fundraising night for the school I work at: 50% of the bill (before taxes) would be donated to the school PTA. Since I live so close, I figured... why not?

We were pleasantly surprised at the large bread basket they placed on the table. I love bread. I eat too much bread. I ate too much bread here. The bread was good!

My husband ordered a burger and I ordered a veggie melt sandwich. Both came with soup. I had the french onion soup since the two other soups had meat in them. I&#39;m not really a fan of french onion. This one was good. I think. I&#39;ve never had it before so I wasn&#39;t sure what to compare it to, but it&#39;s definitely not a soup I&#39;d pick in the future if I have other options.

When my meal arrived, I was shocked at how large it was and how it wasn&#39;t a sandwich at all. The two slices of bread were side by side with large amounts of avocado and cheese draped over them. If you need to know something about me and food, I just CANNOT stand the sight of mounds of white, melted cheese draped over food. I was already repulsed. And the slices simply could not be put together as a sandwich. Disappointed, I cut a piece of the bread off anyway and tried it. YE-UCK! The Swiss cheese on top was mixed with Cesar dressing -- two of my not-so-preferred options mixed together just made me want to puke. I couldn&#39;t eat this.

When the waitress came back, I told her, &#34;Um... I don&#39;t really like this. At all.&#34; She promptly went to speak to a manager, came back, grabbed my plate, and told me I could order something else off the menu. OK, cool. I ordered an entree with breaded fish and a side of veggies. This meal came after my husband already finished his, but the fish was good! The veggies were OK -- I took them home. They&#39;re actually still sitting in my fridge. Oops! Our bill was about $25. Our waitress was really sweet and gracious throughout the whole meal(s) and we were thankful for that, too.

I have no desire to come back here simply because it just isn&#39;t my scene and I prefer other spots for breakfast and dinner. However, I was really impressed with their customer service and the prices weren&#39;t too bad. I can understand why people like to come here."

But it had been a long time since my last visit.  The short summary is that Omega is an exceptional &#34;greasy spoon&#34; type restaurant with a typical menu adequately prepared. But on top of that they do have a very nice selection of baked goods for dessert.   The portion size almost guarantees that you will be taking food home with you. The other thing that sets them apart is the service. The service lifts this 3-star restaurant up to 4 stars. 

I went to lunch with about 9 other people right at noon.  Reservations had been made in advance and the staff was ready for us. The group kind of trickled in. As each person arrived he or she was promptly greeted and a drink order taken and delivered. Other places I have eaten would not even have seated such a group until all parties were present. 

One of the ladies expressed an interest in the fried chicken. As this takes longer to prepare than other dishes, the waitress wisely polled the others in the group to see who else might be ordering the chicken.  She then passed word to the kitchen before taking the remaining orders. This resulted in all the food arriving at the sane time with no long wait. 

With the exception of the chicken, which smelled phenomenal, the food was ordinary, but plentiful and attractively presented.  There were some comments about the temperature of some of the hot dishes, including the tepid soup that I personally ordered. But everything was edible and nobody was vocally upset with their meal. 

I will be ordering that chicken on my next visit!"

The food looked delicious and there was a lot however when I began eating it, the taste was overwhelming that these folks cook with rancid oil.  They do not change their oil often enough.  The eggs and hash browns were dripping with this old cooking oil.

I really wanted to like Omega House.  The people seem nice.  They heaped a lot of food into the breakfast skillet (enough for 3 people).  The service was fast and cost a lot cheaper than The Egg Basket however, these folks need to change whatever grease they are using, it&#39;s old.  I would rather pay extra for them changing their cooking grease / oil more.  I ended up giving this to our dog and I&#39;m not a picky eater.

I don&#39;t honestly know what grease or oil they are cooking with but it ruined their food, twice.  Yes the food looked appetizing, fresh, arranged nicely but again, use old, rancid cooking oil and it will ruin the flavor.

I wonder if they are also using lard because it&#39;s cheap.  When I do my eggs and hash browns at home, I simply use the Pam Spray or a tiny bit of FRESH Olive Oil."

We chose Omega since we both haven&#39;t been to it and have been wanting to try it for some time.  We get there get a seat immediately and order fairly quickly as well.  The only thing that was good was the waitress and the pickle.  

I ordered a Malibu panini that had Turkey, bacon, avocado, and cheese.  The turkey was of a Grey coloring and had a horrible texture.   Overall the sandwich was pretty horrible.  The fries were mushy and super store bought.  My boyfriend&#39;s hashbrowns were soggy and the omelet was of a weird texture and had a huge ball of cheese randomly placed.  We both love cheese but don&#39;t stick balls of cheese in our mouths for a reason;  because it&#39;s unpleasant.  

When I went to pay the woman she asked how it was, I said &#34;honestly not that good&#34;. I hardly ever complain when I&#39;m buying food because I used to work in the food industry and it&#39;s a tough business.

Went here around July/August 2014 and the place is much smaller than the location by Golf Mill Mall. 

Walked in and was told to give them 5 minutes. Turned around and within a minute was able to get seated. BONUS

Service was not great as the lady seemed to be too overwhelmed. She seems like she wanted to help the &#39;older&#39; tables first rather than a table with 2 kids (10 &amp; 14 yro) I had to ask for drinks as no one came to just give it to us.

I haven&#39;t been there since I was little so I figured I&#39;d give it another try.  My co-workers and I were craving a breakfast for lunch type of thing and Omega is only a couple blocks away from our office so we decided to order from there.  The takeout was super fast.  We had three meals and they said it&#39;d be about 15 minutes and it was ready promptly at the 15 minute mark.  

My co-worker order the turkey island melt which I was also debating on getting, she said the bread was horrible, it looked like a soggy mess, but everything else was okay.  I ordered the Delicate Suzette Crepes French Toasty that was covered in strawberries and an orange sauce.  They were just okay.  There was a large amount for what you pay but nothing special.  I don&#39;t know if its because my sister spoils me with amazingly delicious crepes or if these were just not that good.  I also ordered hash browns which were abnormally dry and tasteless.  I know potatoes don&#39;t taste like much anyways but these were not good.  I only took a couple bites.  My other coworker seemed to enjoy his food - eggs, toasty, hash browns, and bacon.  I tried the bacon and it was pretty good.  

Overall, I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go to Omega - there&#39;s a breakfast place on the same street that&#39;s better.  But, I would eat from here again if we ordered.  Definitely would try something different.

Oh it was a little on the pricy side as well for a breakfast type place."

Not a big deal but with a packed house and a wait, I would expect something a little better. 2) they put us in a table that basically blocks access to restrooms so people were bumping me try to get past. 3) Then they moved our table to make more room, but in doing so jerked the table into my daughter&#39;s fingers making her scream. Slow the hell down and try communicating with patrons. 4) coffee is still empty. Has been for 10+ minutes. 5) asked for water. Never got it. 6) wife orders coke 3-4 times before they finally brought it. 

All in all never coming back. Don&#39;t even care what the food tastes like when it arrives.

As an update, once we got the food, the pancakes were okay. Eggs were eggs, hash browns kind of clumpy. The ham was good though. I never got silverware. I had to take it from another table. Some silverware was dirty. Basically, you have other choices. This super crowded place was on par with Denny&#39;s."

Most of the time it is breakfast. Experience for this is pretty good. Decent food. Good service, prices are fine. I like the omlettes or skillets. The pancakes are good too. Avoid the bread basket, because who knows what the previous customers have done to it? Waitresses here are very good. Even the busboys have stepped up and refilled coffee or water.

However, on my last visit, my wife and I went in for dinner. The manager was on the phone by the entrance. We stood there, waiting to be seated, while he was talking and talking. He didnt acknowledge us (not a good start). Finally, we were about to be seated. They had closed the back area off. There was a larger group with a noisy child. Because of this, we asked him if we could be seated in the first booth on the other side. He explained that it was closed. My wife asked me &#34;do you want to go somewhere else?&#34; (loud enough for him to hear) and I said &#34;yea, I dont want to sit near that noise.&#34; (he heard this, too)

 To my surprise, we left without the manager saying or doing anything to keep us. I have not been back since.

In their service industry, customers are your life blood. (and we&#39;re always right)  If you can keep us there by responding to a reasonable request (or explaining why you can&#39;t) you should do so."

The last 2 years however, something has been &#34;off&#34;. The soup is no longer good. :( it is either over salted or almost tasteless. The Sunday cream of chicken with rice is terrible. Almost no chicken flavor and is an odd off white color. It tasted like white sauce with rice. The fries tasted like they were cooked in old stale oil. There is also a strong odor of &#34;perfume&#34; and old spice in the air.....which my son noticed right when we walked in. 
I&#39;ve only been here twice in the last 2 years and both times were awful. Crossing it off my list and I&#39;m looking for another local place with good soup!"

Janie is still our favorite waitress - she just gets it.  Prompt, kind and even a little funny.  She just makes the meal so much more enjoyable when we get her.

The soups are much better than I remember from a couple years ago.  We have been going more often again and between the good, hearty soups, the fresh bread basket and the good service.  This is a good spot for a quick and casual meal.  

I&#39;ve broadened my horizons a bit and have found that I like the Grecian Chicken Breast...hash browns instead of rice please. The rice pudding is good.  The breakfast options always hit the spot.  It&#39;s not a fancy place, but fits the bill when we are looking for a reasonable dinner option that delivers on decent food."

So, you would expect to see:

*Old pastries set behind glass cases to convince you they are worth something (NOT!)

*Baskets of bread that look ancient

*A balloon machine

*Disgusting gumball machine and crusty mint/lollypop tray

*March of Dimes quarter collection

*Outdated plastic-covered booths

CHECK!  We have a winner here!

But, what you also get is: 

*no b/s service!

*Good, fresh salads (they are made to order)

* Well-cooked omlettes (although they are on the bit greasy side)

For the reviewers who actually ordered steak at this place AND are complaining---SERIOUSLY?  Go to a steak restaurant if you want a steak and order what these folk do best: Breakfast.

As soon as they realized that people loved their soup and would take it home in quarts, they DOUBLED the price.  So, we just don&#39;t go that often anymore.

Today I went to lunch there with my daughter because we both had a taste for soup.  The server brought me a bowl of chicken shell soup.  1/2 way through my bowl I felt something sharp and pretty big in my mouth, (thought I broke a tooth!!!) and spit it out to find a CHICKEN BONE!!!  YIKES.

I brought it to the attention of the server and could tell that she went to tell the owners but they had no intention of doing anything about it.

When I went to pay the bill, the owner asked if everything was O.K. I told her all but the chicken bone I found in my soup.  She said (unsympathetic) &#34;did she bring you another one?&#34;. I said, &#34;NO, I wouldn&#39;t want another one!!!&#34;  If one bowl has a bone in the same batch, wouldn&#39;t they all????? She just kind of pretended like I didn&#39;t say anything at all, took my money and we were on our way.

Funny thing is,,,on my way in I saw a &#34;YELP likes us&#34; sticker posted on their door!!  LOL

She could have at least PRETENDED like she cared as she took my money!!

Will NOT go there again and would not suggest it to anyone either:("

We arrived at 10:45 and the restaurant was busy as usual. I&#39;ve eaten here on plenty of weekend mornings so this was not a surprise. We were seated within a totally acceptable timeframe and promptly placed our orders. The waitress was very nice and as responsive as she could be with the number of tables she had. After about 45 minutes, we flagged her down as we hadn&#39;t received our meals. She advised the kitchen did not make one of the four meals that were ordered and the chef was fighting with her about it. Shortly thereafter, 3 of the 4 meals arrived. They were cold. The waitress then delivered the 4th meal and we advised the other meals were cold. She apologized and said she could reheat them. We declined as we had to be somewhere shortly. She advised she would send the manager over. Rita, the manager, then comes over to the table. She first blames the waitress for the issues with our food. As this point, we don&#39;t care what the reason is and a manger pushing blame seems ridiculous. She then mildly apologizes as she walks away saying &#34;I&#39;ll give you a discount&#34;. Her response was incredibly disappointing. Regardless of the reason, it seems inappropriate for the manager to put blame on someone else. I&#39;ve worked in the service industry. A manager apologizing and attempting to make some form of amends is all that is required. She then applied a $5 discount for the cold meals. Uh, thanks for nothing Rita. I would have rated Omega one star had I not had great experiences prior to our visit this past Saturday."

Like others reviews, food is fine, some things are better than others--hubby had the strip steak and eggs--flavor was awesome, I had the NY strip and eggs---that was alright, kinda bland--nothing a little cholula hot sauce can&#39;t help!-service was good but on the slow side.  They do have a huge variety of foods and lots of desserts.

I have been coming here for a long time and as of recently, they have really been slacking. I actually have their number saved in my cell so I can call ahead and check on the soups for that day. Yes, I base my decision as to whether to go their or not, on the soup. I&#39;m a picky PITA that way.  The soup lately has been lacking. Normally, its overflowing with delectable veggies and nice chucks of beef or chicken (depending on the soup) and over the past few months, the soup has just been unsatisfying. The bread has a tenancy to be old. I should really find out what day they get their bread and head over that day. Their cream of chicken soup never really has disappointed me except that sometimes the amount of chicken is lacking.

The food is always pretty good. I typically order the Grecian chicken breast with rice pilaf and veggies with my bowl of soup. The chicken is always perfect- no joke. They got that down to a science. The rice is fine but the veggies are always soggy and mushy no matter what time of day it is. [as I write this, I&#39;m wondering why we still go here????]. My boyfriend orders the Chicken stir fry- I know...I don&#39;t know why, but it&#39;s actually pretty good and the veggies are much better than what comes on my plate.

You get a free dessert with most dinner entrees and their desserts are pretty decent. German Chocolate Cake is our favorite. We&#39;ll be back, but, like I said, I don&#39;t know why. :)"

It&#39;s also usually hangover breakfast, which means lots and lots of grease. 

I&#39;ve never had anything other than breakfast at Omega. Is it anything to brag about? Not so much. The food is your average diner fare. It&#39;s not fabulous...but it&#39;s not like eating cafeteria food either. I usually go for the two egg chicken coop which consists of two eggs ((as you like them)) with bacon//sausage//ham, potatoes, and toast. If you so desire, two buttermilk pancakes may be substituted for toast or potatoes. I always go for the pancakes ((best to sop up an alcohol belly)). And all this for about $6.50. Nice and cheap! 

Service is, you know, standard diner service. I like to put it as &#34;it is what it is&#34;. The servers don&#39;t love their jobs and they sometimes dish out more than just food ((like &#39;tudes)). And you typically have to have your water refilled. However, service is usually quite fast which is a plus.

Overall, it&#39;s not the greatest breakfast spot in the Schaumburg area, but in a pinch ((or with a hangover)) Omega does the job."

Let me just drop my car off and eat my sleep-deprived feelings away.

Their breakfast is unbelievable and generously portioned. My fave? The Hobo Skillet w/eggs over-easy (don&#39;t knock it, til you try it). Their daily specials are also fabulous, so if you are unsure what to get, don&#39;t hesitate to refer to those.

Its only down-side is that it gets pretty busy, so if you are hungry, have some extra pieces of bread and butter while you wait. I&#39;m not going to lie, though, I can&#39;t wait to get my oil changed in a month."

omelettes, pancakes, the Buffalo Chicken wrap, and
Broiled Whitefish, which were outstanding.

Coffee is always good and being refilled by a friendly staff--

Bugs in the salad, OK as disgusting as that sounds, it is really understandable. Being given a bread basket with a piece of bread already bitten. Hmm, still didn&#39;t complain since mistakes do happen, but on my last visit, this was definitely the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. Had my heart set on potato pancakes, and they had a special, so definitely was excited to order my favorite. Normally I enjoy the potato pancakes, but on this occasion, I am disgusted and in pure shock at the decline of quality and service of this once great restaurant. While on my second bite, I bit into a metal string. Yes, a metal, not plastic string. I cannot put into words exactly what my thoughts were at that moment. My friend called over the waitress who wanted to take away the plate but i requested a manager. Although our waitress was very apologetic, the service from her was great I cannot say the same about whoever the supposedly new manager was. Yes he apologized, yes he explained what the metal piece is, which by the way is a scrubber to clean the grill with. He said he&#39;d take it off the bill and walked away. Our waitress came back to our table and was very apologetic and offered me something else, of course i declined. than again offered an apology and said the whole meal was on them. Okay great, but was it her responsibility or the manager to apologize, offer something else or tell us our meal was on them? i cannot or will not in my right mind come back here again or even recommend it to anyone."

Our friends had been here before but this was our first time.  We were seated very quickly and our waitress came over very quickly to take our drink orders even though the place was pretty busy.  We looked over the menu and the specials for the night and two of us decided on the Pork Tenderloin specials, and the other two got the Roast Leg of Lamb.  Our waitress, who looked like she&#39;s been at this for a long while, was an absolute doll!  She absolutely knew how to take care of her customers.  I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t catch her name.  Our food came out, and our waitress brought the sauce for the Leg of Lamb on the side, saying that not everyone likes it on the meat.  Thank God she did that!  The leg of lamb was excellent, very tender and well flavored, but the sauce had absolutely no taste at all of any kind and was overly salty!  The Pork Tenderloin was breaded, which was not in the menu description, and again overly salty.  The dinners came with soups and deserts.  I had the carrot cake which was huge and very good, all the others had spumoni ice cream which was....well ice cream.  The food, meaning soups and entree&#39;s could use much less salt.  I felt like the cook was trying to sabotage the owner&#39;s business by over salting everything.  If you go there, ask for no salt on your entree&#39;s and you might luck out.

This place deserves 5 stars for our waitress and 3 stars for our food due to the saltiness of the food.  I gained 2-1/2 pounds overnight...yep water retention due to salt!  Try it once and tell them to ease off on the salt and see if it works.  We will give them another try and ask them to take it easy on the salt."

When our meals came everything seemed fine, however after I took a bite of my hash browns my husband pointed out there was a piece of metal in my hash browns. I pointed it out to the waitress who told the owner. A younger man came over and said he was sorry told us it was a tooth from the brush they use to clean the grill. Well, ok. After that my appetite was completely gone and I barely touched my food. When the check came the owner had take the hashbrowns off the bill. A whopping $1.37. I&#39;ve worked in food service before, you comp the whole meal. That being said, if you eat here watch out for the metal shards you may find in your food! We will NEVER be returning."

There&#39;s a variety of food here that are averagely priced. Good portions, I might add. I had the crepes with strawberries with a side of Canadian bacon. My husband had steak and eggs, with a side of pancake and hash browns. He devoured everything except for the pancake. I took home half of my order plus the pancake. We were stuffed.

On our way out while my hubby was paying, I noticed there were sweets displayed by the entrance. They had quite a variety of sweets, but since there was baklava, I decided to order two slices to take home. After the lady placed each of the baklavas in two small plastic containers, one of the containers fell &amp; I noticed the slices were smaller than the usual slices I normally get from other bakeries. I was ticked that the lady didn&#39;t place the 2 containers in a bag in the first place. To top it off, when I was ready to pay for them, the guy informs me that the charge for the two slices was $7.22. I couldn&#39;t believe they charged $3+ for a small slice of baklava! I had to repeat the price he mentioned and the guy asked me if I ever had baklava before. Like I haven&#39;t had one before. Note to self: Go to Caputo&#39;s on Lake St. next time I have a taste for baklava. I can get four big slices for the price I&#39;m getting charged here.

I would recommend Omega based on the breakfast we had. We will have to try their lunch and dinner next time, but will have to skip the dessert display, which I think is just overpriced."

Lunch and dinner... not so good. Yesterday, we ordered breakfast to go. It was good... I say just good. I had the jr. apple pancake. Which took 45 mins to cook. No big deal. However, not really worth the wait. Not sure it was because we order take out..or what? It just was not that good. The crust was soft and mushy, and just fell apart. the inside, was jammed packed with apples and filling- not fully cooked. I usually order a skillet,  which is always really good. I think I will just stick with that in the future. They are reasonably priced, and overall, very good service.  When you dine in, they do give you fresh bread, muffin basket. It&#39;s always been very good. Sunday&#39;s usually are very busy. So there will be a very long line. Overall, very worth the wait."

It was served with a large basket of bread rolls. Loved the bread rolls. We split a turkey club sandwich and fires. The turkey was sliced thick the way I like it.  Our server was very efficient and friendly. I know they hate it when people split meals because it means less of a tip. But she was very nice. We tipped extra.

  Things we didn&#39;t enjoy were the desserts.  We took some to go to enjoy later and they tasted store made, stale, and unappetizing.  I was ready to break my diet for a big piece of chocolatey cake and I was dissapointed.  sigh- probably for the best. :)  Also, the bartender ran out of some things and tried to pass off other things in our drinks.

However, the last couple of times there have been disappointing but this last time is really going to be the last time. We went for lunch and I ordered a turkey clubhouse sandwich. Quite honestly not the best clubhouse sandwich that I have ever eaten. Bread tasted old, bacon odd and turkey processed. Husband ordered a Reuben sandwich. Now very possible it said open faced on the menu and hubby didn&#39;t notice that. This was a plate of well I can&#39;t really properly describe it because it was so strange looking for a Reuben sandwich. The corned beef was not thinly sliced at all. It actually looked like hunks of corned beef it was so thick. So now I am thinking well if it tastes OK so what? When I noticed my husband struggling to eat this I leaned over and took a piece of the corned beef. It tasted terrible and I told him this tastes sour to me. I didn&#39;t like the smell of it either.

We put our trust in the extremely knowledgeable wait staff, and ordered the Large Charcuterie board. The chef chose the meats and cheeses including a super farmhousey blue, truffle cheese, lamb face, and smoked duck.  The duck was like meat sashimi, barely cooked but buttery and delicate. 

The restaurant concept, design and menu is straight out of northern California or Eugene Oregon. My group was so excited at the unique offerings and we plan on going back next week for a smoke duck dinner, elk, and the newly released beers.

It just sat there, getting cold, as we tried to locate someone to tell them it wasn&#39;t ours.

Some of the dishes I had felt like they had too many flavors going on at once and then others did not have enough. I know they&#39;ll find their happy medium eventually. I&#39;m curious to go back in a few months and see how things have changed.

Since they make their own beer, I decided to give that a try. I think I&#39;d pass on the beer next time and just do cocktails. I tried 4 different ones and I wasn&#39;t a fan of any of them.

We&#39;ve been fans of the Turf Room for a long time and have been dying for Hardware to open. We finally made our way over this weekend.

The wow factor for this restaurant is the facility itself. A wall with greens growing on it? Yes! Herbs growing in the outdoor patio area - yes! It&#39;s a gorgeous place. 

The service was very good. The servers are passionate about the concept and they&#39;re knowledgeable. They&#39;re attentive and not obnoxious. They know the menu. Clearly, Hardware has spent time on training the front of the house.

What keeps me from giving a 4 or 5 star review is the food. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the food is interesting and diverse. What it is lacking is flavor. We had pig face Terrine and it was, quite frankly, bland. If you&#39;ve been to Girl and The Goat, Pigface is out of this world. Hardware can do better. 

We also had goat cheese and it was wonderful. Korean Pork Belly was good, but it can be better. Once again, flavors. One item we ate that had pretty good flavors was the cauliflower dish. We also had foie gras sausage with lentils. It was just &#34;okay&#34;.

I&#39;m eager to get back to Hardware and try the cocktails and some BBQ.

The food really is great. Loved the fois gras. Would skip the ricotta dumplings. Shared 3 appetizers and a salad; they recommend plates to share. Loved that approach. You end up tasting a lot of different flavors. Looked at the most beautiful desserts going by, we were just too full for dessert. 

The atmosphere is wonderful and service was terrific--helpful and enthusiastic. They specialize in whiskey and beers, so the mixed drinks are mostly whiskey-based. The beers are either local to Illinois or brewed there. My husband loved their porter.

Being die-hard fans of The Turf Room since they opened, we heard about the concept early on and watched the building grow out of the corn fields when we&#39;d pass by.

The outdoor patio was really packed when we arrived, and it was cool to see the herbs and hops and fruit trees growing around the property.  I love fresh figs, grew up in a house that had a fig tree in the back yard, and I was delighted to see all of the immature figs growing by the entrance in front of an entire wall of greens.  We opted to sit inside, however, since it was still pretty humid from all of the recent rain.

The bar is gorgeous, the dining room smallish, and it was fascinating to see the owner in the attached greenhouse, working on planting rows and rows of house greens. The low ceilings made the rooms pretty loud, so loud that it was hard to hear our server when he came up to introduce himself.  

Drink orders were placed, rum and DC for the lady, though no Bacardi to be had here, she settled on a Taildragger Dark rum that was delicious with immediate molasses notes but packed a punch.  I was happy to see a Sazerac as one of the featured cocktails, and as it turns out, it&#39;s one of the bartender&#39;s favorites as well.  It was superb, although it took a rather long time between placing the order and when they arrived.  At least a big wine bottle of water was set down right after we were seated.

Our first food choice was the medium charcuterie board, three meats and three cheese with accompaniments.  It was one of the best boards we&#39;ve had anywhere, with capicola, duck bacon and lamb sausage all house made.  It was hard to hear the names of the cheeses, but they were delicious as well.  We cleaned the board in short order and moved on.

A second round of drinks took a while to appear again, as our server had his hands full with several other tables in the dining room.

Next came the octopus and the pork sausage pancakes.  The octopus was scrumptious, great grilled flavor and very tender, on top of a nice salad of sweet potato, mushrooms and lovely green beans.  The pancakes were good, nice bacony flavor with a blueberry reduction, but something that we might not order again.

That might seem like a lot of food so far, but the small plate sharing concept let us sample a couple more choices to complete our meal.  The Chicago poutine was excellent, a little short on gravy but made up for nicely by the runny fried egg on top.  This was a pretty filling item, and the giardinera that came with it was a nice sharp contrast to the potatoes and cheese curds.  Our final choice was Parker&#39;s Sticky Chicken, the chicken thighs done nice and tender and falling off the bone, but the sticky mango sauce was lacking something, perhaps a little acid note to balance the sweetness.  Maybe the green onion kimchee that came with it needs to ferment a little longer.

Our final bill came to around what we&#39;d normally pay for a full meal at The Turf Room, so we did a nice sampling across the menu.

For a place that&#39;s only been open seven weeks, the food was darn good but the service needs some tweaking.  Each course was paced so that our small table was never overcrowded, but just a touch too slow as there were times when either a drink refill or the next course should have appeared.

No doubt it will get better with time, as did The Turf Room, and we&#39;ll be back to see."

It may force you a bit out of your culinary comfort zone, but the end result is a very satisfying dining experience, served by a pleasant and knowledgeable staff.

Simply Liking this place in my review doesn&#39;t seem sufficient. The five stars is given as reward for being bold &amp; new, with innovative style &amp; an apparent mission to be more than just another pub &amp; grub. Plus we really did enjoy our meal .... In my opinion, I&#39;d be very happy to see more dining options in the suburbs like this, and perhaps fewer Buffalo Wild Wings, mediocre bbq joints, and cookie-cutter generic Olive/Panda/Border places"

Am not a beer drinker but I am a foodie so in I went to eat. Love the concept of the place, sustainability and re-put posing. Had the &#34;hot dog&#34;, baked goat cheese. Was very good. They grow their own greens inside! Big field of hops outside for their beer. Great staff very friendly and accommodating. Best pickles I&#39;ve ever had! I tried a drink I wasn&#39;t sure about and there was no trouble returning it. I look forward to go back to try more."

We were passing by at about 11:30 last Saturday night and decided to check it out.  We had 5 minutes before the kitchen closed, so we ordered the Chicago Poutine appetizer.  It was good.  Large wedge fries, a slice of their housemade bacon, giardiniera, cheese curds, and a fried egg.  There weren&#39;t very many cheese curds on it and the fries were a little too big, but the taste was very good.

My husband got a sample flight of beers.  He was disappointed and said he would just get something else next time.  That&#39;s kind of sad when your house beers are not as good as others on the menu.  I was the DD so just had water.  For a sample flight of 4 beers and the Poutine it was about $18.  I didn&#39;t think it was so bad, but we didn&#39;t have a full meal.

The decor is interesting and, according to the bartender, everything in the place has a story behind it.  The bathrooms are weird, just like the Turf Room.  They are in a small hallway with about 5 doors.  Each door says different things like Rest Room, Janitor&#39;s Closet, Classroom, etc.  They are all individual bathrooms, so don&#39;t wait for the one that actually says Restroom on it.  They also have an area that had sausages hanging and I am assuming you can view them making sausages in the front area.  I would suggest that they keep that area tidy even if it is right before closing.  I went to look at it and someone&#39;s jacket was on the table. There was also a shelf with spices, etc. on it, that was messy looking.

I wouldn&#39;t take my children here.  It&#39;s higher priced and unless you have a foodie kid, they will not be happy with their choices.  The best part of this visit was my receipt. I happened to look at it today and under name it said, Shivan/Dick.  Bwahaha.  My name is Shevon, so close enough.  My husband&#39;s name is Danny....uh, hopefully the bartender just heard him wrong."
hardware-north-aurora-5,Nicole R.,Jwrg76eZGjridhYE_E3EqQ,"North Aurora, IL",0,1,0,7,6,ymoX3yV-EIPEzmnwEasAXA,4.0,2016-09-19,"We went into our dinner a little skeptical. We had heard things like the menu was not great, it was way too expensive, too pretentious and overall was not worth it. We heard that from people we knew and of course Yelp was filled with similar comments. But we went anyway and man I am glad I did. This is not dinner at Chili&#39;s or TGI Fridays. If one goes to Hardware with that sort of expectation, they will definitely regret it. This was more like a dining experience. You need to go into it with no expectations, no time limit, no kids and yeah plan to spend money. Order shared plates and multiple courses. The waitress called it &#34;American Tapas&#34;. It&#39;s a menu designed to encourage ordering a bunch of food to explore. 

We started with a 3 meat chartucherie and we liked most of it but didn&#39;t care for one of the meats (duck bacon...tasted like bologna). Then we shared a greenhouse salad- it was so simple - mixed greens and dressing, but the dressing was so good, I wanted to lick the bowl. We moved on to the baked goat cheese and vegetables which was salty and warm and lovely. My husband is still talking about the olives. Our shared entree was the Wagyu hanger steak. The meat was so tender; you would never believe it was hanger steak. It was packed with flavor and cooked perfectly. We ordered the Ho Hos for dessert and they were awesome - you felt like you were eating a ho-ho but there&#39;s booze and they are way better. We had a few cocktails and contrary to other people&#39;s reviews, we left pleasantly stuffed and perfectly content. 

Yes. The entire idea of this restaurant smacks of Hipster Portland Oregon 2013 Pretention. The locally sourced menu items, the garden out back growing hops, the greenhouse inside growing herbs and vegetables, etc. But it&#39;s surprisingly NOT pretentious once you sit down on the freakishly serene patio. The wait staff is super knowledgeable about the menu but they are wearing khakis and a button down gingham shirt. They look like Gander Mountain models, not fine dining tour guides. The menu does have really fancy words on it, but the ingredients behind those fancy words are tastes and flavors that are very familiar. The entire meal was well executed and well appreciated.

All that said, there are a couple of drawbacks that keep this review from being a 5 star. First, it&#39;s step-sibling restaurant down the street excels at creative, delicious and dangerous cocktails. At Hardware, if you like whiskey - you are set on drinks. They have great cocktails that are handmade and crafted and all that, but they are all whiskey based. For those of us crazy enough to dislike the taste of whiskey, our cocktail choices become soberingly limited. I get it, that&#39;s that their thing - a million whiskeys and all, but at the end of the day it is a tad exclusionary to a person who prefers their cocktail with vodka. 

The other far easier fix for Hardware is the ridiculous bathroom situation. It&#39;s passable at the Turf Room to have unmarked, unisex stalls (passable = some boys are messy in the bathroom, frankly and sometimes sharing with the opposite sex is gross. I am not a priss about it either, boy&#39;s -learn how to aim). But at Hardware, they have gone as far as to mis-label the bathrooms. The stall I ended up with had a sign on it that said &#34;janitor&#39;s closet&#34;. It&#39;s not cute or funny and must give the wait staff migraines because I am sure they are constantly being asked where the bathrooms are. I heard it explained twice while I was using one. As a customer, you don&#39;t really want to ask for a bathroom and I mean, your clientele is spending a good amount of money. Label a bathroom for us, please. 

Otherwise, Keep doing what you are doing."

But then there was the OMG moment. For dessert, they had a pork belly and Luxardo cherry ice cream offering that was OFF THE HOOK. Never had anything as good anywhere. My wife was close to licking the plate at the end it was so tasty. Your mind may say no, but you MUST try it. Easily the best dessert I have ever had and I have a few years of experience."

I should have guessed that by the name. Many of the dishes have an egg (quail or otherwise) added to it, even one of the desserts. Blech! It is also a sharing menu. I hate these. They give you a normal or smaller size meal and charge you more, since you are sharing. We had the charcuterie and chose a goat cheese and capicola (2 or 3 paper thin slices). This dish was fine and definitely paleo except for the 3 medium size crackers. We had the shrimp Caesar salad which just literally lined the bowl and the pieces of lettuce were about 9-12 inches long (another paleo dish). Rolls arrived to our table after the salad that were some kind of after product after creating the beer. The waitress made it sound disgusting. Luckily, they were good, soft and warm as the best thing, I ate there. We had trouble finding an entree that wasn&#39;t steak, pork pancakes, swordfish, mussels or octopus or didn&#39;t have an egg, so we had the sticky chicken with Kimchee. It was ok, but 2 chicken thighs and about 5 cherry tomatoes cut in half is not very much food. We each had a glass of wine and it was over $75 with tip. 
As my girlfriend said, &#34;I can&#39;t keep reading the menu. It&#39;s making me nauseous.&#34; I can&#39;t agree more."

The food was similar to tapa style which pushed me to try unique flavors and foods (duck bacon, all sorts of cheeses and olives.) and it was amazing. 

 The nitro brew and flights were on sight and the food was delicious. The place itself is very cool with burnt wood and these ceiling decors made of pennies. 

I typically stick to things I&#39;m use to and am not necessarily adventurous but this place opened up my world to new things. Check this place out! Great service, great food, and even better drinks.

I&#39;m an ambiance guy so what Hardware has done, both visually and figuratively, is impressive.  The bottom line though, comes down to the food and alcohol.  A friend and I went in to give their craft beers a whirl and thought they were about average.  The regular food menu is frightfully expensive so we went with pre-6pm apps which constituted a half dozen small meat choices (like a hot dog, a slider, pieces of bacon, etc).  We liked the place but with all due respect, pricing is far north of the norm.  When the &#39;newness sticker&#39; wears off I think this place will find business far more challenging if they don&#39;t take a more proactive effort to reduce their food and beer price points.

Let me start by saying I am a picky eater.. not very adventurous.. I love a great steak and baked potato!  Of course I do eat other things.. but I am not a foodie and don&#39;t like anything too weird. 

Last Sunday my husband and I tried Hardware.. I&#39;ve heard its owned by the same people who own Turf Room, which has been our favorite local place since it has opened. I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal at the Turf room..  Walking in we loved the ambiance of Hardware.. But it has a very limited menu of strange items.. I tried a ricotta gnocchi.. bland.. mock risotto.. even more bland.. with a side of smoked bacon.. no flavor.. husband commented first bacon he would ever think to add salt too ! His  choices didn&#39;t fair much better..  Hoping for a good dessert.. couldn&#39;t find anything that looked appealing.. chocolate salami.. I don&#39;t think so!!! We walked away hungry with a 78$ bill. ( included 2 drinks pp) Overall a  very disappointing experience, that we chalked up to be unsophisticated in our food tastes! 

Fast forward 5 days... Had plans to go to the Goodman to see War Paint with 3 girlfriends, one suggested a restaurant that was booked.. I looked for nearby alternatives.. only briefly checking reviews.. not bothering  to check the menu when choosing .  Arriving there, very hungry! I panicked when I saw another somewhat limited menu with unusual items!!  WELL.. have to say this farm to table restaurant  is one of the best meals I&#39;ve ever had...that isn&#39;t a big steak! 

All items the four of us chose were excellent..  Peach Caprese Salad, Squash Blossoms, Monkey Bread , bacon popcorn, .The others chose a few beet dishes I did not partake in and a green tomato BLT they said were  excellent. I had the mac and cheese that was to die for!!! Two had the corn chowder that  they raved about. Everything was very flavorful and absolutely Delicious. We certainly didn&#39;t walk away hungry!!  

 I really hate to give poor reviews to local places.. but I think Hardware can do better..Had I not stumbled on the  Chicago restaurant , I most likely would never have tried another similar restaurant.. Hope they can find dishes that blend well together!"

Cool concept and cool design of building with re-purposed materials, eco-friendly operations etc. However.....The food portions were tiny and without much flavor. My party and I literally went to McDonald&#39;s afterward because we were still hungry. Foie Gras on the menu?? Really??? The restaurant is sending mixed messages with this menu option. 
I love the Turf Room, so the owner must know what he is doing. But I&#39;m afraid unless the menu selection changes, portions change and flavoring, I think it&#39;s going to have a hard time covering their operating costs."

This place is definitely different. Stopped here for lunch for the first time and was not disappointed. The ambiance was great and the food selections were unique. I had the duck sandwich and their in house brewed pale ale that was very tasty. They offer a wide selection of locally brewed beer as well as their own and a very extensive whisky list of top shelf bourbon, rye, scotch and vodka from all over the world. They also have an interesting cocktail menu that includes a Sazerac which is very hard to find in this area. If you are looking for a burger and a Bud, this is not your place. But if you are willing to expand your tastes definitely give it a try."
hardware-north-aurora-5,Dan S.,81fr37MM4GR62S2yvOt3gA,"North Aurora, IL",0,1,0,7,12,Ltcgj3cBc3GHkltTBbJjtQ,3.0,2016-07-04,"Read all the prior reviews and decided it&#39;s mixed so let&#39;s see what WE think. Went here with friends after wanting to check it out since it opened since we love trying new places and their premise of all local/self-sustaining. 

We had reservations at 5 and the place was just starting to get busy.  We love the interior decor of the place and the outdoor dining area. Inside is fairly dark but the tables seemed to be a bit too close. We opted to sit outside since it was a nice night out. We were seated immediately and service then, and throughout the night, was very friendly, knowledgeable, etc.   Everybody working seemed very nice, helpful, etc. 

Their drink menu is very extensive with TONS of whiskeys and a decent beer selection, but all was a bit overpriced. $9 for a beer??? C&#39;mon now. Yes, it&#39;s not Miller Lite but I am also not at a concert or ballgame, which is still robbery. Their mixed rinks were very  tasty but overpriced  as well. 

As far as the food, our waiter  told us their menu is made for sharing. There is definitely some sticker shock on a large portion of their menu to me.   We all ordered appetizers and entrees, expecting  large portions or a tapas style presentation. For appetizers, we ordered the hot dog, poutine, spare ribs and salmon carpaccio. The hot dog was outstanding, bigger than a normal hot dog but could&#39;ve been hotter. Still not sure how one &#39;shares&#39; a hot dog 4 ways. The carpaccio was 4 very thin slices about 3&#34; long each. Good, but nothing special. We were expecting more pieces and it to be thicker.  The short ribs were tasty but you only get 2. Some more meat on the ribs would&#39;ve been nice. The poutine wasn&#39;t very poutine-y at all. Just a few big, fried potato wedges with fried egg. The fries were okay, but I was expecting more accoutrements and seasoning. 

For entrees, we got the sticky chicken, wagyu skirt steak, Korean rice and pot pie. The sticky chicken was very good, crunchy, etc.  I didn&#39;t want to share!  I would&#39;ve preferred it being boneless to make it easier to share.  The steak was cooked the way we had requested and also very good, but $27 for 6-7 oz of skirt steak is ridiculous. The pot pie was huge and had an excellent light flaky crust but below the crust, it was  more chicken soup than chicken stew/pot pie. Disappointing to say the least. The soup underneath tasted okay for what it&#39;s worth. The Korean rice was tasty but lacked seasoning. All the entrees could&#39;ve come out hotter as well.

As far as desserts, we had the HoHo&#39;a and strawberry shortcake. Both   were very good but the HoHo&#39;a were better. We asked for the check. 
Definitely some sticker shock and disappointment. For our $250+, I expected a lot more and better seasoned food.  Tough to leave a place dropping $125+ and still feel hungry.

All in all, the food was good to very good. Nothing   blew any of us  away though, which should be expected  given those prices. Most could&#39;ve used some seasoning, come out hotter and in bigger portions...and  lower the prices at least 25%.  This is North Aurora, not Barrington or Chicago.  The portion sizes are not really shareable at all, unless you are only there with one other person and they don&#39;t eat much.   We really liked the decor, ambience and service. The food was good, don&#39;t get me wrong  and we did have a nice night but at those prices...AND  to still walk away hungry afterwards and not be singing praises, there  are better values and meals in the area."

We decided to make a dinner date with our good friends and we returned to Hardware for dinner.  We decided to use Uber since we knew that Hardware had great bartenders and a great drink menu.  Our 2nd visit did not disappoint.  Not only great drinks, but great food!  The ladies enjoyed the Kentucky Daquiri and &#34;The Last Word&#34; and they loved them .  For the second round, they both went with &#34; The Last Word&#34;. The men enjoyed the homemade beer for the evening. 
For dinner, we shared a few small plates: (1) a charcuterie with a few meats and cheeses which was UNREAL!  The olives and mustard that it came with were awesome.  (2) Pork pancakes - these were different than anything I have ever had and were tremendous! (3) Chicago Poutine - this was also awesome!a great combination, fried potatoes, cheese curd, bacon, etc,,,what more can you ask for! (4) Baked goat cheese and roasted vegetables - really good!
Our waiter (Brett?) was outstanding.  Very courteous and informative.

We so badly wanted this place to be as good as the Turf Room which is a favorite of ours (same owner). Hardware is awful. The food is just not good. They tried too hard to be trendy and forgot that most people don&#39;t actually like food like that. I sort of expect to find sautéd baby seal flippers or stenciled roast beef wrapped in dolphin skin as specials. There was literally nothing good other than the rolls and a few items on the meat and cheese board. 

The &#34;mock risotto&#34; was like eating weeds. The hanger steak was not good. 

We literally cannot remember disliking any restaurant this much. Normally when places try to be chic, the food is at least good (just overpriced). We think the Turf Room, in contrast, is a bit pricey but worth it with a great atmosphere and truly delicious food. 

In the past, when disliking a restaurant, we tended to think maybe it was just a single not great experience and try again. Not this place. As soon as we saw the menu, my wife and I both wanted to leave. 

We strongly recommend reviewing the menu before going. That will shed light on what I am saying."

Service was terrible.  Plenty of wait staff bringing out food and clearing tables but our waiter took 15 minutes to take drink and appetizer orders and never showed up to take a dinner order.  Flagged down the manager after 45 minutes and he was nice enough to place our dinner order.  He didn&#39;t seem too surprised nor did he make any attempt to compensate for his staff&#39;s lack of effort.  I can only assume that it&#39;s because this happens on a regular basis.  Didn&#39;t really have any interaction with the waiter until he brought our check.  

This is could be a really cool place but management needs to address a number of issues, the first of which is the service issue.  The food and circuses don&#39;t justify a return visit."

The rustic art outside, the place seems to be recycled everything. The bread roll they served is from the brewery which is actually good. The freshest salad I&#39;ve ever eaten, from their own garden. Drinks are very special. The inside looks like everything is repurposed and very artistic. Drinks are kinda expensive.

We orders the 4 cheese board. When it arrived, I was shocked by the small portions. We orders 3 sandwiches and a salad. The sandwiches were decent sizes; however, the shrimp Caesar salad was tiny. The shrimp were sliced in half to make it look like you had a decent amount of shrimp. What was most disturbing was the wilted partially brown lettuce. It looked like it sat on the counter for 2 days. 
We found the service a bit slow for a 2pm lunch on Saturday with an empty restaurant. We had to ask for drink refills."

I felt like the flavor needed to pop more.  We did not order alcohol so this review is all about the food.

Fish and chips were good, but not worth the cost.  3 chunks of swordfish and veggie chips.  Again, good but not great.

I enjoyed the Chicago poutine but would pass on the ricotta dumplings.  Bland!

The best part about this place is its mere existence.  Our town needs these types of places desperately.  It&#39;s modern, forward thinking and cool.  

My hope is that the menu changes in 6 months so I can return often."

Hundreds of types of whiskey and bourbon,  lots of home brews and homemade meats and cheeses.  Local food sources and everything fresh!  Service was stellar. We started with the meat and cheese board.  It came with homemade crackers, mustards and jellies.  Our favorite item was our appetizer of pork pancakes, served with a quail egg and blueberry drizzle.  The Korean pork was also tasty.  A meal here would not be complete with the ho-hos for dessert!  This is a neat concept and the flavors are awesome!"

I had the beer sampler and didn&#39;t like a single one of the four beers.   Admittedly, I can be happy with a cheap American beer, but all beers were hoppy, skunky or strong.  The food arrived and my girlfriend had the ceasar salad with shrimp.   Multiple types of lettuce, with a few shrimp thrown in, incredibly plain and boring and some of the lettuce appeared cooked.   I had the brisket, and the bread was decent, but the pork was lacking flavor and worse, loaded with fat.    Honestly, it&#39;s been a while since I have had such a poor experience at a restaurant.   Service was good."

Our waiter, once she finally greeted us, you could tell was not overly joyed to help us. No apology and acted rude when we asked to leave something out of a dish.

Food:  Small portions.  He loved his Chicago hot dog and Chicago Poutine, but my salad entree was tiny tiny.  I was excited when I saw the menu, but was then told that was the lunch menu.  :(  The dinner menu didn&#39;t have much that I liked so I got a salad.

Drinks:  If you love beer and whisky, this is your place.  If you go with someone that doesn&#39;t (like me), there aren&#39;t any good cocktails with vodka or rum or tequila available.  

Atmosphere:  We were outside which is close to the road, yet the music blocked out the car noise which was good.  Not too loud to carry on a conversation either."

We are big fans of the owner&#39;s other restaurants Turf Room and Newsroom (Minneapolis). We have been looking forward to trying this place and although I gave it 3 stars, the review is based on service and I believe kinks will be worked out and we will be back to give them another shot. 
-food is great! (Coming from a self proclaimed Foodie). Yes, it&#39;s expensive and small portions, but you have to know what you&#39;re getting into when eating at these sustainable, farm to table, locally grown places. You are getting clean, delicious, no cancer causing food!
**I&#39;m not sure this place will thrive in the suburbs, seems more like an uptown Minneapolis concept where people will appreciate the concept a bit more than suburban housewives. (I can say that. I&#39;m a suburban housewife, but from Uptown Minneapolis.)

-we had two people try and take our order- no big deal, happy someone was eager to serve us. 
-we were brought the wrong appetizer- the waitress came over and apologized, she thought that&#39;s what we ordered. I had asked her to give recommendations initially and she put in an order for one of her recommendations which we didn&#39;t order- I can see how the mistake was made, nbd. We ate it and it was delicious. And then we paid for it. (Maybe at least give a little discount for the mistake??)

-excited to dig into my leftover mock risotto at home 2 days later and opened the bag to fine someone else&#39;s half eaten pasta. C&#39;MON GUYS......

Either way, kinks will be worked out and we will give them another shot in a couple weeks!"

After driving past it literally every day, watching it get built, we could not wait for it to open. While we were hoping for a place that was something different than Bulldog&#39;s and cheaper than the Turf Room, it ended up being portions an 1/8 the size of Bulldog&#39;s and even more expensive than the Turf Room. I get the whole &#34;sustainable&#34; thing, but really?! The prices are ridiculous, and the fact they think you can share each plate between 2-4 is a joke. We have been there twice. We went there once on opening day, since it was my birthday the next day. For three adults, we each got one alcoholic drink. They were $12-14 each. Good, but not worth the price in North Aurora, maybe at a bar downtown Chicago, but not in the outer burbs. We then split a salad, the salmon plate, and the Korean bbq. The bill was like $90 and we left not even remotely full. 

OK. 
We tried again, just to get drinks and apps with another couple a few weeks later, since they had not been there yet. The waitress started off with this 5 minute speech on the menu, and then didn&#39;t come back for like 10 minutes for us to get our drink order. We each got two drinks (we had no kids for the night, so our bad on ordering 2 overpriced drinks each), the medium charcuterie platter, and the poutine. Better options than what we ordered the first time, but still, it wasn&#39;t a ton of food for sharing. Our bill was about $115. The waitress didn&#39;t come by very often, and it still was a boatload of money for mediocre service, and a charcuterie plate with lotssss of open space on it (it&#39;s $20, fill up that board for goodness sakes!)

We will not be going again unless they make the portions bigger or reduce their prices. I think the reviews have shown that people around here aren&#39;t going to keep giving this place business when they shell out a ton of money and leave hungry. Hardware has great ideas, and concepts, but I hope they listen to what their customers are saying."

The charcuterie board had a fantastic assortment of smoked meats (duck bacon and pickled pears! to die for), cheese, nuts and olives. The truffle cheddar and camambert brie are a must try.

My daughter and I almost licked the goat cheese appetizer board clean. Highly recommended.

We split the Korean pork dish and were glad we did - the portion was huge! Very flavorful and another recommendation.

I&#39;m not typically a beer or whiskey drinker but their assortment was wide, deep and sophisticated. The servers were knowledgeable, and offered excellent  suggestions while Nick, one of the owners, made a special effort to meet and greet and make sure we were taken care of by the staff. Service was cheerful and fast.

Ambience is lovely (great music). The green sustainability efforts with the gardens, greenhouse and hop farm tip this review into 5 stars. We&#39;ll be back."

Try the octopus where you get about four to five quarter inch pieces in a medley of store bought bag veggies. I couldn&#39;t get full. Had some weird gas after.

I believe it is a good idea and could someday be a great place to eat and hang out. Right now they have too many missteps for a place that charges what they charge for a night out. I am happy that i tried Hardware but it is not a place i will spend a lot of time at. They have a really nice outside area but it is in view of a busy street. All they had to do is turn the building 45 degrees and they could have avoided most of that. Who would spend that much on a building and not plan the design better.

I would suggest you try it for the experience but my guess is that it will be a one time meeting."

They had (6) home brews on tap at $9 a pint...Steep. Got the flight and they were all very good. If you&#39;re a whiskey drinker and can&#39;t find your poison here with over 300 selections not sure where you&#39;ll find it. 
Both times we&#39;ve been here the staff has been very good and attentive, Went for lunch and dinner, a bit of difference between the menus. They do have a green house, smoker, pack their own sausage and offer meats and cheeses from local farms. Very cool.
The menu....interesting and different love the creativity and quality of the food seems there, however when you go with a group and you have the one or few people that aren&#39;t adventurous to try new things they really lack any of the safe staple items, Sirloin burger, Filet, Adult Mac &amp; Cheese etc. this is not your buffalo wrap type of place. I see in other reviews comments on the portions, the shareables on the menu...not so much and the prices are a bit high especially for N Aurora.
They also own Turf Room right up the road.
Can&#39;t say we will be back anytime soon, between St. Charles, Geneva, Naperville Wheaton there are a lot of choices out there.
It&#39;s worth a try and see what you think, if you like whiskey and a creative menu that is more reasonably priced head up the road to Barrel &amp; Rye in Geneva, very good and consistent.

They opened Saturday at 3pm and we were there Sunday at 4pm. Just a party of 2 and the place didn&#39;t get busy until around 5pm. Ambiance was cool. Patio wasn&#39;t open yet or we would&#39;ve sat there. The inside tables felt much too close to each other for comfort. They had over 330 whiskeys on the menu! They have their own greenhouse, grow their own hops, and are self-sustaining. The water glasses were made of repurposed wine bottles and the serving boards were made of old barrels! Very cool. We ordered a medium charcuterie board for $20 (they pick the meats and cheeses for you) and it was delicious! Craft beer was just okay, but I&#39;m more of a wine gal. Our bill was $114 after food, tax, tip for a beer flight, 2 porters, charcuterie, and 3 small plates to share: Poutine, Korean bowl, and fish&amp;chips. Unfortunately, they were out of the ribs and pot pie 25 hours after their grand opening the previous afternoon. Those were the first 2 items we wanted to try, but they must&#39;ve been popular! I will definitely try this spot again. Next time I&#39;ll order wine, probably do another charcuterie board, and I&#39;d likely order the Poutine again. I&#39;d skip the Korean bowl because it was too spicy and I&#39;d skip the fish&amp;chips small plate because 3 little cubes of fried swordfish for $21 was too expensive and not tasty enough for us. Overall, a decent addition to Kane County. Turf Room, their other location up the road, will continue to be my top pick in the area."

I was hoping for comfort type foods like burgers and Mac and cheese, but instead the menu is full of items like &#34;duck under glass&#34; and &#34;mock risotto.&#34;    What does make this restaurant unique is that everything is sustainable and repurposed....this lends itself to long speeches by wait staff which seemed pretentious to me and deemed &#34;hipster&#34; by my husband.

The design, asthetics and flare of the restaurant are nice. They obviously put some money into the place. I went in excited to try the beer but was taken back a bit at at the $8.50 - $9.00 cost for a pint and $30 for the first 32 oz Howler fill? $10-$14 refill. Am I in River North or the far west suburbs? I did have the nitro IPA and it was pretty good though. 
When looking at the food menu, the first thing I noticed was a $9 all beef hot dog. Really? Some of the items on the menu are labeled as Shareable. I initially thought this would mean bigger sizes but apparently I&#39;m not a restaurant veteran and should have known this means smaller portions. Duh! I had the Korean Pork dish and it was good but just small. It didn&#39;t fill me up for $13. My brother had the Brisket Sandwich. The portion was underwhelming. The Brisket needed to be cut with a knife to prevent all the meat from being pulled out with one bite. On the positive side he said the flavor was great. 
In summary it&#39;s overpriced with small portions. You&#39;re dollar will not go far here but the flavor and creativness is there. If you&#39;ve got a big budget and are in for a new experience, give it a shot."

Or what ever you want to call it.   Went there this past weekend as a group of 8.   Knowing this I didn&#39;t concern myself when they told use it would be an extra 15min.  From our 8pm rsvp.   But it turned into a 30 min wait.   We were sat and waited another 10 min for the waiter to come by.  We were giving one drink menu for 8. And had to wait another 3 or 5 min for another menu.  We ordered drinks and waited 10 more minutes for our drinks so we are now pushing 9pm.  Our waiter was so I&#39;m too good for this place that he was rude and jerky as we asked a few questions about the menu.    About the only thing that sounded appealing to me was the hanger steak and sticky chicken.    Which my wife and I shared.   My wife ordered a salad and this was about the worst I have ever had.  Just a few leaves of some kind our lettuce and a sprinkling of dressing nothing else!   

We had to ask for bread and the waiter mumbled something about us being so far away from everything.  As we were In  the back.    At various points he made other negative comments  as we  had to wait a long for our food I asked for more rolls and a soda which was met w/ rolling eyes.    I had had enough so when he came back I asked him if he had lost a bet and that&#39;s why he was stuck at our table.  I&#39;m sure my anger spilled into how I asked as his tone suddenly changed.   
As for the food the hanger steak was well done and SMALL.    The chicken was good but small.    After dinner we went to their other place the turf room and got pizzas   
Well I tried but as this is a 40 min drive for me not that I would go if closer.  But not again"

Don&#39;t bring your kids here, no kids menu and not kid friendly.

Many restaurants in Chicagoland have very similar menus, the reason is obvious, that is what the patrons want. Similar tastes, similar preparations, etc. If you are not an adventurous eater, then quite simply this is not the restaurant for you. The menu is extremely eclectic, and for people who are adventurous eaters, such as myself, this restaurant is paradise.

Table of 2 on a Thursday evening. As with any new restaurant it was moderately busy. There is plenty of parking available. The front of the restaurant entrance is lined with a wall of potted greens and herbs, pretty cool. In and out it took about 1.5 hours for 1 cocktail, 1 salad, and 3 orders of appetizers. Not bad but not super quick either. The menu is all meant for sharing portions. Which means slightly larger than a tapas plate in my opinion. It says sharing on the headline for appetizer and entree sections, so you should expect smaller portions (i.e. do not come here starving and bitch about quantity of food). Although it doesn&#39;t say what size portions the salads are. From what we ordered I take it as not an entrée size salad but not quite a side salad size either. Think of a side salad times 1.5 for food quantity. I take it as a nice gastropub to drink and enjoy a couple of high quality appetizers. The whiskey menu is outstanding and extensive and I hope to return solely to sample many of the offerings.

The barrel aged Manhattan was great and you can definitely taste the vanilla and caramel from the barrel. The quality of the greens were the best as you can imagine them being freshly picked daily in true farm to table style. The foie gras mousse was smooth and velvety. The Korean pork fried rice dish was awesome and I hope they never take it off the menu. Perfect &#34;drinking food&#34;. The salmon carpaccio was delicious and the arugula on it was so fresh.

Service was decent and as with any new restaurant it takes a while to work out some kinks during the busy times. We had a small issue of being charged for another tables drink on my tab. They voided out my original bill and rang up a new one while giving me a copy of the voided transaction. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and fairly attentive. The owner came by and asked how the foie gras mousse was which was nice.

Like I said earlier don&#39;t try to think of this place as something it&#39;s not. This isn&#39;t a Cheesecake Factory type restaurant with huge portions. As long as you remember that you should be able to enjoy it."

It&#39;s beautifully designed and really different from anything in the area. I love beer, and the pale ale on tap was delicious. The food is interesting; most of the plates are designed to share and are smaller portions. There is an entree section if you want the whole thing for yourself. The more interesting dishes seem to be in the appetizer/small plate section, though. We ordered the poutine and the pork pancakes. Both were good, though of the two I&#39;d recommend the pancakes. I love poutine and this one was pretty good but not memorable and could&#39;ve used a lot more cheese (but then so could everything, in my opinion). Overall, I definitely enjoyed my experience and would recommend Hardware to beer lovers and people who like trying food that is different and fun.

We enjoy going to breweries and tasting different beers, however at $9 for a house beer you limit how many beers you consume.  Seemed way overpriced.  For the food we were told they encourage sharing of food so we ordered a goat cheese appetizer and fish and chips for an entree.  Again, way overpriced.  For $20 you get a handful of chips and 3 cubes of fish.  Long story short we left hungry.   If you want to go and spend a decent amount of money, the food is good, but just didn&#39;t seem worth it at all to me."

I had heard some complaints from a few friends about the disparity between the price and portion size.  First up, I thought the food was well prepared and presented.  My girlfriend and I tried several things on the menu and were not disappointed, including drinks and dessert.  I did not try any of the homebrewed beer as it all seemed to be a variation of pale ales with possibly a porter/stout option.  For those of us that don&#39;t favor bitter, the other bottled beer options are fine.  I look forward to seeing how this establishment matures as there is some room for improvement, like more herbs/flavor in the mock risotto, a better balance between portion and price (even for tapas-style dining), and a more diverse homebrew menu.  I definitely recommend checking it out but until it becomes a better value, I would likely only consider this place for drinks or special occasions where I don&#39;t want to drive very far."

The hostess could care less and seems clueless, the tables are ridiculously small for all the crazy glassware, plates and crap they put on your table. They are also alarmingly close together- the place is gigantic, no reason to stack people on top of each other.
Youre not landing planes people! Turn the damn lights down. The Turf room is a cave and this place is like being on the sun.
As to the food- mediocre at best. Maybe the chef should try the poutine at Barrel+Rye.

The outside of the restaurant is super cool, we loved the outdoor decor. The inside is just as nice with neat light fixtures and comfy seating. They also have a very nice patio outside. We started with a charcuterie board, one meat and one cheese and it was very tasty. I had the &#34;fish &amp; chip&#34; which was very good - it was swordfish, which is exceptional, and my husband had the Korean pork entree. I see people complaining that they don&#39;t give you large portions, but with this type of food you don&#39;t want a LARGE portion, it&#39;s enough to satisfy and give you the ability to try other food at the table. The couple we were with had a salad and appetizer that we tried and it was also delicious. My husband and I got beer flights, which were reasonably priced, however you could only choose from 6 beers, and they were out of one of them. The beer itself was great. We ended our meal with the pork belly/ice cream dessert which I thought was delicious. Our waiter was superb and very friendly, knowledgeable and checked on us all night. I do agree with other reviewers on the bathroom situation, but we figured it out. Not a deal breaker at all!

My wife doesnt drink and was rather disappointed that the only non-alcoholic option was pop.  No coffee either.  The food is what really left us wanting more.   We ordered a salmon appetizer which was pretty good but lacking seasoning.  That seemed to be a reoccurring problem as my wife&#39;s steak needed some salt.  Also her potatoes were just bland, boiled potatoes accompanied with undressed, unseasoned lettuce.  No vinaigrette, no lemon juice, nothing.  I had the duck which I thought was a complete failure.  Undercooked, bland, and just kind of a mess on the plate.  What I imagined and what I received were vastly different.  The duck fat hadn&#39;t rendered either which left that unsavory flavor.  The saving grace was the pork belly dessert.  Smoked pork belly, Carmel sauce, cherry ice cream.  I would have loved to see more entree options from the smoker.  That pork belly was cooked perfectly.  Hopefully they get the bugs worked out because I can&#39;t see going back if the food quality stays the same."

The Korean fried rice was an explosion of flavors and served exactly like the fried rice I had in Korea. The guinea hen pot pie is hands-down the best pot pie I&#39;ve ever eaten in my life.

Thought it was good that the server explained that we could opt for sharing plates or a more traditional service style. When one person in my party did not order a beverage, simply because she did not want one, the server gave her a strange and unsolicited speech about how if she did not want a whisky based cocktail, there was a particular cocktail that could help ease her into it. Brisket sandwich was tasty, but small portion for the price. My husband&#39;s brisket sandwich had poor cuts of meat that were chewy. Two flights of beer tastings were served on warped planks of untreated wood, had spilled because they were overfilled and it was messy. Beer was nothing special. Ordered waffle fries which were not fries at all, but potato chips. From the time we sat down until we got the check was about 1.5 hours, rather slow. Strange bathroom situation (no signs). Strange check delivery device (baby blocks with everything rolled up and shoved into holes). Did not feel the music (kind of jazzy, adult contemporary) fit the motif (rustic chic whisky bar). Really wanted to love this place because it is close to home and I am a huge whisky fan. The prices for sharing plates and appetizer items were too high to be enjoyable for me. $50 for one beer flight, one beer, two brisket sandwiches. I don&#39;t think that simply working out the kinks from opening will be enough to entice me to go back. Not sure this concept will work for the area unless they lower the prices on food and alcohol. I will pay more for quality food so long as I perceive it is a good value. Dined 6/19/16."

The ambience is kitschy and fun. California style dining in the Chicago suburbs is here. I had the pork belly salad to start. The greens were fresh, and the dressing was light and flavorful. The pork belly was solid. I had a glass of house wine that was recommended by our server, and this was a miss. I was told it was full bodied, but it wasn&#39;t, and it was $14 for a half of a pour. The cocktail menu was a little overwhelming, although interesting. Beers and whiskies reign on this menu. I&#39;m more of a vodka martini girl, so I&#39;ll have to step out of my comfort zone next time. The cheese and sausage plate was good--house made sausages--a variety of cheeses and a great fig jam. I finished my meal with the grown up ho hos which were delicious. Our server was friendly, and did a good job of explaining the restaurant&#39;s concept and menu.

They make their own dogs from locally-sourced meats. The preparation is truly unique. It&#39;s almost unfair to call it a hot dog. It feels like a hybrid between a dog and a polish (although it&#39;s all beef). The toppings provide an unusually bright, tart, flavor explosion. And one dog is enough to satisfy a healthy appetite. The prices are higher here. The hot dog is one of the few affordable choices. That&#39;s really the only thing preventing the last star my rating.

I travel to breweries all over northern IL specifically to try their beers and the large hop yard out front drew me in.  I guess I am more of a beer person than a fancy small plate person. If you like unique small plates and whiskey then you will most likely enjoy the experience. Even though the place is very close to my home, it&#39;s just not the type of brewery I enjoy.

Located in an average sized strip mall space, this restaurant knows what they&#39;re doing. The restaurant itself is clean, service is exception, and the food is affordable and delicious. I knew it would be a lot of food, but I decided to order the combination platter anyway so I could try a variety of things.

This meal came with falafel, shish kabob, chicken kabob, beef shawarma, basmati rice, sliced tomato, lettuce, and a side of tahini sauce. Sure, that&#39;s a lot of carne for lunch, but I was glad I got to try it all. I of course wasn&#39;t able to finish everything but I put a pretty good dent in this $9.75 plate.

The falafel was perfection -- crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. All of the meats were flavorful and cooked just right. The rice and veggies rounded out the meal nicely. It was all very good. Mazmez offers a handful of other entrees and plates including wraps, salads, appetizers, and sandwiches.

Definitely check this place out! I will for sure be back next time I&#39;m in the area."

Being middle eastern I have certain expectations for Middle Eastern cuisine and this place was a complete let down.

Ordered the chicken breast and was told that they no longer carry that and only had the chicken shawarma. So decided to go with that choice. The chicken was over seasoned and salty and the rice was stale and crunchy. They charge you for extra sauce and no pita bread was included. Also got an order of fries which were stale and oily. Honestly I couldn&#39;t even finish my food. So disappointing.

Pita House is a millions times better."

Ok i have a little time now...baba ganoush was best we have ever had with creamy texture and great smoky flavor. Chicken shawarma in our past experience tends to be on dry side, not so here! Moist and flavorful.  Do not miss the rice ..... basmati cooked al dente with lovely touch of saffron.  Tabouleh fresh, lively lemon flavor.  
We have been back twice since our first visit consistently excellent, exceeded our expectations. Do not be deceived by the simple strip mall facade, this is really great middle eastern food, served by some really lovely folks who take great pride in their  product."

Restaurant was clean and played nice authentic music in the background. I ordered the combo platter but unfortunately my beef was very chewy. The onion has &#34;chat masala&#34; on it which was a nice touch. I did enjoy the rice which boosted by stars but unfortunately not enough of a reason to go back. The chicken shwarma was fresh and chicken was tender but just lacked the traditional flavor. The hot sauce reminded me of a saltier version of red chili paste that you get at chinese restaurants. Unfortunately I will not be back but I will admit the food portions are great and somewhere down the line the restaurant should consider a lunch special. I suggest Pita inn or Naf Naf for a  better tasting chicken shawarma.

Visited on a Saturday evening with the fam, and walked in to a completely empty restaurant.  Grabbed a couple of menus and a table.  After perusing the options, we settled on the following: vegetarian platter, combination platter, and fries.  I asked the young man behind the counter how many pitas come with the platters, and shockingly, he said none.  He must have noticed the puzzled look on my face because he offered to include them, no charge.  Ok, a bit weird but hey, he included them.

I was also taken aback at the $0.75 they tack on for every hot sauce and garlic sauce.  I can try to understand this if it were carry-out...but EVERY fast-casual Mediterranean place I&#39;ve been to (and I&#39;ve been to various all over the country) includes these gratis for dine-in orders.   Again, he says he&#39;ll include them since it&#39;s our first time...nice guy.  SIDE NOTE: if you&#39;re going to charge $0.75 for a condiment, at least fill the container up to the top. 

Out comes our food...and while it looked initially appetizing, we were let down by almost every single thing.  First was the vegetarian platter: The grilled vegetables were a salty mush, the rice was more like biryani rather than the usual fluffy pilaf variety, and oh yea, the aforementioned free pita was MIA.  But the falafel was pretty good, I&#39;ll give them that. 

The combination platter, however, was a complete fail.  The meat portions, considering it was a &#34;platter,&#34; were pitiful.  The chicken kabob was not a kabob but rather, marinated chicken cooked on a flattop.  The definition of shawarma is meat that&#39;s cooked on a spit and then shaved when ready to serve...but this was just chunks of chewy steak, again cooked on a flattop.   There was also a shish kabob was as uninspiring as the rest of its platter companions.  

So here&#39;s why I&#39;m so torn: because the people there are very friendly and genuine.  I want this family to make it, but I find it hard to imagine they&#39;ll break the 1yr mark if this is the best they have to offer.  Will I visit again? Most likely not."

My husband ordered the Combination platter.  It came with Falafel, Shish Kebab, Chicken Kebab and Shawarma.  His favorite was the Chicken Kebab.
We also ordered the Msahab Sandwich.  This was recommended by the guy at the register.  It was marinated minced chicken with mayo and tomato on pita bread.  They all came with some pickles and olives and radishes.  I liked the Tahini dip/sauce.

The meat is well-marinated in garlic, ginger, onions and spices - I cook Indian food so I can tell by the taste that it isn&#39;t just a quick and cheap liquid marinade.  

The baba ganoush is deliciously smoky, the hummus is silky smooth and the falafel have satisfying crunch.  I love the accompanying pickled condiments - turnip, pickles, green olives, spiced onions.  The basmati rice is lightly spiced and so much better than the competition&#39;s converted rice variety.

No. It&#39;s actually so crispy it scratch the inside of my mouth, but I didn&#39;t complain because it was pretty good. They use basmati rice which was very delicious and their meats are marinated well and taste good, I would definitely go back again I think they just opened they don&#39;t have a full menu quite yet, but hopefully they will continue to add to it. They have a little prep a bar there in front, and some of their items don&#39;t look super fresh, my only suggestion to them is to try to rotate their produce there so that they always present the freshest salad/veggies/olives .

This was one of our stops on a bar crawl and picked out specifically so we could get both beer or cocktails and dinner. I went with the Adult Mac &amp; Cheese. They make a big deal out of the fact that the cheese sauce is made with beer, but you could have fooled me. The whole thing didn&#39;t have much flavor even with added chicken and bacon. I had to heap on a heavy helping of salt and pepper to get it closer to something resembling satisfying.

Service was pretty prompt at the start but sort of fell off toward the end. We were in an upper area toward the back and away from most of the other diners and drinkers. The waitress was friendly and I think she was doing her best, but there were many times we wanted to ask a question or order something more and no one was to be found to help us out.

The cocktails were very good. I got a Moscow Mule and have no complaints about that.

I loved the decor. Great feel to the place. Service was awesome too. I had one of their craft beers, that they rotate in, an Arrogant Bastard Amber. It was really good. 

I decided to try their wings and cole slaw. Not sure why I didn&#39;t try a typical Irish dish, but wasn&#39;t feeling it. I&#39;m glad I tried the wings. I LOVE wings and most places over cook them or don&#39;t have any good sauces. 

This place has really meaty wings, and they don&#39;t slobber on the sauce. It looks like it&#39;s baked on. They were so flavorful and filling. 

The cole slaw is way more than a side. It&#39;s a huge portion and really awesome taste. 

Service was excellent. 

I can&#39;t wait to go back and bring folks with me and try their Irish dishes too. 

The only reason I gave them four stars, is their chairs seem very wobbly. I tried three, and they were all the same. Other than that, 5 stars! The food is terrific."

First, for some reason this traditional Irish pub was BLASTING Euro-trance/House/Hip-Hop music the entire time, making conversation impossible.

Then, the Cod sandwich I ordered was just nasty - no other way to put it. 
The breaded exterior was very dark and crunchy hard, as if it had been re-fried. 
After taking a few bites and exposing the interior, I started getting the odor of rotting fish and (oddly) ammonia. 
The (normally white flaky) meat was a shiny, semi-translucent and gray. It was inedible. 

Our server was apologetic and offered to get me something else but my family was finishing up so I declined. He didn&#39;t offer to take it off the bill and I didn&#39;t ask.

If there&#39;s one thing you expect an Irish pub to get right, it&#39;s fried fish."

I still have had terrible experience (and good, though overpriced food) there, but I did notify the:&#34;contact us&#34; link on the website after the dog incident (I assume it was the owner) Brian McGonigal answered within 24 hours, addressing each one of my concerns. 

Regarding the dog (my biggest issue), apparently it&#39;s a semi-regular customer who has been told before that her dog is only allowed in the outdoor patio seating, NOT inside, MONTHS ago, so he was surprised at my experience/that the dog was inside for any length of time, and said that the entire staff was going to be retrained/reminded of the policy. He seemed to generally care that I had a negative experience, and I really do appreciate it. 

I will probably go back one more time, because if not for the dog on my last visit, I would have said 3.5 stars (factoring in kitchen mistakes), so maybe I just always catch them on an off day. I&#39;m willing to give another chance, cause the Irish Dip IS amazing..."

I was shivering from the elements and wanted something warm, so I ordered a glass of white white and a cup of the French onion soup with my apple and goat cheese salad. 

The salad was only OK and needed some nuts and cucumbers, but the soup? It was love at first sip. Not only was it picture-perfect, it tasted out of this world. I&#39;m going to have cravings for this soup for a long, long time. 

The drink menu was exactly what we were looking for, a mix of beer, wine, and mixed drinks. I ended my meal with an Irish coffee (decaf). It was pretty great, as well. 

The pub itself was pretty lively on a Saturday night and featured a live cover band, making for a festive atmosphere. I loved the shape of the building and the cubby-hole booths. We&#39;ll definitely seek this place again next time we&#39;re in town."

I want to like this place, but something just keeps disappointing me. Now it was the Shepard&#39;s Pie. Sure it was made from lamb with carrots, mashed potatoes, etc. but there were absolutely no spices or seasoning used in its preparation, it was bland, no flavor, nada. Very disappointing! 
I took what I didn&#39;t finish and later added some garlic salt and Worcestershire sauce and what a difference it made. At least now it was enjoyable. I still can&#39;t understand why there was no flavor! Not sure if I&#39;ll go back."

There was about 10 people total. I arrived last after everyone had appetizers, however the waiter came by the table 3 times right next to where I was sitting with the group, and never acknowledged our table who was waiting quite a while and trying to get his attention. Finally he came by and was quite rude and unprofessional and started taking plates away even when we were still eating from them... And while he was taking my plate away with my food still on it, he still never acknowledged I was even there for me to order a drink even. Hope I never get this guy again.
Went there again with my family because I was craving some sweet potato fries and the dipping sauce which is yummy, and it was close to a child&#39;s event that day, and it was good and the waitress was nice. I had a pot roast type sandwich and it was delicious juicy and tender however my husbands salmon sandwich was a little bland but everything was cooked well at least. I would go there again, but I&#39;d avoid the salmon and the first waiter I experienced."

Service was great for a bustling Sunday afternoon with the Hawks game on. Our drink orders were taken regularly and the food came out timely and hot.

Adult Mac and Cheese was very good, but I loved the Shepards pie. The food all had great taste and there were plenty of Gluten Free options on the menu. The fine selection of draft brews rounded off a great dining experience."

We just didnt like the table next to us- not the restaurant&#39;s fault I guess but there were some obnoxious older adults that sat next to us and as their friends came they kept adding chairs to the point that one guy&#39;s butt was up in our table and we felt like we needed to move our table over just to not be so close to these wierdos. They could have said pardon us can we sit here sorry to bother you but nope- I guess not everyone has common manners but I guess the waiters catered to them because they kept ordering rounds of shots and drinks and they could care less about me and my girlfriend trying to have a girls night catching up.

Irish boxty (potato pancake) with corned beef and cabbage satisfied my hubby&#39;s craving.

The beer cheese sauce and pretzels knocked our socks off, although $11 seemed a bit steep for bread &amp; cheese appetizer.

It was inedible. Additionally, I asked for no salt on the fries, but they came salted anyway (the waitress gladly brought out a replacement). Instead I shared my wife&#39;s flat bread, which was okay,but did not have as crisp a crust as on previous visits. The waitress was very apologetic and did not charge for the fish.

Not &#34;Irish&#34; pubs with an Irish name that trot out the glossy cardboard shamrock decorations around St Patrick&#39;s Day, but otherwise work assiduously to grow the revenue numbers of the Miller Brewing Company and cater to ballcap-wearing twenty-somethings who &#34;need&#34; a place to watch sports and shout at each other over music that was on the radio when they were zygotes.

This one gets it right, not in the look so much (though that is a strength) but in the note-perfect vibe of low-pressure conviviality.  It&#39;s a great mix of folks of all ages, many of whom seem to know each other--and the staff.

This building was a bank, an honest-to-goodness, small-town, tall, standalone bank building with columns in front.  Inside, it looks like County Kerry, with a huge handsome bar and numerous tables in charming, architecturally eccentric nooks.  The music performance area is a small mezzanine overlooking the main floor.

You like beer?  So do they.  There is ONE Miller Lite tap.  They have Guinness, Harp, and Smithwick&#39;s, as you would expect.  They have some standard but solid favorites such as Blue Moon, Stella Artois, Hoeegarden, and 312.  Great Lakes, Breckenridge Brewery, and Leinenkugel&#39;s are represented, and they have some other excellent choices such as Murphy&#39;s Stout (God bless it) and Murphy&#39;s Red, not to mention Delirium Tremens, Pilsner Urquell, and Bell&#39;s Brown.  So, basically, a beer for every preference, occasion, mood, hour of the day, you name it.

Live music every weekend, friendly bartenders, a warm suburban crowd, and a food menu.  Sure, there are TVs but you can ignore them if you like.  This would be the best local pub in almost any neighborhood in Chicago, but you would probably ruin it by putting it in almost any neighborhood in Chicago."

The service was really quick, and although it wasn&#39;t overly friendly, it was efficient. My Guinness was poured perfectly and was delicious. My girlfriend had a Stella and a Blue Moon and both...well, they tasted like they should! That may sound funny to novices, but many of us frequent beer drinkers can tell when something is off, such as in the lines...these all tasted quite good.

OK, so the food - we had an order of the Trinity Sliders off the app menus. These were basically corned beef on mini pretzel rolls with a delicious spicy mustard. Really tasty...we both enjoyed them greatly.

They have a good beer selection ( I can&#39;t partake in it right now, but the man was happy with it), I dig the decor, and our waitress was really sweet.

For appetizers we ordered the Bryan and Guinness wings, and our waitress warned us that the Bryan wings were really hot and she couldn&#39;t take them back if we didn&#39;t like them. We usually order wings the first time we go to a place, and they&#39;re rarely as hot as they&#39;re made out to be, so we were curious to try these.

The wings are big, and have a nice char on them. The Bryan wings were hot, but not so hot that they didn&#39;t have any flavor, they were really good! They are definitely hotter than your standard hot wing you can get at other places, which was good for us. :) If you love hot wings you need to try them. The Guinness wings were also good, but we were hooked on the Bryan wings.

The french onion soup was ok. The broth was sweet instead of savory, and is the only reason i&#39;m giving this place 4 stars because everything else was excellent. 

The man was going back and forth between the shepherd&#39;s pie and the pot roast so he asked the waitress, and she said that her favorite thing is the pot roast. He went with that, and it was absolutely delicious. One of the best pot roasts either of us have ever had. ( He said that mine is better, but he&#39;s a damn liar. A sweet damn liar.)

I went with the Kilkenny burger with pepperjack, avocado, bacon, and sauteed onions. I was a little worried about ordering it. I&#39;m currently pregnant and can only eat well done burgers. I&#39;ve gone to a couple of places and ordered a burger well done, and it ALWAYS ends up being medium rare, and then I can&#39;t eat it and have to bring it home. It&#39;s always aggravating because burgers never reheat as well, and I hate sending food back. I had a perfectly well done burger, with a nice char taste on the outside, and the toppings were plentiful and tasted good together. I was really, really happy with my burger, and glad and relieved that they actually cooked it how I wanted it. so THANK YOU!


The only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is the french onion soup, everything else was excellent, including the service. I make homemade french onion soup, so that does make me more critical, but if they fixed the broth and made it savory, I would be completely won over. 

Overall it was a great dining experience and we will definitely be back."

Their order included fish and chips, Irish boxty, and a salad which they were all very happy with.  My order was the full Irish breakfast.  When it arrived, it looked delicious and indeed it was.  However, I was surprised to find just a single rasher of bacon.  I mentioned this to our server Jordan (who was charming, efficient and helpful) and she said that she would check with the chef.  A few minutes later she came back and let me know that the chef said that this was standard for the order.  I&#39;m stunned that a $13:50 breakfast only comes with a single rasher of bacon and a single banger (this is perhaps the highest price I&#39;ve seen for a breakfast platter).  I don&#39;t recall this being the case at any similar place.  Upon rereading the menu I can confirm that it does describe the breakfast as including rasherS and bangerS rather than one of each. Why list them in the plural if you&#39;re only going to serve one?  It might seem like a small quibble but having proper Irish bacon was a large part of the reason why I placed the order.  They need to update the menu to reflect this.  I was very tempted to give a lower rating, but because everything else was so nice I didn&#39;t think it would be fair to do so."

I would return, but I would hang out at the bar instead of coming for dinner and sitting at a table.   The atmosphere was great!  I&#39;ve never been to Ireland, but I definitely didn&#39;t feel like I was sitting in Barrington, IL. 

I ordered a reuben with no sauerkraut (just wasn&#39;t in the mood) and I was happy when our food was brought out and my sauerkraut-less reuben hadn&#39;t been mixed up with dad&#39;s which had the kraut on it.  Everyone&#39;s order was correct with all the correct condiments and garnishes, a big plus in my book.  The food was okay, about what you would expect. 

The one minor drawback was that the service seemed to be slow.  We were in fairly early on a Wednesday evening (got there around 5:30) so there weren&#39;t a ton of patrons.  Most were by the bar.  The service felt slow for the day/time and our very polite waitress took a long time to grab our bill back and run our card.  One thing I really enjoyed about our waitress was her honesty.  My mom asked about the chicken pot pie, and she told her it was the only thing on the menu she wouldn&#39;t recommend.  I was happy to hear her honesty instead of my mom ending up with something she didn&#39;t like just to get a sale.

Check it out and stay for the drinks."

Although McGonigal&#39;s said they would have outdoor seating by Memorial Day, there was none when we got there, so we went inside.  Upon walking in we were assaulted by extremely loud music blasting from the sound system.  To make matters worse, the &#34;music&#34; was some kind of trash that was totally out of character for a place that&#39;s trying to position itself as an Irish pub.  :-(

We were looking over the list of draft beers (which seemed much more abbreviated than the list they have on their website) when the next song came on and it was even more obnoxious than the song that was on when we walked in.  

That was enough for us.  We got up and walked out."

So I started with the Cobb salad which consisted of a small amount of romaine 2 cherry tomatoes sliced in half 1 piece of blue cheese ? And some eggs crumble. The blue cheese dressing I think was mayo with a piece if blue cheese in it. All this for $8.50? A Wendy&#39;s side salad is bigger! Oh and it was accompanied by 2 pieced of the driest Irish soda bread I&#39;ve ever had. So still being hungry from my 10

Pros:

- Food quality is pretty high. Fish and chips were my favorite. Fries were seasoned and tasted really good. Fish was not bad. A little over breaded and overcooked, but does the job. 
- Overall the restaurant and bar area looks very clean. 
- Location near the train in Barrington is a huge plus. 
- TVs are generally showing something sports related and they play the sound from the TV rather than some annoying music that I don&#39;t want to be blaring over my conversation. 

Cons:

- Service during lunchtime can be a bit slow. I have had different waitresses on each occasion and found that the last waitress was an improvement. Expect to be eating there for at least an hour for a table of two. 
- The chairs in the bar area are incredibly uncomfortable to sit in, especially if you sit for an extended period waiting for food. Try to get actual seats over stools. 
- Food is a bit pricey. For Fish and Chips and two iced teas plus tip, it is over $20. Its good, but not that good."

I&#39;ve had the Fish n Chips and turkey club, both good, but I will definitely be back for the Fish n Chips. I&#39;ve been here for St Paddy&#39;s as well as their open bar NYE party upstairs. Always attracts a good crowd of your typical Barrington patrons. The owners are great, and really put in the effort to grow their customer base with live Irish music, events, an updated Facebook and newsletter.  Of course as a &#34;newer&#34; restaurant, enthusiastic owners should not be surprising, but it really is nice to see the passion they have for their business come through."

Not wanting to admit exactly how often I go here, I have been here about 5 times since my last review.  I have gone for dinner, lunch, and another bar crawl since then, and every experience I have had has been nothing short of awesome.

My favorite things there are the strong mixed drinks, the fries, and the chicken sandwich.  The chicken is seriously so juicy and not dried out, and it comes on a delicious pretzel roll--you can&#39;t go wrong with that amazingness!!

On the pub crawl the other day, my friends and I were a HUGE group of 15 people, and our waitress kept up with us like it was nothing.  She even got us a plate of pickles.  I wish I could remember her name and the girl who served us before that, because they were awesome.  I think I will have to go back JUST to inquire about this.  Their boss needs to know how great they are!

The place is clean, fun, and a great time all around!

The interior is warm and inviting...maybe a bit more &#34;themed&#34; than actually &#34;authentic&#34; but a decent environment. I know a few of the staff members (they used to work at the Curragh in Schaumburg before it closed) and they are GREAT additions to this place!

I don&#39;t like their 16 ounce pint glasses...but, I realize they are acceptable and market standard (the only true pint glass in my opinion are the 20 ounce tulip glasses, but I am getting snobby, so will stop)...The aforementioned staff will ensure the pour is proper! While I am a professional bar hopper, I have never had a drinking session in this place (I don&#39;t drive when I drink, and this is a bit out of taxi range for me), but I know they have some good musical acts like Morgan Fingleton and Fast Eddie MacAteer...awesome!

I have had a couple of dishes there - Chicken sandwich...awesome! I have had it three times and it has never ever been overcooked (and is there anything worse than a rubber shoe of a chicken breast?)...I know it is just a sandwich, but it is possible to screw up and McGonigals really delivers a quality product!

The chicken boxty - always a fan of a decent boxty! I was not disappointed!!!! I did have to use table salt though (which I NEVER use), but once that was added, I was very happy.

The pretzel nuggets with melted cheese...this stuff is Seven Eleven comfort food at its best...I mean that too...pretzels and cheese...whats not to love? Again, not exactly an old Donegal recipe...but whatever! 

My only bad experience here....the mussels. I went once with about 4 people and I was the only one at the table that didn&#39;t like them. For me, it was the broth....there was something about it that was just terrible in my opinion...but I think it was more a matter of my personal taste, rather than poor execution..."

Other dishes on the menu, yes they are perfectly fine, but to be honest...don&#39;t bother. 

They are seasoned perfectly and probably the best in the area. The patty is so amazingly juicy, and are cooked exactly to your specification. Never have I ordered medium and gotten medium-well or well done. I don&#39;t know what kind of meat they use, or what seasoning, but it is just perfect.

We arrived early so we sat and had a beer and appetizer in the main bar/diningroom while we waited.  The ambiance of this place freakin&#39; rocks.  It&#39;s three floors.  All dark wood.  Cozy booths with large windows to sit by.  even though some of the tables are close together you still feel like you have privacy. Subdued lighting.  A cheery skull sitting on a shelf behind the bar made this Gravestomper feel at home. 

Our waitress, Joy, was just that...a joy.  She was bright and funny and attentive.  The bartender was smiling, friendly and enjoying himself.

We had the best spinach artichoke dip we&#39;ve ever had.  A steaming cast iron crock surrounded by a mountain of fried pita wedges.  It was a meal in itself.

When we made it up to the third floor for the Green Drinks gathering we discovered another bar up there.  Patrick our upstairs bartender was just as friendly and attentive as the staff in the main lobby. And he had a great sense of humor.  I say that because at another green drinks meeting we&#39;ve attended at another restaurant we&#39;ve always received crap service from the bartenders.  The manager&#39;s excuse to us? &#39;You should come here for regular service, not just a green drinks meeting.&#39;  I know--that sounds insane right?  Like we weren&#39;t real customers because we met with fifty other people there.

McGonigals, however,  proved that every time a restaurant has customers come in--for whatever reason: whether it&#39;s a banquet, business lunch, or intimate dining--is a chance to dazzle them with yours service and quality.  Great job guys!  We&#39;re already telling our friends about you!!!"

In love with the Irish pot roast. Sorry mom, but I&#39;ve never had better then here...now if I could only figure out the recipe! Love the pretzel bread and cheese too but thisis what knocks it down a star....$11  for THREE breadsticks? Maybe it&#39;s the cheese,  which they give us way more then we ever use, who knows.

PROs:  The food is absolutely delicious and fresh.  As simple as it is, the Boxty is fantastic, the spinach dip is unreal, the fresh pretzels with cheese-beer dip.... yummmmm.  We&#39;ve never had a bad meal here.  Everything tastes so fresh and homemade.  I also love the atmosphere inside (it&#39;s an old historical building from the turn of the century). 

CONs:  The hostesses dress a tad on the &#39;unprofessional&#39; side and look 16 (this could be a CON for a guy I suppose!).  They go out for many cigarette breaks and drag it back inside with them.  Also, the noise level in there is insane.  You&#39;ll have a sore throat by the end of the night.  We also generally have to wait since the space is so small.  And parking can be a bit of a burden.

Yesterday my sisters and I hosted a wedding shower in the upstairs room of McGonigal&#39;s Pub.  Everyone there raved about the venue!

I want to thank Lisa and Nicole for all of their help and especially Ismini who made our event - as one guest put it  &#34;The best Wedding Shower I&#39;ve ever been to!&#34;  The accommodating nature of everyone there and the attention to detail throughout the process is what makes MCGONIGALS the place we will recommend to everyone we know!!!"

Not a good place for watching sports as the TVs are too small and hard to see.  The food is good, but can be inconsistent.  For some reason, my main problem is a heating issue.  More times than not I get something that should be hot, but is luke warm.  The other day it was luke-warm chili that would have been really good had it been hot.  I have also gotten the pub pretzels with cheese and the cheese came out with a frozen block in the middle once.  This problem seems to be a kitchen one, since I have had this happen at both McGonigals, and the WIne Bar and now the Annex.  Just heat up the food properly, please!!!!"

The atmosphere was great, the food was fantastic, but the service was sub-par.  So it&#39;s not a very large place inside and there was a Michigan vs. Notre Dame game on, so the bar area was busy, but there were open tables in the place.  We got seated right away and sat at the table for almost 30 minutes before we even got our beers.  The waitress was not very personable, she never even introduced herself.  I have worked in the service industry and find it really irritating when someone doesn&#39;t even give you their name.  When she saw that we were done eating she asked if we were would like dessert, or any other drinks and my boyfriend replied &#34;no, thank you, I think we&#39;re all done.&#34;  She removed the plates and left the table.  She came back with a dessert menu and told us to take a look.....ummm we said no, thank you.   Then when she returned she asked if we had decided on dessert, we told her yet again that we were through.  She left, and returned once more finally with our bill.  MY GOD!  We paid and skidaddled.  Seriously probably some of the worst service I&#39;ve ever experienced.  I mean I can understand if you&#39;re extremely busy, but tell us that up front and make sure you don&#39;t put one table before another, it&#39;s just crappy service!  I really liked the place, had a great feel, but honestly I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll return due to the lack of personality/skill of the staff they have.  Real bummer considering the food was really good :( wah wah wahhhhhhh"

I was very pleasantly surprised as I grew up in Barrington and there was NEVER anywhere good to go besides Wool Street, which I find to be just OK.  McGonigal&#39;s is very tastefully decorated and actually resembles an Irish pub.  Their booths have beautiful upholstery and the stools are cushioned and comfortable.  The bar in the center allows you to get a good view of everyone who is showing up for the BHS reunion at night.  I do like the crowd better here and find it to be less obnoxious than at Wool Street.

The menu is well-priced with a variety of traditional Irish food.  I had the Reuben which was one of the best ones I&#39;ve had.  It wasn&#39;t too soggy and came with a great side salad that wasn&#39;t one of those wimpy iceberg ones.  My friend had a chicken sandwich which was just OK.  She should have ordered something more authentic in my opinion anyway.

I noticed that for football games they have 32 oz. of Miller Lite for $5. I am planning to go back this week and will recommend this over Wool Street."

Only wish we would have had a place like McGonigal&#39;s back in my younger days while living in Barrington (aka Borington) where the only nearby fun to be had was on the humdrum Schaumburg strip. 

A legit pub meets dining establishment, meets live music venue, meets event locale, is exactly what this Northwestern &#39;burb needed. There&#39;s a bit of everything to be found here and fortunately, they do it all pretty well. From what I saw, the bar was jumpin&#39; with the younger set consuming Guinness while the &#39;older folk&#39; sat conversing at long, gleaming wood tables over tasties like yummy Reuben&#39;s, Irish Boxty, Shepherd&#39;s Pie and Fish &#39;n Chips. 

A great spot to throw back some wings, watch the game and let loose or even take advantage of this building&#39;s historic past as Barrington&#39;s oldest bank and secure the cozy private dining room that used to be a safe - and still boasts all the combo locks and vault features! 

Impressive space and an enormous upgrade to Borington&#39;s, er, Barrington&#39;s social spectrum. Welcome to your new watering hole, Suburbanites, it&#39;s a keeper!"

Two dudes whom were in love with my little sister in HS (and might still be) were chatting at the bar.  My mom&#39;s local political friend was hobnobbing at the table next to us.  I suppose that now that I don&#39;t live in B-town anymore that it&#39;s nice to go to one spot and see people you really haven&#39;t seen and/or care to see again.  

I did enjoy the 10 beer bucket special and the bite of my friend&#39;s reuben sandwich that she begrudgingly let me try.  And after a few buckets (don&#39;t worry, we had a DD), I almost had the chutzpah to go over to said chemistry teacher and berate him for the only &#34;D&#34; I ever received in my entire academic career.

The hostesses were a bit distance and rude they ignore you when you walk in even though you are standing in front of the host stand.  After about 2 mins they acknowledged and sat us, but were running short on menus and had to bring them to us later.  

Overall the atmosphere is great and they have a great beer selection!  I would not recommend for groups or families over 4 people because they have 2 &amp; 4 person tables with the exception of one family table tucked around back that can probably seat eight people.

We ordered a vegetable biriyani, lamb biriyani, and chole bhature - all three dishes were delicious. 

The biriyanis do have a good amount of spice, which we like, but if you not, spice can be adjusted for you. 

The chole batura is a combination of chana masala, and a friend bread know as bhatoora. The channa masala was so delicious, and was my favorite out of everything I had eaten. The bread was also very tasty, although it was a bit greasy. 

The prices here are so affordable, and the amount of food is more than enough. We were starving when we go there, and still ended up bringing half of our food home.

The food tasted good, but we did not get rice with our Curries which was unfortunate. The naan was flavorful, but flat and chewy. My partner&#39;s lamb curry had shards of bone in it.

Their prices were pretty low comparitively to many other places and the place itself was neat and well maintained.
We got their Andhra Spicy Dosa, Vada Idli combo &amp; Lamb Curry with Parantha dish and also their Black Forest Pastry.
Dosa was great , it was spicy and the size was huge.
Their black forest pastry was stale.
Their wada in the wada idly combo was dripping in oil and Sambar was bland.
Lamb curry with parantha combo was a total rip off, with about 2 spoons of curry and undercooked parantha.
Overall there are a few dishes that are worth the price and worth a visit like their biryanis and chat items , personally i would give up after my experience today but I will give one more chance for their biryanis ."

they are famous for their indian cake style desserts (with eggless varieties). Cake in India is unlike anything you get in america... so for those people looking for cake from home- you will find it here.

we ordered food to go:
-what&#39;s nice is that they bag each container separately (in case of oil leakage) so it doesn&#39;t go everywhere (no oil leaked)

we got:
-mutter panner: 
-navratran korma
-mutto chettinand
-chicken biryani
-lamb chettinand

everything of the above was standard fare, to be expected, comfort food. Nothing was mind-blowing or exceptionally good. There was a lot of gravy in the dishes (less veggies). Everything did taste different and it was of decent quality. I think if you want something fast,fresh, and spicy that reminds you of the comfort of home, this is fine.

2. it was not chapathi but phulka ; curry came with a kidney piece almost immediately had to throw up 
3. Made sure to tell I dont want any neck piece ; liver or kidney etc. guy behind counter tells me they never put it in curry ; I told maybe it was a mistake from last time ; finally eat the curry ; just plain chuncks on meat it is almost he boiled chicken and put it in gravy ; reminds of dirty food stalls quality food ; the poratoa was just put on griddle and not finished so it was rock hard ; me thinks it was frozen ; mirchi bajji one dollar a piece was reeking of bad oil ; same oil used in fryer again and again ....guaranteed to give you a heart attack.

Food is consistently delicious but is spicy and has Andhra touch, mutton curries and biriyani are worth trying. Menu is well displayed and provides adequate choices for Veg and non-veg folks.

Overall prices are very reasonable and almost half of a sit-in restaurant.

However the ambience for sit-in restaurant in very poor, chairs are of cheap quality and little or no though is given to folks who want to sit-in and eat. For kids who can&#39;t handle spice the only good option is Dosa.

I called to pre-order some food, just because i know they are so slow and i was not about to waste my time standing there for an hour. The girl picks up the phone and tells me to &#34;hold on&#34;, puts me aside for 20 mins. By that time, my husband reached the place and was talking to the front cashier girl. I could hear them talking and my husband told her that &#34;you have my wife on hold for over 20 mins&#34;. as soon as he said that, she hung up on me and lied that i was not on the phone. Little did she know that my husband was on the home phone with me, and i heard her lie. Then when I confronted her over the phone, the stupid girl lied and said she didn&#39;t know and blamed it on some other lady that she said answered the phone. I think i can tell who answered the phone, and it was her. She straight up LIED to my face, even when i heard her through my husbands phone. 


I rather go next door to Mumbai Cafe, this place is complete SHIT, this place is the next best thing to a trash can.Its so disgusting inside and I can only imagine what the hell goes on in the kitchen. Health Department needs to come HERE!"

Dirty dirty place. Is Health department sleeping? We sat on a table and they did not even bother to wipe it. It had remains from earlier party. We were hungry and had no inclination to find another place at that time so adjusted. Food quality has been going down in years but surprisingly with increase in customer base. Mostly Indian customers come to it because it&#39;s name resembles a famous bakery in India (not sure if it is same owner because quality is a big let down) and due to lack of Indian fast food choices in this area. We also gave it another try to see if there is any improvement. There was one, they have more siting area now with new booths added

The displays are dirty...electric wire from display lighting touches the food...tapes all over the display...no food warmers to keep bad bacteria away...we ordered chola bhatura, even the street vendor in India knows that Chola Bhatura is served with raw onion, pickle and lemon wedge...there was nothing in the plate...Bhatura were not fried completely and were like raw dough...we ordered 4 dishes(chola bhatura, butter paneer masala with roti and veg burger)...they were not only late they forgot one for which we had to wait another 30 mins...the forgotten one was veg burger...and it had a bun, aloo patty which was cold, lettuce and a mini slice of tomato..no cheese, no sauce, no onion inside 

Bottom line: Why worry about food quality or cleanliness or taste even, when you have so many customers lining up (due to lack of Indian fast food restaurants in the area)...as long as cash register is ringing...all is well"

First - The food at this particular store is awesome. If you like spicy Indian food... the biryani is a must for you to try. The Indian style popcorn chicken is to die for! 
The chaat items however are not as &#34;wow!&#34; They are still good but nothing to be too excited about. The pastry cakes are another matter though. While not that great looking, the cake part is perfectly moist and the cream is the right texture to make the whole thing turn into a creamy molten joy inside your mouth. The fruity ones are better than the chocolatey ones, but the best is the butterscotch. If you want Desi style cake - do visit. For all the above combined I award them 5 stars.

Last - It&#39;s a small shop with some seating arrangements. The place looks kind of shabby and the people behind the counter quite annoyed. They are not particularly rude but seem lack public relation skills. For the chilliness I felt in a bakery, I award them 2 stars."

But really.. Im sure its safe to eat, because we&#39;ve eaten here many times.. The saving grace here is the cake..

It took about 35 minutes to get my order. First, vada pav = worst ever I had. Samosa chat was decent. Dosa and idly was awful test. Was tested like made two days ago. My wife can make better than this. My son had black forest cake he loved it. 

But then this lady comes to buy bread and owner was at the register. He asked her for her photo id. I thought that was strange like she was buying liquor or something banned items. For buying bread this store check photo id. 

Then he went inside and cashier came out and told the lady for her photo id. And she said she can&#39;t sell the bread to her. Lady was asking reason why she can&#39;t sell the bread. The cashier response was they can&#39;t sell bread to her. 

I saw couple of bad rating for food on yelp. But the checking photo id when you buy bread was new to me. I hope they discontinue this practice when someone buys bread. And hope they make food test better. I don&#39;t think I am going to this place soon. But I will check back in few years if they stay open.


The bottom line is - the food was very blah.

The masala chai is nothing but hot water, milk base and ready made spice syrup mixed together. The filling inside the puffs wasn&#39;t anything great and the overall flavor of the puffs got ruined once they were reheated in the microwave and served ! We didn&#39;t try the pastry or cake from here after losing our appetite over the bland dishes we tried. The manager/ service provider seemed least interested towards customers. We are not going back to this hot breads ever ! 
However we have been to the other franchise at Naperville twice and found the food to be a lot better. The puffs ( even though pre-heated) and pastries are worth trying from there. And so is the case with masala chai too. Naperville franchise is worth a try!"

First of, no such thing as customer service. I was there with my family and the lady who takes your orders and who runs the cash register was very rude in many ways.  She never acknowledged us standing in front of her waiting to place our order. It took us nearly 10 minutes before she took our order.  ( We were the first one in line and the place wasn&#39;t busy at all at the time)  The food was okay, not good in my opinion.  I have had better food with better customer service at many other places. The place was very filthy. But since we were visiting Chicago and my younger son liked their cake,  we decided to give them another try. And the experience was HORRIBLE!!!!!!! Again I waited a while to place my order. Even though I was first in line,  the same lady kept taking other&#39;s order and chatting with someone. Finally I got to place my order. And when I asked her for number of Idlies in an order,  very rudely she pointed to the board where menu was written and said everything is written - read! How rude!  There was nothing written that clarified the number of Idlies in an order anyway.  But her rudeness didn&#39;t just stop there.  I had some food with me for my youngest who found their food very spicy. My husband took the food out that we had brought in for my son, and lady rudely told me to pack up my food as they didn&#39;t allow outside food. I completely ignored her rudeness and politely told her that we would pack that food back and won&#39;t eat there.  She still had to be nasty about it!  She said what do I mean by that?  I need to immediately pack that, NOW!!!!! Very awful experience!!!!!! I would not recommend anyone to go to this place.  Dirty place with EXTREMELY RUDE customer service!!!

This place should have 0 stars. That&#39;s as simple as I can put it. Please listen to all the other reviews with one or two stars, this place is not worth your money, time, or patience. 

We arrived and we were the only table around 7:30PM Sunday night, and were greeted by a server that was not so inviting or happy. I&#39;m not over exaggerating my experience, I had to write a review so you guys stay clear of this restaurant until things start to turn around. The sushi was kid sized and I&#39;m not kidding, the time we waited for our rolls was around 30 minutes, remember, we were the only table. Our waters were barely refilled, we had to ask for our tea to be refilled, when again, we were the only table there. The proportion is just not worth it, and I know I had to write a review to warn everyone about this place, it&#39;s honestly not worth it and please don&#39;t go.

DON&#39;T COME HERE IF YOU LIKE GOOD SUSHI, REGULAR PORTIONS, AND GOOD SERVICE. 

I know it looks like I&#39;m being rash but it&#39;s true, I don&#39;t know what else to say, don&#39;t even go here if you have a Groupon coupon please, save your time I don&#39;t know how anyone can rate this place more than 1 star and I can&#39;t even imagine what service would be like if there was tables than just us (a party of 4).

We were even happier to find out that they had a Groupon deal ($15 for $30) so we purchased that and had our dinner here. Sometimes, when you purchase things on Groupon, you do wonder why they needed to have a promo and sometimes you figure out why. 

I don&#39;t think this place is bad, it&#39;s decent, but unfortunately, it&#39;s not what I expected in terms of taste and especially price. Even with our Groupon, we had to really budget and spent a bit extra just to feel a bit satiated. My first impression was that this place must be under renovations or something because from a look-standpoint, they were very bare in terms of decor. Even their menu was just a sheet of printer paper inserted into sheet protectors being tied together by a ribbon. There was no sign of &#39;under constructions&#34; and previous historic reviews for this place went back as far as 4 years ago so I was a bit confused by the look of it. They also didn&#39;t have that many tables set up and the layout seemed a little bit not as flowy. The overall ambiance of this place felt like it was a place that just opened and haven&#39;t quite settled into their decor or feel established.

Service was very nice and friendly though and even their sushi chefs seems to speak Japanese or Korean or some sort of authentic language so that impressed me a bit. However, the overall taste of the food was just okay. 

The rice in the maki wasn&#39;t moist, it was dry and the seaweed wrap was too chewy. The content inside the maki was okay portion and flavor was kind of bland. They gave sauces to dip on the side which is good, but I prefer the sauces inside my rolls to really let the flavor sink in. Each slices of maki was very thin and small. I couldn&#39;t tell if this is how sushi really is and I&#39;ve just been too used to bigger rolls that got super-sized or what, but I felt like it wasn&#39;t really worth the money. They had sushi maki rolls range from $5 to the upper teens. But even when we ordered a Caterpillar roll at $9, it was the thinnest and smallest 8-piece roll I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;ve had other house special rolls that priced around $14 that were much bigger, and I think I almost prefer a big roll that is priced higher than a medium priced one that is so tiny... 

Psychologically, the price and the portions at this place just didn&#39;t jive for me. The food unfortunately, wasn&#39;t spectacular enough for me to really rave about it. I think it&#39;s decent, but until I have a more interesting experience here, I can&#39;t say it really stand out among other sushi places."

Plus my kids love it. New owner is making changes - we are hoping he is careful and doesn&#39;t blow it. Used to have the best maguro crunch but he no longer offers it.  Getting a little cheap on some ingredients.  But still great sushi. 

With that being said, I still give it 4 stars because it used to be five stars.  Food is still delishous. 

Someone needs to help this guy turn this place into a money maker, it should be busy all the time.  If they advertised but I know that costs money. I don&#39;t have time for restaurant business or else I would turn this places second goal an obvious sushi catering service !!!

Remember at sushi restaurants, your food takes time so do not expect instant service. When I order for my family we get carry out because it is much quicker !!!  

You must try New Doctor Roll !!! You won&#39;t want to share it !!  

Salmon teriyaki is my other favorite.  Juicy hunk of salmon (NOT frozen cut slab of farm raised dryness) almost seems poached.  Mmmmm...

Small place, not flashy, but good flavors!!!"

My fiancé and I finally got carryout from here tonight because of all the great reviews... and the tofu salad which was supposed to be vegetarian had crabmeat all over it. Food was way overpriced for the taste. And even though we ordered 6 maki they only gave us a TEENY portion of wasabi &amp; a TEENY portion of ginger.

We went there with high expectations and left without getting any food.  We were there at 5:30 and were 1 of 2 tables that was seated.  The lone server was engaged with the other table so the chef gave us the menus.  The server came over and took our drink order and returned with our drinks. That was the last contact we had with her.  She assisted the other table and then waited on a couple of pick up orders. That would have been ok but that took about 20 minutes.  My back was to the chef but my wife told me he was well aware of the situation but wasn&#39;t doing anything about it. So we decided to leave. At that point all the chef could do was muster up an &#34;i&#39;m sorry&#39;, so I replied that his service was sorry.  My advice, try another place.  Did I also mention that the prices seemed high."

The sushi when made by the head chef (and I&#39;m guessing owner) is great, many of his dishes on the menu are unique and innovative! Some are over price for what you receive though. When the food is prepared by under staff it can be very hit and miss, sushi falling apart when you pick it up with sub par, thinly sliced fish. Wait service can be friendly but terrible too, taking forever to take orders, bring orders, etc....one staff in particular is so timid and bad I now shy away from going here and look else where. It&#39;s hard to stomach the combo of bad service, high prices and walking away still hungry."

I live in the city, but will come back to the suburbs for dinner with my mother.  When we heard from a family friend about Sakuma, we had to give it a try.  We had to prebook two days in advance and allow the chef to prep their menu, and to ensure they had the appropriate fresh ingredients/fish they were serving.  Everything was absolutely delicious and incredibly fresh!  The fish&#39;s freshness is comparable to many sushi restaurants in the city.  The chef was extremely tentative and explained each course in detail.  Thank you, chef, for such a wonderful dining experience!"

It was really empty upon arrival and no one came to greet us immediately, some of the co-workers just stared and then someone came to help us 5 minutes later.

We were seated and the whole time I felt like we were rushed to order and eat... ok, I understand that we came at 9PM (late)..and the restaurant closes at 10PM.. but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been rushed like this at other restaurants when they were closing in an hr..(I eat fast, don&#39;t worry!)...they also give you mini warm towels to clean your hands before you eat.. and mine smelled like rags (not so clean after all...i think i just made my hands dirty..)...so I had to go to the washroom and wash my hands from the rag smell w/ the generic smelling soap......ahh..not a good start to the dining experience..

Food: 
Kake Udon ($8): not impressed at all.. I think I can make udon at home with more flavor and more ingredients!  they only had green onions and noodles in the soup...i&#39;ve had better at other restaurants....

Spicy Tuna Roll ($6): the rolls are really small and i&#39;ve had better at different restaurants for sure!!

Costs: appetizers and salads range from $7-$15, noodles range from $8-$15, specials range from $15-$25, Sakuma&#39;s specialities range from $6-$25+

Positive: free edamame (small dish), lots of space

Negative: customer service, costs are on the high range (not sure if it&#39;s worth it..)

I probably won&#39;t visit this place again.. :("

Sorry... but when I spend a good chunk of change on fine dining, I shouldn&#39;t be leaving there wondering &#34;So, what&#39;s for dinner?&#34; as I&#39;m leaving the establishment. That&#39;s all.

Not a great wine selection, but thats really my only complaint.  We have a tendency to order the same rolls all the time, but will always try new specialty rolls and always leave very pleased.  Some people get turned off as its in a small shopping strip, but definitely worth it.  Even if it looks empty inside that place stay busy with all their take-out business.

We had the special which included delicious duck, shrimp and chicken soup, a green salad and a plate with 15 different selections of sushi. 
They have built a wall to divide the dining room and another patron explained they are making a Sake bar which was confusing but not in use yet.
Unfortunately, the original owner/chef moved to California but we think he still owns it. His wife was usually there to hostess/waitress. Last night was busy and there was only the one gal that has been there for a long time and she was overwhelmed. 
The decorating is getting a little dusty and ladies bathroom could use updating and a towel holder that works.
They could probably improve the ambiance by dimming the lights slightly and playing soft music.

I picked up an Oyako Don, which is chicken with mushrooms and onions, served beneath an egg omelet (!) with some sauce and laid over rice. If I recall correctly, it came served with some really good miso soup.

I thought this was a relatively unusual thing to order for lunch, but I was rewarded with a really tasty meal all around. The mushrooms lent an excellent earthiness to the dish, and they gave me enough food for two days of lunch.

I&#39;ll definitely be coming back for more lunch dishes."

That being said, I will now move on:

Let&#39;s face it--my dinner here was very &#34;blind leading the blind&#34;.  Neither one of us had really ever had sushi before and he heard all about this place and really wanted to try it.  Meh, whatev, I am game.

We really should have taken someone with us who had slightly more &#34;Unagi&#34; (FRIENDS REFERENCE) with us.  &#34;Ahhhh, Salmon Skin Roll&#34;.

OK here is what we ordered:

*Shrimp balls (I don&#39;t know the exact name) as our appetizer.
*Beef Shogayaki - Thinly sliced sirloin sauteed with ginger soy sauce (comes with soup or salad and ice cream for dessert) and I upgraded to fried rice
*Some sort of chopped tuna that came in a mountain-like structure.  If I could tell you what it was called, I would.  But you&#39;re SOL for now!

OK, so the food was good, and the dressing for the salad was delightful.  However our food took a really long time, and it all came out at different times.  Really, really odd times.

It went like this:
My salad
My friend&#39;s meal
Our appetizer
(very closely followed by) my meal and fried rice

So I would have preferred to have the salad/appetizer before the meal, and my friend kept waiting for me to have something else to eat other than salad, but I told him to go ahead.

But my beef was goooood!  And the fried rice was amazing, too!

That being said, I am still a sushi virgin.  I need Candice in my life to show me the way of the sushi.  I will bow down to her.

I want &#34;Unagi&#34;."

Fans of this restaurant undoubtedly know what I am referring to, but the real differentiators at Sakuma&#39;s are the quality of the food and the technical and artistic skills of the chef.

Chef Sakuma is a perfectionist and professional of the highest quality, and once you have tasted his homemade sauces -- including his unforgettable soy sauce and spicy hot sauce -- you will also have a difficult time enjoying any other Japanese restaurants in Illinois (or the rest of the United States).

I recommend dining at the sushi bar and ordering one of the Chef&#39;s Choice courses (note: Chef&#39;s Choice for Two is great if you are dining with a friend) if you want a unique dinner course that changes each time you visit. Or, if you want to build your own tasting course, then I would recommend ordering several of the artistic and delicious sashimi entrees. My personal favorites are the Ethnic Tuna Sashimi, Sunset Carpaccio, and Hamachi Royale, but the Maguro Crunchy and Helmut Hurricane are also staples of a tasty Sakuma&#39;s diet. If you are more into sushi, then I would recommend the Spicy Tuna roll and the Summer roll, both of which should immediately demonstrate the unique flavors that can only be found at Sakuma&#39;s.

If you do not have a taste for sashimi or sushi, there are many other great options: amazing grilled beef (the skewers are served with an exceptional homemade mustard dipping sauce), numerous hot and cold soups that make wonderful meals (note: the dobin mushi is something each diner should try at least once, and the cold soba noodles and the hot nabeyaki udon that is served in a cast iron bowl are both also unbelievably good), and tasty-yet-healthy salads (that also pair great with a small order of sashimi).

For dessert, the banana tempura with honey and vanilla ice cream should not be overlooked, but I also enjoy the green tea ice cream after completing a Chef&#39;s Choice omakase course.

If you are a sashimi enthusiast and are ever in the Schaumburg/Streamwood/Bartlett area, I would highly recommend taking the time to drive out to Sakuma&#39;s for an authentic and unique Japanese dining experience."

My husband and I decide to sit at the Sushi Bar today to see our sushi being created by Chef Sakuma himself!   I especially liked sitting at the Sushi Bar because there is better lighting to take food pictures, BUT I digress. ;)

It was a great experience getting our sushi served to us by Chef Sakuma.  There was a mother and her pre-school child and a friend of hers sitting right in front of Chef Sakuma for lunch.  The kid would occasionally make shrill sounds, but it was fine.  Having kids ourselves, we understood.  Chef Sakuma and his son, Akira(?) were apologizing to us profusely because of that, which I thought was very hospitable of them to do so. It isn&#39;t their fault, but they still expressed their regrets on it.

We had our usual Sushi Set B, but we added two special maki rolls.  Perhaps we were overzealous since we ended up spending about $70 on sushi for LUNCH, but we definitely didn&#39;t leave hungry!  We rolled out like a pair of maki rolls!  Hehe

We had the Green Turtle Roll and the Fantasy Roll.

The Green Turtle Roll was very delicious!  I had never had wasabi tobiko (flying fish roe - wasabi flavored) before, so it caught me by surprise.  

The Fantasy Roll was interesting.  It was deep fried in a tempura batter and had a squeeze of lime on it with raw tuna and jalapeno.  It was also an interesting take on sushi and a unique experience!

Akira had welcomed us again since he remembered us from last week.  So, it&#39;s cool that they remember their customers!

We thoroughly enjoyed our sushi lunch at Sakuma&#39;s and will definitely return....next week! :)  Try a different roll!"

I&#39;m not a fan of spicy and there are plenty of options to chose from that are delicious. We always get the salmon sashimi. Yum! Whenever I go anywhere else for sushi (which is not often), I compare to this place and nothing comes close! I highly recommend this place and I like that they make the sushi right in front of you."

As the only Japanese restaurant to offer Sushi Making Classes to the public, we wanted to do a taste test and decide for ourselves if we would come back as students. I think it would make a great date.

Sakuma offers a 2-hour class for $40. You learn about the basic art of cooking sushi rice, preparation and use of various ingredients which include raw fish, egg and vegetable in making a sushi roll. You learn the technique of presenting it on a plate with a garnish. The best part is, you eat what you make at the end of the course with some green tea.

Cute lounge area tucked away in a corner with a tv, coffee table and couch. The servers wear a kimono. The decor is a bit outdated.

We arrived at 5:05pm with much anticipation. We were the ONLY customers during the entire dining experience. It was nice to have privacy while enjoying each other&#39;s company and food.

The complimentary edamame was undercooked.The wash cloth for our hands was cold.

I decided I wanted to order from their dinner menu which included miso soup or house salad and a scoop of vanilla, red bean or green tea ice cream. I chose the Uma Juu. For $35, I thought the house salad was tasty but too small. The broiled eel was served over rice in a large bowl. It was too big for me to finish alone. I had to give some to Jason. Unfortunately, he thought it was too oily and didn&#39;t like it.

He ordered the Sashimi Moriawase. A Small order is limited to tuna, flounder, salmon and yellowtail. He ordered the $35 Large portion of the Mixed Variety. The presentation was beautiful and fresh. Jason had a lot of seafood filet on his plate. He was disappointed that for the price, he wasn&#39;t offered a side of rice, miso soup or house salad or a scoop of ice cream for dessert."

I cannot get enought of their sushi. They are truely the best sushi around. Always fresh, and always delicious! Great variety. (Im not sure where the other folks below say it&#39;s all too similar.. clearly they have not tried the variety on the menu). 

There is only one thing they need to improve upon, which is the service.. and it all comes down to one person. She just doesn&#39;t know how to be a waitress and the owner needs to let her go. She is the only non japanese waitress and is just awful.

Regardless... I will continue to go since I LOVE this place and will not let that one person ruin my experience. The owner is typically at the door and the other owner is always behind the sushi counter. LOVE them!"

After our time in Japan, we tried to find restaurants here in the states that compared to what we tasted over there....that was a challenge!
Sakuma&#39;s sushi is comparable to what we ate in Japan...it is amazing, always fresh and we have never left unhappy.  
 The 1 star review seems odd to me...everyone I have talked to about Sakuma&#39;s raves about it.  Perhaps it was an off day or so...everyone has those, I&#39;ve just never ever experiences it at Sakuma&#39;s and I&#39;ve been going  there for 4-5 years on a  regular basis."

While the sushi was fresh, most of the rolls were 6 very small pieces. We have eaten at countless sushi restaurants in the area and in large cities across the country, and the size of the rolls here were very small (no more than an inch in diameter with small pieces of fish). This would have been fine if the prices were adjusted accordingly, but unfortunately they were pretty standard prices. In addition, the ambiance was slightly strange and the waitress did not provide plates, wasabi or ginger until the sushi chef had given us our last roll to finish. There were two of us and after having 3 standard roll and two specialty rolls, we were still quite hungry- something that has not happened to us when ordering this much before at any sushi restaurant in the past. Sadly, we will not be returning."

The other reviews are right. The looks of it are deceiving. Boring strip mall, bizarre decorating inside.. [I counted 5 ceramic cats from my chair. Not to mention Christmas garland &amp; Valentine&#39;s Day decorations in October]

But the food is crazy good. We love sushi and there aren&#39;t many great options in the Chicagoland suburbs but this is definitely a diamond in the rough. 

I&#39;d skip the $15 Mr. Sakuma&#39;s sampler [think that&#39;s what it was called] and head straight for the other stuff. The Turtle roll was highly recommended and was fantastic. Everything else was fresh &amp; really good. 

If you&#39;re able to reserve a spot at the sushi bar, that&#39;s definitely the place to be. 

Service was a bit slow but nbd. The owner&#39;s wife stopped by afterwards &amp; really seemed to care if we had a good experience, which was nice. 

Will definitely go back."

The maki tasted good, but although we ordered a variety of rolls, they all came out looking almost too similar.

The main reason I gave 2 stars and not 4 was due to our service.  I could never figure out who our server was (it alternated between two).  As it was a Monday night, there were only 4 or 5 other tables being served.  After we were finished eating, it took 25 MINUTES to receive our check.  We were asked if we wanted dessert, and after politely declining, all servers left us.  One of the servers kept walking past us and not even checking in with us, and the other server was drinking wine with a customer at the sushi bar.  I finally had to ask for the check, and it took another 10-15 minutes to receive our check.  With 2 servers and 6 tables, I expected way better service.

We will definitely keep going to our favorite sushi joint (Nikko sushi in Arlington Heights), as the food and service there are outstanding every time."

Although it may not make you full, it was the fascinating meal. Mr.Sakuma uses a lot of unique and different ingredients which I don&#39;t really expect to see in the US and definitely not in the suburb. We had &#34;Mr.Sakuma&#39;s special&#34; which was in bite size of different appetizers: tempura unagi, seared white tuna in soy sauce, sweet shrimp, tuna and Salmon with Avocado. I highly recommend this one. Another dish was Trio Chilli something. It was raw scallop, squid and octopus with different hot sauces. I love the texture of squid and octopus, not quite sure about the scallop though. Green turtle roll was great. Autumn roll and Scorpion roll was just ok for me. All the food presentations were great that I wish I brought my camera. 

I plan to go back there for its &#39;Gourmet evening&#39;. It was the 5-7 course fix prix menu for $70 include all drinks + gratuity + tax. I can&#39;t wait to go back. I took the sushi class there with Mr.Sakuma before. The class was fun. He showed us so many techniques that it ran over time by an hour. The service is also great, very friendly including Mr.Sakuma himself. His cooking profile is also pretty amazing such as. cooking for the Japanese royal family..."

The presentation is amazing.  It really is a shame to eat these pieces or art, but your stomach will certainly thank you.  I&#39;ve taken numerous people to this location and not a single complaint yet.

It doesn&#39;t get better, ever time we go somewhere else we compare to the quality of this place.  It&#39;s true, the sushi is uber fresh here.  There dishes are trasty, usually have rolls (specials in they work with my palet) Beef wrapped in green onions is just yummy!  Joy Lucky is one of my favorite specials which Mr. Sakuma has told me I must drink the liquid afterwards because it&#39;s good and healthy for you.  I always do.  Oh and if you call two weeks ahead of time you can order Sukiaki, which is just so delish!!  The whole restuarant fills up with the smells and everyone else including staff wishes they were having the same thing.  And for dessert, the best is the fried bannana.  There is always room for that!  Yum-O!  

Staff is a little bit slow, but we are Americans people!  Can&#39;t expect them to be any faster then they are because it&#39;s not their custom to runa round the place.  They want you to enjoy your food and experience.  And yes, Mr.s Sakuma&#39;s wife, Lidia is just a sweet heart.  The staff gets to know you, very freindly.

I&#39;ve read these rave reviews and I feel like we ate at a different restaurant!

The sushi was simply not good. The usual stuff (salmon rolls, sashimi prices) was mediocre at best: supermarket takeout qualify. But the special plates that everyone raves about were awful! Fish was swimming in tons of sauce, weird flavors, very little actual sushi. 

The worst part though is the service. On a not busy evening, our food took 90 minutes to arrive in full. We had 30 minute gaps between plates. But here is the kicker: our waitress made a rare appearance with a plate of food and announced, &#34;here is your - &#34; Then she paused, brought it closer to her face , and said , &#34;huh! I don&#39;t know what this is!&#34;. Then she took it back to the kitchen (!!!!!!) for a diagnosis.  Seriously? Who wants sushi mystery meat that&#39;s been paraded around a restaurant?

I have to give some props to the very nice older woman who realized the disaster in progress and took off from the bill the cost of our drinks .  Bt then, when we clearly wanted to leave and  told her we weren&#39;t having dessert , she looking pleadingly at our children and tried to talk them into ordering some ice cream. Not cool.

Usually I would give a place another try but this was so bad that I am posting now."

I don&#39;t get to go often, but Sakuma&#39;s is one of my favorite places in the &#39;burbs for sushi and okayo donburi, one of the classic Japanese comfort foods.  Imagine escaping the bitter Chicago winter by sitting down in front of a steaming bowl of rice covered with egg, chicken, thinly sliced onions, and warm dashi broth.  Pretty simple, but astonishingly satisfying. 

The fish is very fresh and they excel at both traditional sushi and some modern rolls.  One must have is the hamachi royale.  Imagine four velvety slices of hamachi lightly dressed with soy sauce, truffle oil, jalapeno, and garlic.  Un-freakin-believable."

Their spicy tuna roll is the best I have had.  Also, the fantasy roll is a delicious mix of spicy and crunchy. I could definitely eat it for a week straight and not tire of it.

The service is fairly quick, and for a sushi bar they are VERY kid friendly, which is so nice to see these days.

If you get lucky, you&#39;ll get a few slices of fugu - when in season - during the kaiseki meal. if not, there&#39;ll still be o-toro and chu-toro, just perfectly sliced, perhaps in nigiri form, perhaps in sashimi form. does it really matter? especially when Iguchi calls this place &#34;Sushi Power&#34;? there will be mountain yam soup, made for the previously mentioned Royal Family, there will be intricately balanced amuse bouche laid on hand-signed sushi paper. finally, there will be house-made desserts such as mochi-balls, banana tempura, etc.

there are a few &#34;levels&#34; of kaiseki differentiated by volume and quality. the best way to see what this is all about, is by looking at the pictures... after that, it&#39;s a transcendental experience good for 2.5 hours."

Melt in the mouth isn&#39;t quite the right words for it, but their tempura is deeelicious.

I&#39;ve been doing the sushi rounds ever since Lent started and by far this is one of the worst places for sushi. I&#39;ve eaten at most of the sushi places in Chicago from the high end Japonais to the typical joints like House of Sushi.

We ordered a couple of rolls and was very disappointed. The rice was dry and the fish looked like it had been sitting out for awhile. 

I think the other reviewers must work for the place or something. I questioned his credentials. For a sushi chef who&#39;s supposedly worked in some prestigious hotels -- the sushi doesn&#39;t match up! 

I hate fake postings and from the previous two postings it looks like something you would see in a brochure.

Hopefully the place will improve on its food but for now it&#39;s not good."

Teriyaki Salmon os great! 

I think its a nice place to bring a date. the service is good, its a nice ambience and its easy to order.

The price is a little higher so its not the Sushi joint you hit every other day, but its a nice close get away for me."

A group of five of us got take out sushi from here on a weekday. We ordered almost one of every roll on the menu and everything was delicious (I wish I could remember specific rolls to recommend). One drawback was that anything that included tempura was soggy by the time we got home to eat it (our mistake for ordering it in the first place). Their house sauce is amazing as well as the wasabi mayo dipping sauce. I would order anything from their menu and would sit down for dinner in the restaurant next time as the staff is extremely friendly and inviting.

In a very non-descript strip mall on a very non-descript corner in Streamwood resides one of Chicago&#39;s finest Japanese restaurants.  This place is sure to satisfy a wide range of expectations.  If you only enjoy sushi rolls, the creativity and technique are amazing.  I would suggest the Turtle Roll and the Summer Roll.  Every item in the elaborate rolls are carefully sliced, balanced in size and tightly rolled.  You can taste the distinct flavors working in harmony.  It&#39;s hard to explain how expertly the rolls are prepared.  Chef Sakuma also has some amazing sashimi dishes Flounder in seared in hot red wine and Hamachi Royale (which I believe is Yellowtail with a Truffle Oil sauce).  If you want traditional Japanese hot dishes, Sakuma&#39;s also excels on this front.  We really enjoy Chawanmushi which is a small dish of steamed custard with bits of shiitake, shrimp and other morsels.  Of course, the sushi and sashimi fish is exceptionally fresh.  I was very surprised to find this place where it is located.  It appears from the clientele that many Japanese in the area have also found it."

He tried cutting his half down further using the plastic knife they gave us and couldn&#39;t, so he went back to the counter asking for a sharper knife. Cashier sent a manager over, who promptly brought him another plastic knife. He explained he&#39;s already tried using that plastic knife and asked again for a sharper knife. Manager told him he couldn&#39;t supply a sharper knife, so Dad asked him to cut it down himself. Manager went away with sandwich, then came back - giving it back to my Dad, then left. Dad opened it up and it was a blooming mess - the whole sandwich and meat just rolled up in a big pile. it looked like manager did that on purpose. Dad ate it with a fork.

I love all the old (and some newer) Rock &amp; Roll decor and the delicious choices on their sandwich menu made it hard for us to decide.  We were surprised to see they even had burgers &amp; pastas dishes, too.  I tried the Hot Turkey Pastrami sandwich, which was piled high with sliced meat - and I only ate half of the big sandwich, taking the other half home for lunch the next day.  The Hubs tried one of their hockey playoffs season specials of Poutine w/Italian Beef on it for a Blackhawks/Chicago twist.

First.the person taking my order couldn&#39;t find the button for a Maxwell Street Polish on the cash register. So I had to explain to him what it was so he could ring it up. When he read back my order he said&#34;Italian sausage with mustard and grilled onions&#34;,I explained to him it was a Maxwell Street POLISH. When the food came out it was about a foot long and the diameter of a Ball Park frank, about half the size of what I get in Carol Stream Augustinos.
I wont go back to this location again."

It&#39;s just so hard to pass up their amazing subs!

They are located next to Menards, but when I&#39;m going to a home improvement store, I am on a mission &amp; there is no time for dilly-dallying - so Augustino&#39;s sadly went overlooked until now.

I love all the old (and some newer) Rock &amp; Roll decor and the delicious choices on their sandwich menu made it hard for us to decide.  We were surprised to see they even had burgers &amp; pastas dishes, too.  I tried the Hot Turkey Pastrami sandwich, which was piled high with sliced meat - and I only ate half of the big sandwich, taking the other half home for lunch the next day.  The Hubs tried one of their hockey playoffs season specials of Poutine w/Italian Beef on it for a Blackhawks/Chicago twist.  The gravy &amp; beef was darn good, though it could have had more cheese curds.  And their fries!  I have no idea why their crinkle cut fries are so good, but they were far superior to any other fast food fries we&#39;ve ever had.

Augustino&#39;s did not get the memo.  I ordered the Italian sub and it was the worst I&#39;ve ever had...and I&#39;ve eaten a lot of Italian subs.  
First, the bread was super stale and chewy.  
Second, the meat tasted like it was packed in salt for the past week.  I don&#39;t remember a time that I was so thirsty after a meal. 
Third, a whole raw onion on a sandwich?  Come on...
Fourth, the vinaigrette was very sharp and unappetizing.  They added so much of this vinegar to the sandwich that it pooled in the paper and dripped all over the place.  
I had taken the sandwich to go, so I wasn&#39;t in a position to complain to the staff. 
 
The rock and roll decor inside is a ripoff of Portillo&#39;s, is way too corny and looks antiquated...not in a good way.  The staff was quick and efficient, but other than that, not a fan at all.  
I suggest they go to a real Italian deli and try a legitimate Italian sub.  Once they do, they should change meat brands, start using all their bread daily, get a new vinaigrette and make another attempt.  Until this happens, I will not be back."

The place is all done up in retro 50&#39;s style so lots of cool stuff to look at.  Like their sister location in Carol Stream they have great sammies, salads and sides.  I love the bread they use for their sammies and they don&#39;t cheap out on the toppings.  I can never finish a whole sandwich. I am a huge fan of their bruschetta too.

We have had them cater parties and peeps rave about the food.  Fresh, large portions and it really is homemade.

I had a beef hot with cheese large cheese fry large drink. Fry&#39;s under done cheese tasted like crap. Oh the beef was the worst. the hot peppers where the best thing.

And though I didn&#39;t get a chance to enjoy the ambiance of an old time tile floor and rock n roll, I still say you can tell a lot from even a drive thru experience.

When on their game, this spot has fresh bread as well as fresh fix ins&#39;. No problem with the service either. Pleasant, courteous, with a sense of humor, too! (I guess the business suit seemed a little out of place). Even on Halloween.

Still, my All Veggie Sub with pepper jack cheese was great, and huge. It always reminds me of an Italian salad bread bowl: the 6 inch variety though. I also love what they do with an Italian Sub. Third standby choice: the Pepper and Egg. Reasonable prices too!

Though I don&#39;t get here often, on the occasions when I do I haven&#39;t been disappointed. Thanks guys ... and nice touch with the pumpkin! Us mobile Trick or Treaters need our chocolate fix!!"

+ Tasty food at a reasonable price
+ Outstanding atmosphere with tons of rock and roll memorabilia on the walls

If you like Americana and paying homage to days gone by, or if you&#39;re just a fan of old school music, don&#39;t be too &#34;American&#34; and use the drive thru. Park your Hummer and get inside the building to check out the tunes of rock and roll greats and browse the great wall art."

Luckily they proved me wrong.  Their gluten free sub bun is amazing.  GF bread tends to be super dry, but this was anything but dry.  They have other menu GF items as well.  I have yet to try them because I cannot get away from the delicious sub. I always get the turkey with oil, lettuce and avocado.  Delicious. 

I also used to order their homemade chips ( before being GF) and they were seriously the most amazing chips ever.  My only complaint- I wish they were cooked in a different fryer than the other items so I could enjoy them again!  (Cross contamination issues ). 

Keep up the great work!"

It didn&#39;t even know that this was right in my backyard. I&#39;ve been driving past it on Route 59 and had no clue. What a great surprise. I was so excited!

The food is just as tasty as the other location. Great sandwiches and sides. I haven&#39;t tried anything else because I can&#39;t break away from the corned beef reuben. It is the definition of awesome. I also love the baked potato salad as well.  I haven&#39;t tried anything else but from the looks of my friends&#39; sandwiches, everything looks great.

I love the fact that everything is made to order and fresh. There can be a big crowd but they seem to move everyone out in a good order. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is nice.

Augustino&#39;s did not get the memo.  I ordered the Italian sub and it was the worst I&#39;ve ever had...and I&#39;ve eaten a lot of Italian subs.  
First, the bread was super stale and chewy.  
Second, the meat tasted like it was packed in salt for the past week.  I don&#39;t remember a time that I was so thirsty after a meal. 
Third, a whole raw onion on a sandwich?  Come on...
Fourth, the vinaigrette was very sharp and unappetizing.  They added so much of this vinegar to the sandwich that it pooled in the paper and dripped all over the place.  
I had taken the sandwich to go, so I wasn&#39;t in a position to complain to the staff. 
 
The rock and roll decor inside is a ripoff of Portillo&#39;s, is way too corny and looks antiquated...not in a good way.  The staff was quick and efficient, but other than that, not a fan at all.  
I suggest they go to a real Italian deli and try a legitimate Italian sub.  Once they do, they should change meat brands, start using all their bread daily, get a new vinaigrette and make another attempt.  Until this happens, I will not be back."

You come in and order at the front as there is no waitstaff. This can be a bit disconcerting since the large menu is scrawled all over the walls and you are immediately asked for your order when you walk in. Telling the cashier to stand down didn&#39;t help. Also the tables are tiny and don&#39;t offer much room for food, much less napkins or condiments other than salt and pepper. I had a hamburger which was unremarkable. Tasted a lot like Wendy&#39;s burger. The pepper and egg sandwich was bland as well. The best item we had were the onion rings which were of the crumbly breading variety.

The place is all done up in retro 50&#39;s style so lots of cool stuff to look at.  Like their sister location in Carol Stream they have great sammies, salads and sides.  I love the bread they use for their sammies and they don&#39;t cheap out on the toppings.  I can never finish a whole sandwich. I am a huge fan of their bruschetta too.

We have had them cater parties and peeps rave about the food.  Fresh, large portions and it really is homemade.

You really can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu.  Plus, the dudes taking your order are quick but patient and happy to answer questions or customize your order.  It&#39;s not dirt cheap but you get what you pay for.

I went with the southwest chipotle wrap and sweet potato fries ($6.50ish), and my sister ordered the california wrap ($7) and home-made chips. Both wraps were sooo HUGE that neither of us were able to finish (lunch for tomorrow!). My sweet potato fries were a little undercooked, but a few of them had a good crunch...I&#39;d give it another shot. My sister&#39;s chips were delicious! They were topped with parmesan cheeeese. I found my hands reaching onto her plate more often than my own. 

They have a huge menu...subs, sandwiches, burgers, melts, wraps, all ranging from $5-$8! I&#39;ll definitely have to go back and try more!"

Basically, we went into the restaurant in the afternoon to request a loaf of long bread - we buy it on occasion as we love it.  By chance today, we were told they were all out (or on very low reserve), but were waiting for another shipment to come in.  

&#39;Felipe&#39; asked for our number and said he would contact us if the second shipment came in.  We gave him our number and didn&#39;t think much of it actually, we actually later in the day were going to just buy bread elsewhere.

20 minutes later, we get a call from the restaurant from Felipe.  We were actually surprised!  The bread had come in and he said he had saved us a loaf!!  I felt this was extraordinary customer service!

ON TOP OF THIS - when we go to pick up the bread, HE GAVE US ANOTHER LOAF FREE!  Wow!

Extraordinary!  Totally worth of a 5 star review for today&#39;s service!   Thank you!"

I walked up to the counter and paid for my order and they handed it to me fresh from the kitchen right after.

Too bad the worker&#39;s outfits don&#39;t match but that&#39;s ok

They are known for their deli, so i gave their meatball sandwich a try, with provolone cheese and a side of french fries and chocolate shake.

I will rate this on 3 things: Service, Food variety, taste

Service: very considerate young people who understood that it was our first time and helped us by answering all our questions (****)

Food Variety: they have burgers, hotdogs, meatball sandwiches, deli sandwiches and more! (****)

Taste: meatball sandwich: you can tell its a blend of meats which is a good thing, but i have had better. the bread is toasted and the sauce is good (***)

chocolate shake: thick, chocolate-but not super sweet, just right, wish it wasn&#39;t super thick though (***)

fries: i love fries, and they must have fried this in a different oil because they look like portillo&#39;s fries but don&#39;t taste like them. Definitely have their own identity. (****)

Overall I give this place a 3.5, but I&#39;ll round up for the service i got

It&#39;s a good change from panera and other sub shops, and doesn&#39;t have the portillo&#39;s fast food feel to it. But it does have a competitor right next door (steak n shake).

Food is ok, not great but it&#39;s good, have to try at least once, especially if you&#39;re a local"

Both the beef and sausage are the among the best tasting I&#39;ve had. At every bite I am reminded just how bland these ingredients have become elsewhere.

[Bite] Delicious! [Bite] Scrumptious! [Bite] Wow!

Maybe not the best in the WORLD ... uh-hem ... but damn, it&#39;s good!

As a side I get their home fried chips. Fresh. Fried. Potato Chips. Yum! (Ya gotta get &#39;em fresh out of the frier -- I&#39;ve gotten half-soggy, lukewarm chips once in a while.) I like &#39;em so much I have yet to try another side. What have I become?!?

They also had a to die for keylime cheesecake (one of my favorite things in the world). They didn&#39;t have it this time when I went in - not sure if they were just out of it or if they stopped carrying it (the last time I was there was literally at least 6 years ago - I remember the last time I went there my friends and I grabbed lunch before going to see &#34;White Noise&#34; at the movie theater, so you have an idea of how long ago that was)

My dad told me what he wanted, and it sounded good so I got the same thing - the build your own burger with grilled chicken breast instead of a burger, cheddar cheese, bacon, grilled onion, tomato, lettuce, and honey mustard with a side of fries. The fries were REALLY good - perfect amount of done-ness, not overly greasy, perfectly salty. mmmm.

The chicken was good, not great. However, I had eaten a huge lunch only a few hours earlier, so I wasn&#39;t really all that hungry - I was planning on eating my dinner later, but it smelled good so I decided to eat it right away. My dad seemed to really like his. There was something a little odd-tasting in my opinion on the sandwich - I think it might have been the honey mustard, but I&#39;m not totally sure. They also really pile on the onions, so I took a few off - no biggie. 

The sandwich itself was HUGE. I ate half of it and saved the rest for the next day (which it still tasted good then, maybe even better. Like I said I wasn&#39;t hungry when I ate it so that&#39;s probably why I didn&#39;t love it). It&#39;s expensive (our two orders were $15 total), but they definitely pile in the food.

Overall it was good, and I will be back. I&#39;d love to try the angus burger (not sure why I didn&#39;t order that in the first place), the vegetable panini, and some of the traditional deli sandwichs."

Great place to get killer Italian Beef. They also make great deli sandwiches any way you like, including some fine pastrami. I like the Italian sub, no oil, extra hot peppers, or the small Greek salad with peppercini peppers on it.

The walls are lined with some real, some fake rock n roll memorabilia, and there are plenty of flat screens around to watch the game, if you&#39;re so inclined. This Augustino&#39;s has a drive through, too.

My only complaint is they charge you for drink refills, which reminds me too much of Portillo&#39;s... But other than that, a worthy destination in the Western Suburbs for beef lovers.

The prices are pretty cheap for the huge amounts you get. I have had the eggplant sandwich and the veggie sub,both are soo tasty! I would probabaly go with the veggie sub next time its so refreshing and topped with tons of veg,lettuce,sprouts,cucs,onions ect.! Opt out of the cheese you dont really need it the rest of the sandwich has so much flavor you dont even need to the cheese or extra calories.

Too bad the worker&#39;s outfits don&#39;t match but that&#39;s ok

They are known for their deli, so i gave their meatball sandwich a try, with provolone cheese and a side of french fries and chocolate shake.

I will rate this on 3 things: Service, Food variety, taste

Service: very considerate young people who understood that it was our first time and helped us by answering all our questions (****)

Food Variety: they have burgers, hotdogs, meatball sandwiches, deli sandwiches and more! (****)

Taste: meatball sandwich: you can tell its a blend of meats which is a good thing, but i have had better. the bread is toasted and the sauce is good (***)

chocolate shake: thick, chocolate-but not super sweet, just right, wish it wasn&#39;t super thick though (***)

fries: i love fries, and they must have fried this in a different oil because they look like portillo&#39;s fries but don&#39;t taste like them. Definitely have their own identity. (****)

Overall I give this place a 3.5, but I&#39;ll round up for the service i got

It&#39;s a good change from panera and other sub shops, and doesn&#39;t have the portillo&#39;s fast food feel to it. But it does have a competitor right next door (steak n shake).

Food is ok, not great but it&#39;s good, have to try at least once, especially if you&#39;re a local"

Both the beef and sausage are the among the best tasting I&#39;ve had. At every bite I am reminded just how bland these ingredients have become elsewhere.

[Bite] Delicious! [Bite] Scrumptious! [Bite] Wow!

Maybe not the best in the WORLD ... uh-hem ... but damn, it&#39;s good!

As a side I get their home fried chips. Fresh. Fried. Potato Chips. Yum! (Ya gotta get &#39;em fresh out of the frier -- I&#39;ve gotten half-soggy, lukewarm chips once in a while.) I like &#39;em so much I have yet to try another side. What have I become?!?

Prices are average for the type of place it is...other than their by the pound salads which I think have astronomical prices attached to them. (hence the 4 rather than 5 stars)  

Also...the teens that work there are not really all that friendly to speak of, but the managers and non-teenage workers are very friendly and make an effort to greet you (especially when you are a regular customer)!  

Would I recommend to a friend: Absolutely!
Would I go again:  Absolutely!  Suddenly I have a hankerin&#39; for an American Sub!"

We ordered the italian sub (mighty tasty), meatball sub(good, but not great) and the kids had grilled cheese and hot dog.   Kids ate their whole meal which is new.

This one has a leg up on the Carol Stream one because of the layout.  Where the Carol Stream location makes you feel like you&#39;ll be shot if you don&#39;t order right, the West Chicago location lets you order at the register in a much less rushed and chaotic environment.

All the good of the Carol Stream location without the bad.  If you have a choice on which to go to, visit West Chicago."

One downside -- if you don&#39;t spend $10 or more, you can&#39;t use your credit card.  Kinda silly in today&#39;s age.

The inside of the deli ain&#39;t much but is decorated with some memorabilia from the good ol&#39; days :D  Well, we came here to eat, right?  Then onto the food ;)

You start out by ordering up front and they will deliver your food to your table.  My friend got the Eggplant Parmesan and I got the Philly Steak Sandwich (both were sub-like buns).  Mine came with fries since it&#39;s a platter (which is basically a plate).  Also got Cheese Styx for both of us.

The Eggplant Parmesan was simply poured onto a single sub-like bun, which the customer is supposed to fold himself.  My friend had a hard time trying to fold it without everything spilling out, especially the parmesan.  He just gave up and ate it like toast.  My Philly was semi-folded on a single sub-like bun, but was much easier to fold.  My sandwich was great.  The Eggplant, besides being unfoldable, was good too.  The Cheese Styx were OK, as long as they were hot.

So as a fast food place I&#39;d say this is a pretty good place to try.  Oh, if you&#39;re gonna order drinks get the biggest one because all sizes cost the same $1 and they don&#39;t do refills (some weird new policy??)"

I went to the West Chicago location. It was good, but I have had better. The bread was good and fresh. The ingredients were just OK, not great. I like it spicy, and had the giardineria, too. A great Italian Sub will have a mixture of salamis, hams and cheeses, lettuce, tomato, plus spices and sauces that all offer some excellent flavors in every bite.

I hate to admit it, but I lived in the area for almost 8 years before trying it.  I did drive through one time, but didn&#39;t see anything on the menu that caught my eye, so I left without ordering.  What a shame at all that time wasted!  

We now go there about once a week, and the food is amazingly good.  I usually get a California wrap, but their Italian beef is also top-notch.  Way better than Portillo&#39;s.  Way better.  Their dogs are great, the grilled cheese is super good too.  Honestly, the only thing I&#39;ve been slightly disappointed with was the meatball sandwich, and that was still good.  I much prefer their homemade chips to the fries, but that&#39;s me.  

The best part about this place though?  The Italian Ice.  If you haven&#39;t tried it, you&#39;re missing out.

The restaurant is set up more like a no frills cafe and true to street style eating we like to order a variety of dishes simply because it is tough to choose just one :) The prices are nominal and the quantity just right.

Whenever here we love to get the Sugarcane Juice, Chaats, Kotto Idly, Kanchipuram Idly, Vada Pav &amp; Mumbai Special Kulfi. The best way to wrap up the meal however would have to be the Sweet Pan - comes free with a Yelp check in. What&#39;s more it seems like they are all set to bring us more treats, new dishes like Kathi Rolls have been introduced.

Visit 1 - 

The girl at the register will not even look at me - while talking on phone with some friend - a full 3 minutes and then casually asked (no sorry for the wait etc)  what will you have !  Then went about putting in the order - yes expectedly - she screwed up or the kitchen -  instead of cheese pav baji - we received cheese DOSA !!  YES !!  and then when I pointed out she offered the Pav - but we were full - refused and she gave a Kulfi !!  But the key -  the total lack of care !  Again even this time - no sincere apology - a simple oh sorry....

Visit 2

This gets better !!  We went in when there was exactly one customer in the cafe !  and the same girl -  I was wondering whats in store - and was not disappointed - this time the order itself was not processed (she did charge me etc)  and left her shift -  and the new guy came -  and we waited a full 20 minutes for a simple gol gapa - and then I approach him - he was - oh I just walked in -  wait I will get you -  again not even a cursory sorry galthi ho gaya !!    and no offer to even compensate for wasting 20 minutes of 2 people !!  Saving grace the kitchen staff who gave it said in a friendly manner - sir tell me if you need extra pani !!!  LOL

To start off, the lady at the register(not sure if she is the owner) is such a sweetheart! This was our first time here after trying the restaurant next door the week before, and we were very excited. The lady was so welcoming and made us feel so good there! She made us a sweet paan at the end that is said to aid in digestion - and it was delicious! 

We ordered a masala dosa which was so delicious that we had to get another one right after. The dosa was so fluffy and warm and not at all dried out like we had had before. It was all just perfect 100%. We also ordered the mumbai pulav and a chicken dish(I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t remember the name and I cannot find the name of it on the menu online). Anyway, both dishes were super good!!!! They were so flavorful and all of the spices complemented each other so well. The food is a bit spicy, but that is the way we like it! If you want it less spicy, we were informed they can adjust to your tastes if you just ask. 

The prices are super affordable, and I&#39;m almost positive that these are the best prices you will find this awesome quality of food in the area. 

The atmosphere is very chill and comfortable. There are plenty of tables to be seated at. Also, there are couches to sit at while you wait for your order or to come hangout.

Great place, one of the best! We definitely will be coming back soon.

So off we headed on a Sunday afternoon.  There were a few people there but there was no one in line as everyone was already seated and enjoying their food.  We grabbed the table near the TV. 

We ordered a plethora of dishes (grilled sandwich, pav bhaji, bhel puri, vada pav, sev puri, and chikoo shake).  Everything practically came out one by one, which gave us a chance to enjoy each item on its own.

The stars of the show were the grilled sandwich and the bhel puri, although we all agreed everything was delicious.

I don&#39;t understand the service issues mentioned by the other Yelpers because the young lady that took our order was as pleasant as can be.  Also, the lady who made our food served it with a smile, so I guess y&#39;all just went on an &#34;off&#34; day?

Also, check-in on Yelp for 2 free sweet paan, tasty and made when you order them.

The lady came to the counter to answer a phone order. I was waiting for her to get done with the phone order - she was right in front of me. Once she was done with phone, she just went back - no eye contact - no courtesy questions - shoddy attitude. Learn to treat customers properly

The lady taking the order is one of the rudest people I have ever met. Maybe this kind of customer service works in India but she&#39;s absolutely the worst. Almost like she&#39;s doing you a favor by taking an order and she places the change on the counter (super rude).

Food: It&#39;s good not great. Of course you can&#39;t compare it to India (Mumbai) ever dor you won&#39;t eat any Indian food in Chicagoland. Do find the specialty drinks, ice creams and desserts to be little pricey.

There is no such a system in order taking it takes more than 30 minutes for them to deliver a simple order. Plus they don&#39;t remember what you order on your order and they have ask you what your order was what kind of system is this??
 What irritates me most is the lady who is always on the a cashier is the rudest person I have ever met on this  earth in my life. She should take classes For  what customer service means and what it is in order for you to gain the business.  I think she would grow far better business if she knew that plus she does not know how to take care of a customer or how to talk to customers in general.  She may think that she&#39;s so all good because she can call out people yeah maybe but you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re causing your business because the way you were talking to customers.  I have seen this over and over at this branch it is nothing but rudest way of talking to customers  I don&#39;t even know how the people take this from her. I personally can&#39;t stand her so that&#39;s why even If I went with family or friend I send them to order bcz I know If she says something i and her will have argument just knowing me how I can&#39;t take wrong stuff. Especially when I know I&#39;m right. 

Food don&#39;t even talk about the food it was very good taste when it started but now the taste is very very very horrible in fact they don&#39;t even fill in their food properly. When I say fill In I mean pack puri have 1 chanyo and 1 small potato ??? WTF?? Shit quality and on top no quantity ? It&#39;s rip off

You know what I don&#39;t have more time to spend on this it&#39;s not worthy time.

and i started going there more often... and ever since the kind of service and quality of things they provide has gone down the drain... Kulfi wayyy too sweet, pan - very very marginal, hygiene level its horrible (place is always super dirty), they give out numbers but no clue how they are serving out, they pretend to make fresh pav bhaji over there whereas all they are doing is reheating it (not even that on sunday, i got it straight of the tawa and it was ICE COLD, shame).... Only consistent thing has been shaved iced dessert which i can get any may places... So this one is off my list...

Does it live up to the expectation? Don`t think so. And yes...the name does no justice to the great city of Mumbai!! 

First Food-  
Vada Pav Just about average
 Pani Puri - will not order it again 
Bombay Grill Sandwich - Don`t get fooled by the name!!! 
Sugarcane Juice - Tasted like they added a spoonful of sugar syrup. The sweetness needs to come from sugarcane itself not from some chemicals.
Falooda- Mehh not at all exciting
Gola -  They got this horribly wrong!! If you have had 1 in Mumbai, please do not compare it with what they serve here. You will be disappointed.
Pan - Saving grace!! loved it.
Ohh BTW good luck navigating through the menu!! 
After all these setbacks, did not try anything else.

Second - Service and Ambiance
They take the order like any fast food restaurant and give you the food by calling out the name of the dish. Now there were 3 people for vada pav.. grab yours before someone else stakes their claim on it. There is a order number on the receipt do not wait for it to be called out. The guys working there are pretty good, but the process is not.
Ambiance - Good idea, bad execution. When you have the space for another 20 people to sit, they do not need a lounger sofa for someone to doze off on. 
It needs more chairs and tables so that people are not standing and staring at someone`s meal..glad I did not get a stomach ache or give one (hopefully) !!
The tables needs to be cleaned properly.. no extra chutneys for me please.
Guy does his job well, but he is understaffed. 

Its a tad expensive cafe...and certainly does not make up for it by food or anything else. 

One of the most standout items- they need is a trash can which can swallow a Styrofoam plate not just a cup. It will be a sound investment. 

Score Card
Food - 5.5/10
Service Ambiance - 5/10
Value for money - 5/10

Will have to be convinced to give it a try or spread the good word.

Good Luck to the team there."

Looks pretty neat as of now and I am hoping it stays like this.

First things First: They need to have trash cans. The ones they have cannot fit Styrofoam plates in them and can only be used for napkins, bottles etc,.  I absolutely did not like how there were used trays with leftover food sitting on various tables for long.

Few things I liked: their samosa chaat was pretty good, well balanced with their in-house chutneys. I also enjoyed their dahi puris a lot. 

Wada Pao: This was very basic. I wish they served chutney on side and some fried chillies. But a very mediocre preparation, nothing special.

It was not the same with Pani Puris. These were not as crunchy and the kanji(the gol gappa water) was bland. 

Worst was the Bombay sandwich: it was so soggy that fell apart as picked from the plate. This when I ate in India, we had option of grilling the sandwich, which is fine, I could have liked it, if it stayed in place. The bread was extremely wet with chutneys and potatoes were bland. I would not recommend this to anyone. 

Paans: My husband tried the meetha paan and he liked it, so I guess after dinner we could hit this place for paans pretty often.

Sugarcane juice: Loved it! Please go for some refreshing gingery &#34;ganne ka ras&#34;.

All in all, it&#39;s worth trying but nothing extraordinary.

The owners did not engage in conversations but looked pretty nice. I also saw same person who took our order, came and cleaned some tables. This place has a lot of room to improve and I hope they do, we need CHAAT joints."

Paan is really nice. 

If u r bored at home and don&#39;t want to cook anything, u don&#39;t want to go to any South Indian restaurant and don&#39;t want to eat a full punjabi meal, then this place is good.. 

Just go with bunch of friends and eat some chaat/bombay shahi sandwich then have coffee ..  Have fun !!

The food is absolutely very tasty and it tastes like homemade food. We love Neelu, the owner, who provides excellent service to her customers. She treats customers just like her family members. If you are in Chicago area, you MUST visit Mumbai Café. During our stay in Chicago, we went there at least for one meal everyday. Sudha, the master Chef, is amazing and can customize the food to your taste. The Café has a good variety of menu options. You can expect to enjoy whatever you select from their menu.

Overall, Mumbai Café is a lovely restaurant for a nice Indian lunch or dinner. We really enjoyed the food here and the price is very reasonable. Neelu, thank you for the delicious food and the absolutely the best service you provide to your customers. We would love to visit your restaurant again!"

Next for dessert, I ordered paan, for curiosity I ordered rabdi paan and it did not taste like rabdi paan at all. He just added rabdi to a meetha paan and charged $3.00!

I usually don&#39;t write bad reviews. But honestly we had Bombay 3 layer sandwich which is nothing more than just cheap walmart white bread and very little green chutney, potato, cucumber, tomato, onion and cheese spread on top. My wife makes 1000 times batter than this at home. Very disappointing sandwich. Then we had bhel which was total soggy and no spicy or sweet chutney. Total dry. Then we had dabely and the color was good but if you ask me about test then forget it. Me and my other three friends also agree. I feel very bad to write review like this. But you guys can try it.... What to loose and hit like if you think I am wright. We are very good promoting new business, but there has to be consistency and quality food. Anyway I hope owners will find this review as a chance to improve while new customers are still coming to explore first time and as everybody says first impression is the last impression. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the owners were so nice and  genuine people. Lastly I think they have nice ice golas and pan. At the End I can say is Good Luck !!"

Vada paav was cold(hot would have been way better, bombay sandwich is terrible, PANI PURI (Gol Gappe) - Totally NOT recommended(they give diluted jaljeera water), dahi batata puris were all empty puris with no stuffing, Pav Bhaji - extra spicy which basically destroyed the taste! Kulfi and Gola are just OK,dabeli was cold uncooked(stuffed with ham burger bun).

As this establishment is new, we decided to stop in. The place was bustling and we placed our order, which was 1 dubley burger and 3 three-layered sandwich. While picking up our order, I requested glasses for water and the cashier&#39;s response shocked me. The owner stated that we can &#34;buy&#34; water bottles and that there is no cooler or water fountain available. Health wise, this opportunity to &#34;make more money&#34; will come at the cost of Mumbai Cafe&#39;s customers. Around 60 percent of our body is water, therefore, in order to digest food, water is a pertinent necessity.  Having no access to water, depresses our appetite and we eat less, a fact that this establishment has, perhaps, not considered. If we eat less because there is no water to process food, we will buy less of the food at Mumbai Cafe. I am an able bodied healthy individual, what if I needed water to swallow my medicine? What if I was at all sick in any form? dehydrated? In my case, I was parched and required some fluid between my snack and chai. Not having public access to water for Mumbai Cafe&#39;s customer not only does my culinary experience disservice, it causes loss of appetite for its customers. Since I have to pay extra for water, I will eat less and therefore, will not frequent the establishment or chose not to come at all. Having water is a public necessity and cheapens the experience of Mumbai Cafe&#39;s customers, since I won&#39;t be staying in a location where I can&#39;t finish a conversation because I am thirsty. This practice of &#34;dehydration-for-profit&#34; needs to be thoroughly reconsidered by Mumbai Cafe because if they can not provide a basic necessity, such as public accessible water, the customers will go elsewhere."

Let&#39;s just say its had a lot of ups and downs. We first started going because of the great lunch deal. Over time that deal has become more sub-par but we still go. Only for one reason, the food is actually pretty good. Of all the Mexican restaurants in the area, they are probably my favorite when it comes to the food. 

The service on the other hand is a joke. A few years ago it was good, but as of recent its been nothing but horrible.In fact a handful of my friend&#39;s just plain won&#39;t go because the service is so bad. Recently a single guy runs the entire place (probably because they don&#39;t get many customers over lunch), he is terrible. He&#39;s rude, slow and just everything that&#39;s wrong with service. In fact he has argued with people in our party before over the lunch special.He gets really angry when you ask him what the lunch special is.

Recently they swapped out the old furniture for some really crappy used furniture and opened up a second side to the restaurant. I&#39;m not even sure why they expanded, I can&#39;t ever recalling more than 1 other table having people at it when we&#39;ve been there in the past. It&#39;s especially surprising seeing that Noodles right next door is always packed. 

If the food wasn&#39;t decent and the price wasn&#39;t fair then I would never go back. But I keep going back once every other week because the food is actually good and I crave the chorizo tacos with the chips and ranch dip."

First of all, the food is subpar. My chile rellenos were mushy and watery. They also only stuff them with cheese here so they were pretty plan. The rice is the equivalent of white rice with a splash of yellow food coloring and the retried beans taste like they came from a can. 

The service here sucks and the only thing worth coming for are the margaritas which taste good but have minimal booze in them. The last time I came here the waitress was rude and acted like we were an inconvenience. None of us got the salt or sugar rims on our margaritas that we ordered. Mine did get a special garnish though. I pulled out a piece of the bartenders hair. When I told the waitress she asked me if I was sure it wasn&#39;t mine (which was back in a ponytail with a head band, longer and lighter colored). She finally offered to replace it for me but still charged me for it. I was annoyed that she suggested I would complain about my own hair. She also was annoyed we asked for separate checks (we were there with our book club). 

So why not give them one star? The margaritas have good flavor... Just make sure yours doesn&#39;t have an extra &#34;garnish&#34;!"

My sister and I came here about a year and a half, two years ago and the service was poor at best.  I requested a Patron margarita, I received a margarita with what was CLEARLY well tequila (i.e. the cheapest bathtub tequila one can find).  Rest assured, the server charged me for the Patron.  They serve a white ranch dip with their chips and salsa which is probably the least Mexican food item I can think of.   An employee&#39;s child loudly played nearby.  It was a terrible experience.  

But, everyone has a bad day and apparently I&#39;m a glutton for punishment because I went back there thinking they got their stuff together and listened to customer complaints and improved.  NOPE!  I walked in and the server (who appeared to be the only person working front of house) was standing directly in front of me waiting on one of two occupied tables.  Two men came in behind me.  The server finally acknowledged us and said &#34;sit anywhere you want&#39;.  Okay, thanks for the friendly greeting.  I sat down, waiting for my menu.  Nothing.  I finally see the server bring the two men who came in behind me their chips, salsa and Lay&#39;s Ranch Dip and ask if they&#39;re ready to order.  Huh?  I stood up to leave and said &#34;Excuse me, just so you know, I was here before they were&#34; and walked out.

Businesses need to worry less about reviews on Yelp and worry more about serving their customers in a way that doesn&#39;t get them a poor review.  Never again.

**Side Note:  To the person below named Melissa who asked for her fajitas not to be cooked in butter or oil but got oily fajitas...how the f**k do you think fajitas get made??  I&#39;m sorry, but that has to be the silliest request I&#39;ve ever seen."

Drinks: SANGRIA and MARGARITAS! Every single time I go!

The staff is amazing and you see them working their tail fethers off to serve everyone. The place is small so it can fill up fast so get there early to get a seat on busy nights. Also check out the amazing lunch and dinner speicals (and drink specials). You can never go wrong with them!"

It was busy but we were able to get a couple of seats at the bar and were warmly welcomed by Victor.  He was very helpful with the drink menu and even gave me a taste portion of a drink he thought I would love.  I did, and would have ordered it but I decided on the Bloody Maria-which was outstanding!  Victor also helped with the food menu-everything we ordered was also great!

The bartenders/severs are always really nice. The drinks are on point. I love the margarita with the champagne. Talk about fancy! 

I ordered the plate with a taco, enchilada, and a flauta. I of course had to have a steak taco. It was flavorful and good. The chicken enchilada was ahhhhhhmazing. The chicken had so much flavor! I want one right now actually. The flauta was equally delicious. 

And let&#39;s take a minute to talk about the sauce with the tacos. OMG so goood!! I want it by the bottles lol. I&#39;ve never had a sauce that tasted like that. 

I recommend you head up there stat! Also you cannot beat a $3.00 house margarita which might now be served in an actual margarita glass, but who really cares in the grand scheme of things. You&#39;re still getting a really good margarita for 3 bucks!"

Enchiladas were falling apart soggy. The verde sauce tastes like it came out of a can. The ground beef has carrots in it, where is this beef from? When I saw the steak I couldn&#39;t differentiate it from the ground beef. It&#39;s super chewy and fatty. So disappointed. I won&#39;t be back."

Food was amazing, very flavorful and fresh.  To get my meal started I got the most interesting margarita in the world - that thing was huge (see pic).

Tortilla chips + salsas was a nice side kick to hold us over.

We got 3 taco plate (chicken, chorizo, el pastor) authentic style w/ corn tortilla.  As a surprise appetizer we got complimentary tortilla soup which tasted great and fresh!  Then came the tacos, in one word: tasty!  My favorite was chorizo.

Then came the bill, despite us getting drinks it was still very reasonable.

The close location was great, too.

We pulled up and, from the outside, couldn&#39;t tell if it was open or just empty.  Blame the tint on the windows, because once inside we saw they were open and we weren&#39;t alone either.  The place looks really nice inside, like a cozy corner not a dive, 3 a.m. drunk taco stop.

We weren&#39;t in the mood to drink so we just got cokes, but all of the margaritas look amazing.  Better try them next time (and there will be a next time).  They also had mexican coke in glass bottles for those interested.

We came in hungry, so we decided to split the queso fundito (?) which proved to be a great choice.  We didn&#39;t use the tortillas it comes with but rather just dipped our chips in it.  The meat and cheese were both tasty.  The chips and salsa were up to snuff as well.

For our meals my friend got quesadillas and i got my standard steak tacos.  I wish I had known how big the tacos were, because I couldn&#39;t finish my meal and would&#39;ve ordered less.  But now I know for next time.  The tacos didn&#39;t wow me, but they were still good.  As we walked out I realized they had your typical green and red sauces in the bottom of the drink fridge but never brought them out to us.  That might&#39;ve helped improve my tacos as well.

Let&#39;s give this a shot... 

I&#39;m a gringo and the way I know any restaurant is good is by the level of service I receive and the quality of the food as soon as my meal is concluded. If there are others eating there the food might be good (shocker, there were). Non gringos might feel their food is good too (wish I could comment on authenticity but I&#39;m a gringo that&#39;s never gone anywhere outside a resort town in Mexico). The rice was cooked perfectly. The chorizo was normal ol&#39; chorizo (yum), al pastor was so ridiculously tender and juicy that I&#39;d wish I&#39;d ordered more for the road and the carnitas were tender and juicy but could&#39;ve used a bit more flavor. The refried beans I&#39;ve known and loved all my life tasted like the same ones I&#39;ve had everywhere else, I&#39;m a fan of black personally but you won&#39;t find me complaining. The waitresses appeared to be having a good day and well I&#39;m selfish... because whether they were or weren&#39;t doesn&#39;t quite matter so much to me, their service and attitude was great throughout. I can&#39;t speak about the bartender because she didn&#39;t serve me but the patrons occupying her stools appeared to be in good spirits *ba dum tsh*. The taco stand that occupied this space before is no longer an operating business.

I&#39;m glad Maria&#39;s decided to fill the void in my food heart that is this little strip mall. I can now get my fix of Chinese, Mexican, or Pizza without having to think hard about what I want prior to leaving the house. Anyhow... A+++ would nom nom nom again. Thanks for a good experience and delicious food.

The games weren&#39;t on so i asked the manager if he can change to the games and put them side by side and he did them without any questions.

But food wise. I had the best tacos i have ever had in the suburbs. And the spicy mango margarita was out of this world. The place is affordable, and most of all, tasteful. The staff was amazing. They provide such great service. They always made sure our food and drinks were great. 

The bar its self is very nice. It has a modern sports bar feel with a relax vibe to it. Awesome TVs and awesome design."

I have frequented this establishment almost daily since it opened not only to try out the menu but because everyone who works there is friendly and inviting. Many restaurants claim fresh food, but Maria&#39;s is hands down the best in this area. Made to order fresh Mexican food is hard to come by, and in my opinion, Maria&#39;s is spot on. Portion sizes are very generous which makes for this big guy with a big appetite very happy, but can also serve as a nice meal to share or even for leftovers.  Fresh squeezed fruit cocktails (margaritas and mojitos!),  4 Mexican beers on draft and a friendly staff who are always smiling makes for a wonderful experience. My humble recomendations are as follows. Appitizer: Elote (Mexican Grilled corn) served with tortilla chips. Lunch: Torta (Mexican sandwich) with choice of meat. Dinner: Many to choose from but I will say the Burrito Suizo. *note: very large portion*. There are many more delicious food to try and I recommend trying them out for yourselves.  I have heard some complaints about the lack of a extremely spicy sauce but a restaurant can&#39;t try to kill people with heat.  The spice level is fine and people who don&#39;t like spicy food can feel very comfortable eating here.  I am also quite sure the kitchen can whip up a &#34;fire sauce&#34; upon request. Overall, this newest edition to the area will be the talk of the town soon because the level of service combined with fresh food quality will be a sure success. And by the way, to the other person who posted, I was born in Mexico and love the food here."

With that said, mine and my girlfriends food was cold when it was served. Not warm, but actually cold. they did offer up new food, but by the time it arrived everyone else was done eating.

Time of my visit: Lunch time

I decided to go to this place based on Yelp! reviews.  There is a huge selection of different options, I chose Hug Heaven.  I had an option of hot or cold, I picked cold and it came with the chips.  I also ordered large iced tea.  Right from the top, I was told, it would be just one free refill (I really appreciated that).  I reached out to pay with my AMEX and was told they did not accept it.  Sorry, but this is such a pet peeve of mine, either accept them all or be a cash only, this selected cards only is none-sense to me.

It did not take long for them to get me my food. While waiting I did notice there was a price difference between what was in the menu and what I was charged.  It was not a big difference, but nonetheless could be a bit confusing.  When my lunch arrived, the sandwich did not look all that big (size wise), maybe a little over 6 inches in length.  Chips were your typical, out of the bag, big brand chips, I was hoping for home style, home made chips.  The sandwich was not anything spectacular or out of this word, your typical deli sandwich, warmed up.  The bread was too soft for my liking.  Overall, I was not all that impressed and for pennies under $10, I was expecting a heck lot more.

I must comment and compliment on three things, efficiency, the food came out fast.  The cleanness, the place looked like you could eat off the floor.  The service, the service was awesome!  The lady behind the counter, the lady who brought out my food, both were very polite, sweet and nice.

However, C- is the best I can do.  It&#39;s almost not worth a drive for me on my lunch."

Located in the strip mall on Lake St., it wasn&#39;t hard to find and sits nicely among the other businesses.

Upon entering to meet Jacqueline B. for lunch, I was greeted sweetly by the lady at the counter. I wouldn&#39;t say the menu is overwhelming but there is a LOT to choose from. You&#39;re not weird if you need to ask for a minute to browse through all of the different types of hot and cold sandwiches and the rest of the menu. I picked up a bottle of water from the open refrigerated section by the counter, ordered myself a chicken pesto asiago panini and took a seat. It was immediately in the middle of a lunch rush so I&#39;m surprised I had gotten a table! This place gets crowded!

I have very few preferences and opinions when it comes to food so I thought my panini was a-ok to me. All paninis come with a side of chips which doesn&#39;t sound very filling but the sandwich was actually larger than I had thought it would be. The chicken was pretty scarce within the sandwich but the panini bread made up for it. The prices were what I expected (and had read from previous reviews). The prices are definitely comparable to a Panera lunch.

The one qualm I have about Crave is that from the chatter and conversations as well as the music throughout, it was really difficult to hear the lady say the order when your meal was ready. From the ambience and looks of the place, I had honestly thought your order gets brought to your table - especially because there is outdoor seating. It may be really inconvenient for those outdoor customers to peek in-and-out to see if their food is ready.

Overall, the space was nicely decorated, very clean and had a nice rustic look to it with the warm colors and dark wood. The employees were really sweet and really take care of the place from the looks of it.  I&#39;d love to visit again and try more on the large menu!"

Unfortunately no stars for the food itself. I really hate giving bad reviews but their food is nothing spectacular. Perhaps I had too much expectations given that this place was 4.5 out 5 stars (33 reviews). It was a total let down for me. I do appreciate the variety of sandwiches they offer. 

They advertise fresh soup which maybe it was but the taste was bland. I had the mushroom soup and it was bland with big slices of mushrooms. 

I asked for their most popular sandwich and the lady said it was the chicken pesto panini. The bf had that and I had the Cuban panini. The chicken pesto was bland with tasteless chicken and same with the pork in the Cuban sandwich. Both meats were tasteless and it could&#39;ve been more tender. The bread... Have you ever had a sandwich that hurt the top of your palate because the bread was too hard??? Yep, the bread on this one surely didn&#39;t make the cut either. I ended up taking out the meat and leaving the bread uneaten. 

The Cuban panini came with seasoned fries. $8.95. The meat filled half of the sandwich, but then again if you don&#39;t enjoy the taste, why have more of it?  Not worth it. Chicken pesto panini came with chips. $8.99. Not worth it either.

Crave Cafe is one of the good choices. The small café has about 10 tables and it&#39;s half full at lunch time on a Saturday. The menu reminds me of Panera Bread, with sandwiches (hot and cold), soup, salads, but there are also at least 5 different kinds of burgers and some &#34;south of the border&#34; choices. 

I decided to go with the special of the day: fish tacos with fries. Each of the 3 tacos had a good-sized well-seasoned fresh-off-the-grill tilapia fillet, not small pieces of unidentified fish like many other fish tacos. I devoured all of them. The crispy fries were the best I&#39;ve had in a long time. If the weather was cooler, I would have tried one of their homemade soups. 

The San Antonio Burger he (by he, I mean my spouse of choice) got was a little messy to eat due to the BBQ pulled pork, but he said it&#39;s yummy. 

Prices are on a par with fast casual restaurants, but you can expect more of &#34;made from scratch&#34; here.

I got the Asian Chicken Salad for about $8. The size is good, ginger dressing is delicious but my salad is FROZEN. 

Yes, FROZEN. It took the guy all but 3 seconds to put it in a bag for takeout which must mean that they are premade. In any case, a frozen salad is not a salad. All the lettuce is frozen and the chicken as well. That said, the menu said &#34;grilled chicken&#34; and I had hoped it would be warm. Or at least room temperature, or edible.

 The sandwich was bland, lacking real character.   I know you say it&#39;s a turkey sandwich - what did you expect Vince?  There was nothing exciting in the sandwich - the turkey was boring, bacon basic and the spicy mayo lacked zip.    

The chili saved the lunch.   It was smoky, full of meat and was an excellent rendition of chili.   I&#39;d go back for this by itself and try something different on the menu.

This is a cute, super clean, friendly and tasty, sandwich shop.  They offer a wide array of sandwichs, pannini&#39;s, burgers, salads.  They have pastries and a breakfast menu.  They serve Coca-Cola products from the fountain, but they also have a cooler with water, juice and Pepsi products as well.  This cafe is just west of Caputo&#39;s in the Georgetown Shopping Center in Bloomingdale.  

 First of all, this place is immaculate, clean, bathrooms were spotless, shiny, attractive artwork and a fragrant aroma.  Floors were spotless.  Attendant was very helpful and for only an additional twenty cents I upgraded to a meal for my Bleu burger with carmelized onions.  Food came quickly to our table, the french fries, which I almost didn&#39;t order were fantastic.  Owner buys a seasoned fry, pays extra, but they were crispy, tasty and golden brown.  Just the way I like them.   The sandwich, which only cost $5.29 was GOURMET all the way.  Bleu cheese, was so tasty and not an incredibly strong bite, perfect for my tastes.  The Bleu cheese is a Stella&#39;s product which is an excellent brand of food.  Owner goes high end with all of his food orders, pays extra for a higher quality of food.  

Atmosphere was pleasant, they had a nice run of lunch customers which were taken care of quickly.  We were able to relax, no hustle and bustle, here,   Great mood to enjoy  friends and good food.  Not noisy like many restaurants.  

Be prepared to have a great experience with your cravings at Crave Cafe.  Five stars, period!!!!   Great place to pop in after your dance workout or weight training session or visit to Caputo&#39;s,  stop in and satisfy your cravings."

I had time to burn while waiting for the significantly better half to finish up at an event in Elgin so I planned on stopping in to another coffee shop downtown.
With construction detours, I got turned around, redirected, lost and, unsurprisingly, a tad annoyed.
As I got close to where I thought I wanted to go, I grabbed the first street parking spot I saw.
After dusting off my seriously rusty parallel parking skills, I noticed that i had parked about 50 feet away from a different coffee shop/cafe.
The second thing I noticed was the huge free parking lot across the street. DOH!

As I approached it, I saw that he uses Lavazza, which I like, so, bonus.

I poked my head in to take a look before committing.

There wasn&#39;t a clutch of guys in the corner, clearly regulars, holding court, shooting the breeze.
The owner was behind the counter and his daughter was running the register.
And the guy was talking with everyone in the place. And EVERYONE who came in got a very genuine Good Morning!
The place is small. 5 tables with 2 chairs each, and some stools at a counter.

I had a large mocha which was very good. He uses better syrups, so there isn&#39;t any weird aftertaste like some other places.
I also indulged in a breakfast sandwich, eggs, ham, cheese pressed in a panini press.
The bread was excellent. He uses Italian rolls which crisp up really well in the press.
Next time I&#39;ll have him slap some roasted peppers or giardinera on the sandwich to really feed the need.

This is clearly a neighborhood joint. People know each other, greet each other. The vibe is very congenial.  After I was done with the breakfast sandwich and coffee, Leo, the owner, stopped over to clear the dishes and introduce himself.  A brief chat and he was back behind the counter helping the next batch of patrons.

This place was exactly what I was looking for on a slow Saturday morning.

I&#39;ll definitely be back.
I recommend dropping in, say hi to Leo, and soak in the atmosphere a bit."

It is now the Domani Cafe, which opened in 2009.  We were immediately greeted by the owner, Leo, who served as barista and made us some scrumptiously caffeinated drinks just as quick as they pump &#39;em out at Starbucks, if not quicker. Leo was so nice and likable that it made me glad to give him our business!

We ordered a large Latte, a Chai Tea Latte, and an almond poppyseed muffin and grabbed a little table outside on the sidewalk. Everything was perfect. Drinks were delicious and muffin was yummy. They use Ghirardelli syrup (nice!), and they tasted like very high quality drinks. Reasonable prices too. Total was only $10, which I&#39;m guessing is about $2-3 less than what that order would be at Starbucks.

I really loved the atmosphere too. Cute little rustically designed cafe with outdoor seating , which was exactly what I was missing from my chain coffee classics.

The latte I got was sweet but very watery; I would have a hard time calling it coffee as I tasted no espresso whatsoever, it was more akin to syrup water. I liked the inside; it was quaint, but somewhat disappointing as far as the selection of sweet, although the sandwich menu did look decent, for non-vegetarians. I am a big coffee enthusiast and I saw nothing particularly special about this place; the prices reflect the quality; mediocre, the place reminded me a bit of a small cafeteria. I wish this place luck but I am sticking to other places with much stronger brews, better selections and very high quality."

Leo IS the atmosphere. He absolutely makes the place - always chatting it up with regulars. Tip: introduce yourself. He&#39;ll call you by name the entire time you&#39;re there. 

Only one drawback: no wifi. I probably would have stayed twice as long otherwise. Plan to bring a book and enjoy a quiet few minutes.

Since it was a million outside today, I ordered an iced tea with my lunch. I did so with some reservation as I&#39;ve found that coffee shops, while invariably serving what they purport to be iced tea, do so often as what seems to be an afterthought, instead focusing on much more sophisticated sounding drinks. 

Instead, Domani&#39;s iced tea turned out to be some of the best in the league, clearly brewed with expertise.

This simple recommendation gave me the idea to see if all Chai Tea Lattes were this good or if Leo was on to something. I have not found anything as delicious as this drinks. His drinks are very sweet and never watery.

However, trying to decide between all three of us where we were going to eat, was a challenge.

Brock: Tell me to either turn left or right; just direct me to food.

With that minimum instruction I came across this little hidden gem.  There would have been a slim chance I would have found this on my own, but we are thankfully in the GPS days - dinner was saved!

The all you can eat sign was like a beacon in a foggy storm.  It was perfect for two grown men and myself.  $24?  Can&#39;t beat that!

The place was crowded when we got a table, and the walls were covered with customers filled sushi tables and huge smiles.  Really awesome.

The staff is legit Japanese, and the green tea was probably the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The all you can eat is lethal - you better get your money worth; get there starving like us, and you&#39;ll be so thrilled!  Roll after roll was excellent!  We loved the fresh roll options more than the cooked, but man, they were fresh!  Clean tables and floors, and they never rushed us to leave.

I have been here 3 times because I love their all you can eat special but all three times the women serving us has been ridiculously rude and overbearing.

The second time I was there, it was a party of seven adults. We ordered about 24 rolls. She came back to us and told us we ordered 36 and it was too much and that she would charge $1 per piece left. We told her its fine and to just keep it coming. She purposely brought us one roll at a time, telling us she&#39;s slowing service because we ordered too much. We were the only ones in the resturant at the time so its not because they were busy. Every time she bought us a plate she repeated that we ordered too much, that she would charge us and that we had 30 left (Which was obviously not true because we ordered less than that initially).

Every. Single. Time. 

We were all so sick of her that we just told her to cancel the rest of the rolls and we left. This is an ALL YOU CAN EAT place last time I checked and 3 rolls a person is not excessive.

All three times I went there she was like this. Needless to say I have not been back nor will I be going back. 

The sushi was good but not enough to deal with this woman."

I&#39;ve visited twice since my last review.. Maki (roll) presentation is clean/attractive and portions are good. They haven&#39;t been heavy on the rice the last two times I&#39;ve visited; ingredients are much more balanced. Ingredient quality is also decent.

Oh, and it&#39;s a cute, clean space (bathrooms included). It&#39;s Japanese-owned, which I was surprised about, since all the ones I&#39;ve been to have Chinese or Korean owners and/or employees.


The Meh:
Service is slow when they aren&#39;t even that busy (tonight at 8:30 it was 3 tables of 2-5, including ourselves). We were seated for about 10 minutes before we got our AYCE sheets, and had to ask for them. Apparently you now have to ask for the (super salty!) miso soup, too. They&#39;re stingy with wasabi and ginger, again, unless you ask. Good luck flagging down the owner(&#39;s wife?), though - she&#39;s often behind the counter and doesn&#39;t really scan the dining area. She&#39;s not very welcoming or warm, but I feel she&#39;s a teensy bit more attentive after you&#39;ve been there for a bit.

The pictures on the menu are a general representation (stock photos?), but we&#39;ve been surprised (sometimes pleasantly, sometimes not) by some variations. This last visit we shared 6 rolls between the two of us and it was perfect. We typically get the Tempura and Fresh variety, and skip over the Hot/Cooked ones.


To Sum:
&#34;A-OK&#34;: we only come here if we can&#39;t make the hour round-trip drive to a different (and $6 cheaper per person) AYCE sushi joint."

It&#39;s tucked back in  a strip mall and just says &#34;Sushi&#34;  that is visible Lake Street. Looks a little sketchy- but don&#39;t judge a book by its cover!

We had been going to 8000 mile almost on auto-pilot every time we wanted sushi. BUT NOW we have options! Abashiri offers a much more intimate dining experience and a much wider array of sushi options. It is also much more authentic Japanese cuisine.

Additionally, if you stuff your face with enough sushi, they will automatically roll you over to the unlimited sushi plan. Which is about $25 a person and includes UNLIMITED SUSHI. If you plan on going with the unlimited plan,might as well start and continue with the premium rolls.

Staff is so friendly and attentive-definitely, highly recommend."

The food we ordered included miso soup, which was &#34;meh&#34;. It had maybe a couple of small itty-bitty cubes of tofu and a tiny bit of seaweed, mostly liquid. Maybe it&#39;s because we came there somewhat late, and we were literally getting the bottom of the barrel.

This place had a decent overall rating, most people seemed to really enjoy it, so I figured &#34;it can&#39;t be that bad&#34; and gave it a shot. I ordered 2 rolls and 2 nigiri. The price was almost $50. I couldn&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve been to MANY sushi places and I understand sushi is pricey. But this was crazy especially since I was ordering things like super white tuna and spicy tuna rolls. Nothing fancy really! But, I have needs, so I bit my tongue and paid up. The nigiri was ok, nothing to write home about. The spicy tuna was intolerable. The rice was hard, the tuna was almost non existent and what was there was tasteless and incredibly spongey which is a really strange texture for spicy tuna. Usually I&#39;ll power through and eat it anyway because I really love sushi, but I couldn&#39;t even eat it. I honestly don&#39;t remember what the other roll was that I ordered, but I ate a couple pieces and tossed that one too. I can&#39;t get on the same page with these 4 or 5 star reviews. I wish I could, because this restaurant is so close to my house. The food wasn&#39;t worth the price tag at all. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll even give it another shot. Maybe...

Interior is clean and quaint. When I stopped in for lunch there were a few actual Japanese patrons eating here which was a good sign. The menu is pretty extensive and they have a lot of good lunch combos.  I ordered sushi combo B which came with miso soup. The soup was hot and tasty. My combo came with 5pcs of sushi and I upgraded to spicy tuna roll instead of California roll. Sushi was tasty fresh and well prepared. Service was prompt even with one server handling 6 tables. I will return and possibly try the all you can eat menu.

The husband has taken a liking to sushi and so we are working the circuit. We pulled up in the parking lot on a week night intending on all you can eat sushi. At least that was the plan. 

When we walked in, we were promptly seated and given menus to review. I really liked their bento box options, so I went that route while my husband placed an order for a few rolls to start his AYCE adventure. 

The food took a while. A lot longer than he expected. I was prepared having read the reviews over the years. The waitress was pretty focused which meant that eye contact didn&#39;t really mean anything. If you want something, ask for it when she&#39;s at the table. She was the only one working the room, so she was busy. 

The sushi made my husband happy. He filled up way too quickly since the food was taking so long. I enjoyed my teriyaki chicken, the tempura veggies and shrimp, the salad and the California roll. 

When he decided that he just couldn&#39;t eat anymore, we asked for the check and the waitress just charged us for the rolls he ordered instead of the AYCE price since it was less that way. I appreciated that move on her part. I can see going back, but might try for an off time in the hopes that the food hits the table quicker to make the AYCE worth it."

They were as glorious as Simba&#39;s kingdom and then some.

I also like that there&#39;s free green tea with the AYCE special. I hear tell there&#39;s also free miso soup but why fill up on that when you can stuff your face with more sushi? Give me more rolls and then roll me on out the door."

Overall, it actually has been. 

The first time I visited was for a UYE AYCE sushi. I had no idea what to expect but between 7 of us we managed to eat A LOT of sushi. 

For those of you that don&#39;t know the &#34;Yelp Lingo&#34; yet, UYE - Unofficial Yelp Event and AYCE - All You Can Eat. Ughhh....I just became one of THOSE people, who say Lingo. lol

Since the first time and to the last time I visited, it still stands, my favorite is the Lion King roll, I just can&#39;t get enough. Whatever sauce they put on top is on POINT!  My second favorite would have to be the Mango &amp; Tuna rolls. Yummmm-O! (As Rachel Ray would say, is she still around?)

I&#39;d have to say the oddest thing I&#39;ve tried at Abashiri is their shrimp boat.....sounds cool doesn&#39;t it? No, it actually doesn&#39;t. At all. lol

Well, I&#39;m not going to lie, I had to talk myself into eating this. It&#39;s a piece of open faced shrimp, topped with white rice, a quail egg and caviar. NEVER in my life would I have tried that but I&#39;ve learned that in life, you should always try things at least once. So I closed my eyes, inserted the boat in my mouth and closed it. To my surprise it was SOOOOO good! I could not believe that I, Osiris V, liked that slimy quail egg caviar topped thingy. haha But the combination gave it an exquisite flavor. If you visit, you should definitely try it for your selves. 

Just remember, AYCE sushi is only from Monday through Thursday and it runs around $25/pp. Which is not bad at all considering if you order one plate it runs you about 12-14. So it&#39;s very worth it. 

Plus they have really good Japanese beers!

It was Girl&#39;s Night Out and right before Abashiri the 10 of us decided to do a little wine tasting the next town over and after a few wines and good company our bellies started to growl. Well, what&#39;s better than AYCE sushi after a couple glasses of wine? (Although I do recommend doing the reverse so you don&#39;t get &#34;tipsy&#34; at the tasting.) 

Abashiri gladly seated us and stayed patient with us as we struggled on what to order since everything sounded so delicious and there were many first timers. Between the 10 of us we ordered over 30+ rolls and yes, we ate every since piece and our bellies were extremely happy. Unfortunately, due to my hiatus I can&#39;t remember which ones were my favorite, but I do remember I enjoyed the deliciousness of the Fire roll and every piece I ate was fresh.

. I found the list of options for nigiri, fresh rolls, cooked rolls and specialty items impressive.  It&#39;s a shame that I have lived next door for so long I never tried this place. The prices are very reasonable including the lunch and dinner specials, all you can eat sushi, and the bento boxes.

We tried two of the new specialty rolls. The one that stood out the most was the Lambada. We absolutely loved that one.  We also tried the albacore tuna in a specialty roll it was topped with smelt. It was very different, but a little too salty. We each had miso soup which I really enjoyed.

Now that I&#39;m here in Bloomingdale, well, options for any kind of quality eats run scarce. You know the feeling. Yes, YOU DO. It took me two years to finally get my yellow ass to Abashiri, but not for lack of trying.  Luckily, relatives from the Rock were in town and I sprung at the chance to experience this joint. 

It&#39;s small, so claustrophobes beware. At least it&#39;s clean, so claustrophilic clean-freaks, come on down! It appears that Abashiri is actually owned by Japanese people, a weirdly refreshing change from all the Chinese-owned sushi bars in Chicagoland, which explains the more authentic feel and flavor. 

I pigged out because 1) a well-heeled relative was paying, 2) I hadn&#39;t had access to Japanese food for way too long, and 3) I figured I&#39;d work it off later that evening. Whelp, that last one was a bust. Maybe tomorrow. 

I really enjoyed the salmon tempura roll, with its crunchy, flaky bits of salmon and a light drizzle of unagi sauce. No one else would touch my Mexican roll, a fun, punchy riff on a spicy tuna roll that featured the addition of cilantro and chopped jalapeno (seeds included). It made this heat-loving Korean happy, but I have never been so glad to have been prescribed ultra-strength omeprazole. The katsudon was perfect, but perfect, the sweet soy sauce dripping down from the egg-onion-fried pork cutlet raft onto the rice. And in spite of the bones that required the deft kind of chopstick usage that I&#39;ve never managed to master, the salmon shioyaki (&#34;salt-broiled&#34;) was the best I&#39;ve ever had. Plus, if you&#39;re anything like my omnivorous grandpa, you&#39;ll crunch on the bones anyway and say they&#39;re good for your own bones. 

All that said, the sushi did not wow my socks off, and the rice was your standard domestic calrose rice - no super-polished short-grain koshihikari loveliness here - but the food was fresh, tasty and satisfying. I&#39;ll be back if anyone can ever bring my sad, car-less self here again."

For a Wednesday it was popping!! But we got a table :-) Let me tell you, i&#39;ve been to 2 different places where they have unlimited sushi and Abashiri is the best!!! The wide selection of sushi is amazing!!! You can&#39;t find that anywhere else (well i haven&#39;t just yet.) I love Abashiri, if you are thinking about checking this place out, stop reading and go go go! 
I would say try the volcano roll, poor sushi bliss!! :-) 

Also, service is amazing, and the lady waitress was really nice. We were hungry and did not hear before ordering the unlimited that if you do order it you have to eat it all, can&#39;t take it home. If there is leftovers you get charged per roll. Honestly, we did not hear that and the lady was sweet and let us off the hook. 
SO just remember if you want unlimited, order 2 at a time not 5 rolls at a time (NOSHAME) lol!

Happy eating!! Enjoy!

Food:
All you can eat SUSHI ROLLS ($24.95): comes with free miso soup and the overall sushi rolls are good, I enjoyed the crab and lobster meat sushi rolls..

Kalbi Sushi roll.. it&#39;s just a little odd.. I think Sushi is meant for Fish....I guess you can get it if you want some Kalbi in your meal...it&#39;s just ok tasting.. I&#39;d just go to a kalbi place if I was craving kalbi..

Costs: it&#39;s sushi.. so on the higher end..the all you can eat is decent...if you want to try out different rolls, I&#39;d recommend that you just get the all you can eat so your not limited to only 1-2 rolls... if you order 2-3 rolls ... it&#39;ll probably be equivalent to $24.95...so yea.. 

Sushi Rolls ranges from ~$10-$13+ per roll that contain around 6+ pieces?...they are just average sized rolls...thankfully they didn&#39;t stuff my rolls with rice...

Wait time: no wait to get seated...wait for sushi wasn&#39;t too long..

Parking: located in a small strip mall..so you might have to walk a little if there&#39;s limited spots closer to the restaurant (meaning 10 steps to restaurant)... plenty of parking...:)

Atmosphere: it&#39;s sort of small so I wouldn&#39;t come here with a huge huge group, but with around 4 people it would be good...I came during lunch time so I just saw ppl eating here during their lunch break...

**Note: all you can eat is ONLY for Sushi Rolls..and if you have leftovers or can&#39;t finish your food.. they&#39;ll charge you..so be cautious in not ordering too much food that you can&#39;t eat..

It&#39;s good.. maybe I&#39;d come here again for dinner instead of lunch...not a good feeling when you feel like your going to explode (too much eating) + food coma returning to work for another 4 hrs.. which seems like forever! :)"

I went for a friend&#39;s birthday and had a very fun time. However, I&#39;m allergic to shellfish and finding rolls sans shrimp or crab was mighty hard. Nearly all their rolls have some type of shellfish included and if not that had jalapeno. I&#39;d go back to Abashiri but skip the AYCE madness and stick to just ordering a few things on the regular menu. It wasn&#39;t quite worth the price tag for me.

The rolls at Abashiri are a bit smaller than other places, however they offer a good variety of options. It was packed to the brim on the weekend and because of this it would take forever to get our rolls. I&#39;m talking 20 minutes of waiting with no food during our break times. It would be better if they brought the rolls out as they were made instead of waiting for a few &amp; bringing them out together.

All in all, I enjoyed Abashiri but am not rushing to get back. I absolutely would like to go again and try more items from them!"

It has a pretty good selection of sushi and tasty dishes for those who do not like sushi. They have changed a few thing with the all you can eat though, no more sushimi. 

The only negative is that it takes A LONG TIME to get your sushi if they have more than 4 tables of people. They only have two chefs cooking so It will take about 30 minutes an order at least if they are &#34;busy&#34;. 

The servers are very very personable and will joke around with you. They are also very knowledgeable about the different types of rolls and such. 

This is a go to place if your looking for decent all you can eat sushi."

My husband and I went here on a Monday night for AYCE sushi.  At $25/person and the awesome variety of sushi, it was well worth the 40-minute drive for us.  My only hang-up about this place previously was the long wait between rolls.

On a Monday night, there were a few occupied tables, and while the service was a tad slow, it felt faster since there were only two of us.  We split six rolls and left stuffed.  

My favorites are still the Paradise, Godzilla, Mango Tuna, and Crunchy Rainbow.  The Spicy Tuna was a little mushy, and the Mexican is too spicy with the amount of jalapeno and cilantro used, but my husband loves it.

On my previous visit...

Abashiri has all-you-can-eat sushi for $25/person, and that deal includes Friday nights!  I&#39;ve done the AYCE at a few places in the suburbs, places that do it all week, but they don&#39;t do it nearly as well as Abashiri.  Even though there are at least two other spots much closer to home for me, the 45 minute drive to Abashiri was well worth it.

I went here for a friend&#39;s birthday (happy birthday Ericka A!), and I had a great time.  Although Abashiri isn&#39;t responsible for whether or not you enjoy read more &#34; your company, my point is that doing AYCE is even better with a larger group of people.  Since they charge you extra if you do not finish what you order, it&#39;s totally safe to order something just to try it.  

My favorite rolls were the Paradise and Godzilla.  We also had the Mango &amp; Tuna, Crunchy Rainbow (even better than a regular rainbow!), Mexican (a little too spicy), Tiger, Lion King, Double Salmon, and I&#39;m certain I&#39;ve forgotten a lot more.  There were 7 of us, which means lots of rolls, and there was only ONE I didn&#39;t care for, it was baked and burnt the roof of my mouth.

The menu is HUGE.  AYCE includes miso soup, green tea, and a menu of 40 rolls to choose from!  Abashiri definitely has the biggest and best variety of rolls, and there&#39;s no way you will get through them in one visit!

The only reason I&#39;m giving Abashiri four stars and not five is because the service is so damn slow.  Initially, our rolls came out like 3 at a time, but then they came out in intervals of one roll.  In a big group, one roll doesn&#39;t last long!  I almost started to wonder if it&#39;s some kind of strategy - if they bring out the food slowly, we won&#39;t feel like sitting around any longer, and we won&#39;t keep ordering, right?  Of course, if we had ordered more, we might have faced the dreaded doom of paying extra for uneaten pieces.  You really just can&#39;t win.

The bottom line is that it&#39;s the best AYCE sushi in the suburbs.  Move over, Sakura!"

Put it in my mouth. I said my muthaf*ckin mouth...

Yep. That happened. &#39;Cause I&#39;m eatin&#39; all-you-can-eat sushi like all.damn.day... okay, maybe not all damn day, but defo for a few hours and defo enough sushi that a regular person probably could have spaced the quantity out to last the whole day. So there&#39;s that. 

Miso soup, green tea, sushi rolls like whoa and these little shrimp + raw quail egg boats that aren&#39;t part of the AYCE special, but are pretty much life changing and something you should for sure plan on getting on top of the AYCE menu.  

And while the sushi rolls weren&#39;t the freshest, nor the greatest, the $24.95 AYCE price and the variety of specialty rolls is outta control. I don&#39;t why you&#39;d do anything but that... and those shrimp+quail egg boats. 

I was glad I went with a decent sized group so we could all pig the f out and try a little bit of what felt like almost everything. I&#39;d get into specifics but honestly, I ate so much that it all kind of became a blur. In fact, at one point I actually inhaled the seaweed part of a roll that had come undone and partially lodged in my windpipe. I tried to dislodge it with my tongue and then by deep-throating my chopsticks to try and grab it, but then it became apparent that if I didn&#39;t get up and try to purge this piece in the bathroom, that I was probably going to involuntarily puke at the table with my group, or die choking on a friggin&#39; sushi roll at an AYCE sushi restaurant like some modern-day Mama Cass. 

Anyway, I *somehow* summoned all my strength and was able to clear a tiny part of my wind-pipe to silently excuse myself from the table and take care of business in the bathroom. I *think* I was discreet enough that no one noticed at the time, but figured it best that I come clean now so as to squash any suspicion of an eating disorder. No habitual or voluntary purging here, just a shoveler by nature and sometimes I pay the price. 

Anyway, check out the pics and see for yourself. I didn&#39;t take pictures of everything because we got sooo much stuff and I didn&#39;t want to be that super annoying and make everyone wait to eat before I can figure out how to work my flash."

This night began at a sports bar next door where I was watching some football &amp; my friend came up with the idea to get some sushi.  I not only had not eaten here before but I didn&#39;t know of any sushi restaurants in Bloomingdale, let alone an all you can eat sushi restaurant.  

When you find an all you can eat sushi place it is a good thing but when you find an all you can eat sushi restaurant with AYCE sushi it is a really good thing, except for your pants that might feel tighter from eating so much food.  

The staff here was very nice &amp; the sushi all seemed very fresh.  The rolls here were prepared differently than some other places which is a good thing.  It is always nice to try different styles.  

I enjoyed my experience here.  The only things that I can mention that weren&#39;t the best is that the rolls were a little bit smaller than some other places.  The price was also $25 for all you can eat while other popular all you can eat sushi restaurants offer $15.99 for lunch &amp; $18.99 for dinner.  Other than that it was an enjoyable experience.  I would eat here again if I was in the area."

We were so excited to take on the &#34;all-you-can-eat sushi&#34; deal. 

The restaurant was smaller than I expected, but very quaint. We arrived a little before prime lunch time, and seated ourselves at the table close to the sushi bar, but far enough to not be judged by the vast quantities of sushi we would be eating. The deal is that you can order as many sushi rolls, and maki rolls as you want, and as many times as you want, but you will have to finish all of what you order or else they will charge you extra on top of the $25/person pricing. I think $25/person is very reasonable pricing for how their &#34;all-you-can-eat&#34; sushi is set up. They give you the standard white sushi sheet that you can mark which rolls you want after conversing with your dining mates.

After we arrived to a consensus on which rolls we wanted, we decided on a meager number of 11 rolls to start our sushi binge. The rolls were made fresh right in front of our eyes and this made us very giddy and hungrier. The lunch rush started to trickle in and we knew that we would be there for a while since there was only one sushi chef behind the bar. This was okay with us because we were on vacation and had some time to kill. The wait for the sushi was not too bad. We got our first 4 rolls in about 15 minutes, and then the remaining rolls staggered in 5 minute intervals. The next round we opted for 8 rolls. Every roll was great except the seared tuna roll which had an off-putting smoky taste and gasoline smell. All together we had 19 rolls. The last two rolls were not pictured since we were more focused on finishing the food than documenting the last two rolls that we could have done without. Oh the consequences of gluttony. 

We were a bit slow getting out of our chairs, but we were very sushi happy!"

Remember that episode of the Simpsons where Homer goes to The Frying Dutchman&#39;s all-you-can-eat? That was me at Abashiri, except they didn&#39;t give us the stink eye or kick us out. They just kept serving sushi with a smile.

Sushi might easily be one of my favorite styles of food, but I&#39;ve found that you either pay an arm and a leg for quality or you end up having mediocre sushi that&#39;s still more expensive than most meals. However, I&#39;ve discovered that you can have your rolls and eat them too to the tune of $24.95 per person Monday-Thursday at Abashiri. It&#39;s easily the most affordable and most delicious sushi option in the suburbs if not the entire Chicagoland area. Yea, I said it!

We were greeted in Japanese by a petite woman who was also our waitress. She was the only person working there, except for the chef, and there was only one other table when we arrived. It stayed relatively calm the entire night and only two more tables were taken by 7:30pm. It meant that we basically had the waitress to ourselves and the rolls came out at lightning fast speed. I especially liked that when we ordered 6 rolls to begin with that they brought them out to us in groups of 3s so we could begin eating instead of having to wait for all 6 to be completed.

Between the two of us we split a Red Dragon, Godzilla, Lion King, Double Salmon, Salmon Bomb, NY Steak, Super Philadelphia, Paradise, Mexican and another that isn&#39;t coming to mind. Some were better than others, but all of them were good. I especially loved the Godzilla and Mexican, but I might recommend saving the Mexican for last as it is quite spicy (by my standards) and might make it hard to fully appreciate the flavors in the other rolls. We ordered 10 rolls total and barely put a dent in the AYCE sushi list. You could easily come here at least 5 times before you have tried everything they offer.

They also have a small cocktail and alcohol menu that features sake, plum wine and mixed drinks. I almost felt as if we were robbing them with how much sushi we ate for such a small fee, so I tried to throw a few more bucks their way by ordering a Mai Tai. I believe it was just a little over $6. The only complaint I have is that it didn&#39;t have curacao and didn&#39;t have the signature taste, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a real Mai Tai. But it is really alcoholic, so I can&#39;t hate too much. Even after 10 rolls it practically knocked me on my ass."

Shortly after out came the Bento Box it was a generous helping of rice (probably 1 to 1.5 cups worth), decent amount of sesame chicken in a thicker teriyaki sauce (probably 4 ounces of chicken), small yet tasteful salad with the vinaigrette dressing not being overly bitter or sweet, and the tuna crunch rolls.

Super Philadelphia - 3.75 stars. Salmon melted in my mouth. The rice wasn&#39;t as great as it could be.

Godzilla - 3 stars. Shrimp tempura inside with panko crust on top. A bit boring. With a name like that, I expected more.

This is rolls-only sushi buffet which is a first for me and I was a little nervous about having a lack of options.  I do love eating nigiri, tempura,etc which the buffet option didn&#39;t offer  but abashiri&#39;s extensive and unique rolls made up for that.

There are SO many different types of rolls that it was impossible to try single out one roll that made my night but my favorites were definitely the baked scallop and baked lobster rolls.  I would suggest going with a bigger party so that you can share the rolls.

Like every other sushi I&#39;ve been to you should finish the rolls that are ordered or be prepared to pay for the leftovers. SHouldn&#39;t really be a problem though..these yummy rolls will all be in your belly by the end of the experience..no matter how full you are."

I have noticed that their &#34;larger&#34; speciality rolls are stuffed with rice, minimal fish. Everything kind of tastes the same. We got four rolls Godzilla, tiger, louchie #1, and shrimp tempura cream cheese something. All needed some more flavor. The service was very good and they have an all you can eat sushi roll special for $24.95 but you are charged if you do not finish a roll. We got 4 rolls and the bill was $50 without the special and we did not finish the to rolls. Overall it was just ok."

Nigiri was good but the tamago was too firm/old. The rolls were very small and the fish very paper thin cut.  Crab stick inside was old,  dry,  and falling apart.  If it weren&#39;t for the premium price I&#39;d give another star."

Check out some of the specialty maki rolls at Abashiri! Sparks of yum were definitely flying as a group of 7 got together for Abashiri&#39;s AYCE sushi.  

Their AYCE menu consists of only maki and special maki rolls.  Abashiri is definitely for the folks that love creative maki and cooked maki rolls. My personal sushi taste runs along the traditional (nigiri!), but I found their maki very flavorful.  The flavors weren&#39;t just a mush of all kinds of ingredients, but seemed very well thought out and every ingredient complimented each other. 

Service was wonderful. The place is on the smaller side but even though we had a big group, service didn&#39;t suffer a bit.   My tip is that if you want AYCE, get your whole group to order AYCE.  Each of you should order 2 rolls and share away.  Still not full?  Order more rolls!  Tea and miso soup is included in the very reasonable price  ($25 bux).  I didn&#39;t know a few people in the group very well, but after some communal platters of sushi, we were all like a big sushi-loving family."

I&#39;ve never had spicy tuna that was sweet, to the point where I cannot taste the fish flavor. That was a major disappointment to me, as spicy tuna is a staple of the majority of the sushi rolls that they offer in their AYCE menu. Their yellowtail is good and I do not have a problem with their other fish. They don&#39;t use too much rice on their rolls and there is a huge variety; however, with the AYCE option, you are limited to only rolls, not nigiri. And the rice has fallen apart as soon as I picked it up with my chopsticks, the rolls need to be constructed better structurally. Their handrolls were ok; again, we revisit the spicy tuna issue of it being sweet on top of sushi rice making it extra sweet. I would come to this place if I was trying to save some bucks for sushi, just because it&#39;s close to my house. Otherwise, I would have other options available that I would drive to further away."

From what I can gather, the best way to do Abashiri is the way we did it: With a group of 5 or 6 people, on a weeknight, everyone doing the All You Can Eat and sharing lots of rolls.

AYCE includes miso (great for a cold rainy night) and green tea (good but there were no sugar packets on the table ... so I just drank it as-is) and lots of rolls. I&#39;m having trouble remembering everything we ordered but I know it included:
Ninja Roll (at least 3 of these)
Hawaiian Roll
Fire Roll
Godzilla Roll
Mexican Roll
Lady Roll
Mango &amp; Tuna
Lobster Roll

... and more, I think we ordered at least 15 or 16 rolls for 5 people. It got a little crazy.

I will say that I was a bigger fan of the fresh rolls than the cooked ones -- the one deep-fried one seemed pretty odd to me -- and overall the ingredients seemed fresh and tasty and pretty well composed. We also were treated by our sashimi-eating cohort to some sake and some kind of shrimp-fish egg-quail egg bite that was surprisingly sweet and rich. 

The waitress was attentive and kept the food and tea coming, and offered advice on NOT ordering rice, because that would just fill us up and we wouldn&#39;t have room for more rolls. She did fail to ask one of the sushi-eating crew if she wanted change, but it was easily fixed.

So: come here on a quiet weeknight with several friends who want to stuff themselves silly with sushi. The end. (Thanks also to OC Candice G who organized our unofficial outing!)"

I&#39;ve been to their restaurants more than dozens of times over the last few years and they never disappoint.   I&#39;ve become kind of a semi-regular and one of the servers (I forget her name) is always excited when she sees me coming through the door.   

I can&#39;t say enough good things about the place.   I love especially their spider rolls."

I&#39;m always greeted by the nice waitress here and I usually am able to sit wherever I want given the restaurant isn&#39;t crowded. The lighting is perfect and gives it a nice dinner feel. It&#39;s not extremely fancy, but definitely has your typical dinner restaurant feel to it.  On the walls are the pictures of many people who, I assume, are people who go there a lot, almost like a wall of fame. A few pictures of some famous golfers, who&#39;ve been to the restaurant have been there, are up there as well.

The all you can eat is spectacular. It&#39;s only $25 and you can get almost any kind of sushi you want! The nigiri (fish on top of rice sushi) is off limits, but who cares? FREE FOR ALL ON THE ROLLS, I TELL YOU! Miso soup also comes with the meal, but the waitress had told me only if you request it.  My friends and I go to this place very frequently, so the waitress knows us now. The waitress tends to poke fun at me and it makes me laugh every time. &#34;You better finish that, or you&#39;ll have to pay for it&#34; she&#39;ll say, every time I have only one roll left to go! 

When we&#39;re done eating, the bill is delivered immediately after we&#39;re all finished and it takes no time at all for her to run the payments. She always gives us a nice &#34;Thank you&#34; and bids us farewell until next time.

HIGHLY recommend stopping by this place."

Also, the cute little hostess/owner, Sumi, just added a 3 roll deal for carry out orders!

My wife and I regularly get 6 rolls for less than $50 including tax. Ridiculous for the quality and quantity of deliciousness that is Abishiri.

First, the hours listed on Yelp are inaccurate. We arrived at quarter to ten, thinking that they closed at eleven. A few minutes after sitting down, they were flipping the sign in the window - it turns out that they in fact close at 10.

Second, upon walking in, we were immediately slammed in the face with the unmistakable smell of bad fish. Not a good first impression for a sushi restaurant.

My third point might be politically incorrect, but I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s a legitimate means of judging a sushi restaurant...

Every single person in the restaurant (not many) - and every single person on the customer wall of fame - was white.

Since leaving Las Vegas, we&#39;ve been reminded how spoiled we were there in terms of Asian cuisine. Returning to suburbia is challenging in a lot of ways. Eating well is among the hardest."

The rolls are creative and the quality is ok.  There are sometimes..  odd things that are left out.  For example I ordered their shrimp boats and they just left out the fish roe.  Woops?  There was another roll I ordered that they managed to just leave out one of the ingredients.  Other than that the fish is fresh, the price is good.

Edit:  I am going to up this to 4 stars.  The service last night was very good and the lady who served us really worked hard to make our evening fun."

The tiger roll was awesome, the shrimp in it was deeeelish!! It was a good chunk of shrimp inside the roll. The all you can eat menu here included a very large selection of rolls which was cool, and you could get soup or salad too. The waitress was extremely friendly and even the owner (manager?) brought some of the food out to the table.

I still haven&#39;t tried their nigiri yet, but their abundance of interesting rolls keeps me interested and wanting to come back when I get the chance.  

For $25, it&#39;s an all you can order for rolls and hand rolls.  While there&#39;s no nigiri, the rolls are made well, plated fairly nicely, and aren&#39;t over packed with rice by any means.  They&#39;re generous with their portions and the customer service is typically spot on.

Why only three stars with such a good review?  We had REALLY slow service... we came in about 8:00, ordered up our rolls, and didn&#39;t get our first roll until 8:35 PM.  After that, it was about another 10 minutes before another two rolls, and then finally our last two rolls made an appearance after.  We quickly ordered up another set of handrolls and rolls, to ensure that the food kept coming so that we wouldn&#39;t be dragging this out until 10:00 PM.

I was curious what happened, so I inquired with the waitress why the service was so slow?  She explained that the restaurant got packed, and then a few large &#34;to go&#34; orders were made so they were busy prepping the those orders.  

My interpretation is basically that since they had a captive audience (folks who are here for all you can order rolls), they prioritized the to go orders first and then had us wait.

After all that&#39;s said and done, we didn&#39;t receive any discount or comped dessert or appetizers... while the waitress was very apologetic, I was disappointed that another gesture wasn&#39;t made (ice cream?  something?)  We had come to Abashiri hoping that we would be in and out within an hour, and instead if took almost two hours and the rest of our night was shot...

Verdict:  Listen, the food is good.  It really is.  The customer service is great, friendly waitresses who are wonderful.  If the owners are reading this, my suggestion is that in the future, if you have a table that&#39;s been waiting for a long time for their order, bring out something to tide them over... edamame, or perhaps even have the chefs prep up one-two of their rolls to bring out and explain the situation with an apology.  Feeling like our order didn&#39;t matter compare to the &#34;to go&#34; orders leaves me feeling like the red-headed step child that the family doesn&#39;t love, and ends up souring the mood of the evening.  Will I be back?  Ultimately, yes, because the rolls are pretty tasty and the variety is huge.  I&#39;ll just hope that this is a rare experience and hope that the owners learn to adapt to pleasing the customers instead of being flustered and avoid our table knowing that we&#39;ve got long wait ahead of us."

No lies, no lies, no lies as Drake would say. Honestly I don&#39;t know how else to describe the sushi here except for it being BOMB as hell. It just has so much flavor. This is the only place that knows how to make spicy tuna rolls how I like it. I feel super full and healthy everytime I leave this place. I always always order alaskan and spicy tuna roll within the bento box. It&#39;s just the best combo ever. I&#39;ll order this for lunch and or dinner. For lunch it&#39;s under 10$ and for dinner it&#39;s around $14. I love that you can substitute some stuff if you don&#39;t like it. Also they have a great $24.95 all you can eat buffet for sushi.

Atmosphere:
Small sushi place with lots of the feels! As soon as you walk in, you can see the walls filled with the photos of happy customers. The decor has a lot of traditional Japanese items, and it has a real home feel. It looks a lot better inside than the plain and rather dull exterior lol. Can&#39;t judge a book by it&#39;s cover indeed! I hope to be on the wall with my friends someday...

Food:
All You Can Eat, All Day and Everyday! Sushi is of surprisingly good quality and plenty of variety! You are bound to find a roll you enjoy. I love most of their Avocado rolls! They aren&#39;t skimpy with avocado either! However the only thing that dampens the experience for me is the use of Cucumbers on a lot of their rolls. I hate cucumbers, and the particular cucumbers they use has a taste you can&#39;t ignore. Other than that, I love the food at this place! Baked Spicy Salmon and the Super Philly roll are some of my favorites. Which I love and makes it a distinct place for me! This place has a knack for making their rolls nice and creamy. I would also definitely try their Baked Rolls for a new experience. Hot sushi never tasted so damn good! There is always a different taste on the menu to try. Don&#39;t forget to ask for the complimentary Miso Soup and tea!

Service:
We had this wonderful waitress that was very attentive and friendly. She greeted us at the door and took care of us the whole way through. She even made us smile and cracked a couple jokes too! My 6 six person group was well taken care of considering we ordered well over 200 pieces! All You Can Eat to the MAX!

I had a wonderful experience with friends here, and I would recommend it if your girl was in the mood for sushi! They really seem to treat their regulars well, and I hope to be on their wall of pictures one day. The $24.95 price for all you can eat quality sushi is hard to beat! The service and atmosphere are a very welcome addition!"

We also had never been there, so wanted to know which sushi was all you can eat, but it took a while for the waitress to come over to us, even though there weren&#39;t too many people.
The reason I gave this place 4 stars was because when the food arrived, it was great! I can&#39;t even decide which roll I liked the most, they were all good!

only issue i had was the service. it was unbelievably bad. we sat there for TWO hours  and only one roll came out at a time. we wanted to have a quick sushi dinner and continue our night but we sat there for two hours waiting to get all of our sushi. the waiters were not attentive to us at all, we waited nearly an hour for our first roll.

I especially enjoyed the many &#34;combos&#34; they have to offer, affordable with a bit of variety.  I tried the 290 combo (most of the combos are named after the area so you have the local names, roads, etc.).  The combos come with 3 small fried dumplings (very yummy), a small house salad (loved the house dressing...I think it was Ginger/Orange?), and 2 different kinds of sushi/rolls - mine had the Philladelphia roll and the Spicy Tuna roll.  Delish!

My coworkers have tried many things here and said they haven&#39;t had anything that they didn&#39;t like yet.  AND they don&#39;t mind giving you seperate checks :-)

It&#39;s in a little spot in a strip mall, easy to overlook.  The big sign just says &#34;SUSHI&#34;.  The staff is very friendly and when they greet you hello or say goodbye it sounds a little like they are yelling at you in another language but it&#39;s fun."

We got there at 730 and did not receive or first roll till 9:30... keep in mind, they close at 10. This have us no time to order more when we had paid for ayce sushi.

The AYCE was not tested, as that kind of thing leads to obesity. My dinnner compadre and I have sampled sushi from north to south and this place rates... OK. Not fantastic, not great, just OK.

I would give it higher marks except for the service. Yes, I read the reviews that said the service was substandard, yet I was not prepared for getting our meal served piecemeal over 25 minutes, like separate courses. What did we order you ask. Spicy Dragon and Crunchy Rainbow rolls, and 6 pieces of nigeri sushi. What?!? And it took a half hour for everything to hit the table? Yep.

So even if the sushi was excellent they lose a star for the service. And it wasn&#39;t. It was... OK.

The bill came to $35.50. Not my kind of dining experience. We will not be returning, not when we could just as easily gone to Sushi Mono in Wheaton."

The waiter was attentive and friendly. They have an interesting ordering system - they give you the menu and a small ordering sheet. Once you&#39;ve made your decision, you put the quantity you want against whichever menu item you want on the ordering sheet. This actually seems quite brilliant, as there is no room for misunderstood words (and with my Australian accent, I have found this to be a problem sometimes!), and it probably makes it easier for the waiters and chefs. 

We ordered two rolls (total of 11 slices) and one serve of nigiri (total of 2 pieces). Our rolls were: one tempura salmon and some vegetables on the inside (can&#39;t recall which), and fresh salmon on the outside; one California roll. Nigiri was the salmon nigiri. That was enough to fill us up! All items were delicious and seemed freshly prepared. There were only four other tables/9 other people in the restaurant, so it wasn&#39;t very noisy or busy; just a nice, relaxing, quick, nutritious and delicious meal. 

It cost us $24 (before tip) for two rolls and two pieces of nigiri.

We will definitely be back!"

Seriously, though - Next time I might have to walk here...all you can eat!

And I did.

I ordered a few things based on awesome name alone - Godzilla Roll, Lion King Roll...and I LOVED them. This is the third sushi place I&#39;ve been, and it ties for the #1 spot. $25 for the AYCE, and I was more than filled. Almost everything was fantastic with the sole exception of the NY Steak Roll...which I tried for the novelty of having steak in a roll, and it was ... well, steak in a roll. Nothing terribly great about that one, but everything else, from the Double Salmon Roll, to the Paradise Roll (sweet goodness that was great), was fantastic.

Going back asap, no questions about it. And it&#39;s right down the street...I can call it &#34;exercise&#34; by walking there!

Great service and great food. I can&#39;t recommend this place enough.

Go.

Eat.

This time my girlfriend and my brother joined me for a weekday all you can eat food coma inducing night of sushi. I am usually weary of the all you can eat tag put on sushi for many different reasons but this was just about as good as it gets.

The waitress was very friendly and we received a complimentary bowl of miso soup which is usually the deal and it was good. Then came the rolls. I like to start out with some of the raw ones and move onto the tempura and more spicy rolls later as to not mask some of the delicate flavors in the beginning of the meal. The usual fare of spicy tuna and Philadelphia were very good and not fishy at all. We then moved onto some more interesting ones like the crazy roll and the fire roll. Both were very good with the crazy roll being a definite order. After that the more notable rolls were the rock and roll and the tiger roll - both very good with the rock and roll being a nice light take on a regular roll.

By far the most surprising roll was the K.G. roll. At first glance it seemed a bit odd with the tomatoes and a spicy tuna roll. My girlfriend ordered it and it was the shocker of the meal. A perfect balance between very spicy tuna with fresh tomatoes and cooling avocado. The best part of it was the fact that the garnish covered up the rolls completely. It was essentially a small feast in just one roll.

A great place to go and try all you can eat sushi with a group of friends. A huge menu so there is no shortage of items for picky eaters. Take my word for it go and check this place out and order the K.G. roll - im not sure what it stands for and I don&#39;t care its just that good."

The service has been great when we have visited and we&#39;ve never had to wait long for a table.  It is a bit loud inside, but if it&#39;s a nice day, it&#39;s great to sit outside.  
We really like the chefs board, the meat and cheese is delicious.  We&#39;ve also enjoyed the Tuscan shrimp and the meatballs.  The charred cauliflower has great flavor to it, with the pine nut crumbs.  The small plates are a pretty good portion, I think we have ordered 2 or 3 and been full.

We have a seriously love affairs with brick oven wood-fired pizza! Especially if it&#39;s done right! I just happened upon this place while doing a Yelp search and seeing their rating and the comments, I knew we had to check them out!

Mozzarella Flight which is Fior di latte with evoo &amp; sea salt, mozzarella di bufala with pesto, and burrata with asiago lavoush. I never thought a flight of cheese could be so amazing! We tried not to devour this plate too fast! Oh cheese! We are the cheesiest! 

I ordered the Bacon Clam with roasted garlic béchamel, mozzarella, fontina, clams, bacon, thyme, &amp; evoo. The bacon mentioned on our pizzas is actually prociutto and its saltiness with the clams and cheese makes this pie so goooood! Now, the dough... Oh, man! This is on the top of my list! It was chewy and crispy! And best of all... I took it home, put it in my toaster oven, and it was JUST AS GOOD as it was the first time!! I am not kidding you! I have never had a good leftover pizza! Don&#39;t lie and tell me you have microwaved anything and it was just as good the second and third time around! This one was!!!

The boy ordered the BBQ Pie with sweet bbq sauce, roasted chicken thigh, onion, bacon, provolone, mozzarella, &amp; cilantro. He loved this pie as much as I loved mine! We seriously can&#39;t wait to go back and try some other pies here!

I think this may be our new pizza stop! The prices are a little high, but they&#39;re using quality ingredients and you can&#39;t beat that! I highly recommend checking this place out and soon!"

The menu is fresh and exciting with twists in every dish. Pizza with pear and caramelized onion kicked up with Gorgonzola, shrimp pasta with pistachio pesto, beet farro salad, whipped burrata with sea salt and honeycomb. These are just a few neat offerings on the mostly small plate menu. It is cheese, pizza, and pasta heavy (as any decent southern Italian restaurant should be) so beware if you have food allergies. The menu states they have GF options. They have a full bar and pretty extensive wine list.

Our first visit was less than stellar service wise. They were busy and our server seemed to be having a problem with handling all her tables. I shrugged it off (and the long wait for our meal that resulted) and enjoyed the food. Our second visit was completely on point. Service, drinks, food were outstanding. Kudos to Lauren!

Favorites here are the Chef&#39;s Board with melt in your mouth San Danielle prosciutto, spicy soppressata, rosemary and fennel marinated olives, and fresh mozzarella; Sausage Fennel pizza with pistachios, and Bucatini Garlic Cream with big chunks of smoky bacon and tender morsels of chicken thigh. Try a sorbetto for a dessert.

If I would make one suggestion it would be to knock down the a/c just a bit. The blast of cold air hits the tables and my food gets cold less than 5 minutes after being served. I can always throw on a sweater if I&#39;m cold but that excellent food needs to be eaten hot."

If so then come to Gia Mia! The pizza here is as fresh as you can get. The ingredient taste like they are freshly plucked from the garden or the butcher shop. The pizzas are assembled and cooked in their custom oven at 1000 degrees. If you are expecting a Chicago style deep dish pizza or something overly greasy then this isn&#39;t the place you want. If you want something that tastes real and not just preservatives then come here.

Everything I said also applies to their other items. Yes, they have other freshly prepared dishes such as salads, pasta and fish. The salad I tried was amazing. For an appetizer I had the smashed potatoes. I couldn&#39;t get enough of it. 

Be sure to also try the root beer! 

The staff was also very friendly. I recommend you show up early or call ahead for reservations on the weekend. They get pretty busy.

We got the pear caramelized onion pizza which is a good combination of sweet and savory together and we also got the Bucatini garlic cream pasta which was a very rich combination of flavors in the pasta. Lately, for desert we got the Panna cotta + blueberry sorbetto, which was my first time trying Panna cotta and it won&#39;t be my last.

We ordered a few apps and shared a pizza. We got the zucchini , cauliflower and potato appetizers. (See posted pics) The potato was my favorite but they were all delicious and I was fond of the presentation (prior to us devouring half of it as shown in pics.) How is it that food always tastes better when it looks good? We split a Margarita pizza with meatballs and some whipped ricotta. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the cheese and I found the pizza lacked flavor.

Here&#39;s the summary: Pizza, awesome, everything else, meh.

The service was reallllllly unfortunate. Total missed opportunity. The waitress was neither friendly nor welcoming, and even when we ASKED for a recommendation, she did not provide one. It was our first time at the restaurant and we weren&#39;t provided any bit of info on the menu or the restaurant in general. When it came to picking a pizza, we asked the waitress for a suggestion and she said something to the extent of &#34;it&#39;s all about the dough and how it&#39;s cooked, so just pick any pizza with toppings you like and you&#39;ll like it.&#34; Is it that hard to just suggest one? She also checked on us so frequently it was obvious she wanted to hurry us out the door, even though there wasn&#39;t a line of people waiting. Clearly, this mostly killed the whole experience.

Food:
The burrata pizza - SO GOOD. Get it.
Some pesto cavatappi pasta, veal meatballs, and the pea small plate were all fine at best. 

Also, the food comes out REALLLLLLLY FAST, which while that normally is good, it made us want to order slower so we actually had time to enjoy the food and enjoy each other&#39;s company...and the waitress just wasn&#39;t having it.

Also, the dessert menu was a total let down. 4/7 items were some combination of sorbet/gelato, and the others just weren&#39;t enticing enough, so we passed on that.

I will return, but I really hope to get a server that cares and makes the experience much better! I also will probably only order pizza."

I wanted to go out for &#39;date night&#39; and I remember getting a menu from Gia Mia at the Wheaton Wine fest. What sold me is that they have far more options than just pizza. They also have &#34;Italian tapas&#34; so we decided to give it a try. 

-Cauliflower-- I&#39;ve actually always hated cauliflower, but my favorite menu item at Girl and the Goat is the cauliflower. I wanted to try it here also because it had toasted pine nuts and breadcrumbs. It&#39;s so delicious. I could have ordered another one just so I didn&#39;t have to share.
-Butternut squash tortellini--this was stuffed with gorgonzola, which we didn&#39;t notice on the menu. I despise the taste of gorgonzola so I only had a few bites of it. My husband who does like gorgonzola loved these.
-Veal meatballs with polenta--my favorite thing we tried. Their homemade sauce is so chunky and delicious. They also offer a veal meatball pizza, which we considered ordering because we loved this so much, but we ran out of stomach room
-Shrimp on toast--the sauce was delicious on this. I think I ended up eating most of it

Gia Mia also offers Happy Hour during the week where you can buy one pizza and get another at 1/2 price. I didn&#39;t get a chance to sample the pizza, but I think it&#39;d be a great idea to stop by for HH with some friends.

After looking through the wine list we asked our waitress, Lauren if she had Red Wine suggestions?  We let her know we dine frequently at &#34;Fire + Wine&#34; and that we always go with a bottle of &#34;If You See Kay&#34;  She told us she would ask their &#34;Sommelier&#34; or wine steward.  We both thought that was really nice of Gia Mia to have.  It just adds a robust level of attention to their wine list.  We ordered a glass of Mastroberadino &#34;Mastro&#34; Aglianico and a glass of Angels &amp; Cowboys.  The first was very smooth and the 2nd was more of a Red Zinfandel strength.

To eat we shared the small plate on special &#34;Crispy Eggplant&#34; with pasta and tomato sauce.  Very impressed with how amazing this tasted.  After that we had the &#34;Hammaker&#39;s Pie&#34; pizza and we especially liked how crispy the pepperoni was and how delicious the mushrooms were.  The brick oven has a temperature between 800 -1000 degrees F.  

We skipped dessert for next time and looking forward to when Lauren, the owner, and the team at Gia Mia serve us again.  They all did a great job helping us feel comfortable during our stay...asking us how our meal and stay were going.  We wish them great success in downtown Wheaton.

Gia Mia is a &#34;creative and eclectic&#34; place where a couple can enjoy some good food and wine, but also a kid-friendly, family-friendly environment."

Speaking of the setting, it&#39;s really loud in the front of the house. The back had fewer tables and was a little quieter, but otherwise you can forget about holding a conversation if you&#39;re coming here with a group.

We started things off with roasted cauliflower, which was covered in olive oil, sprinkled with pine nuts and came with very fresh green and kalamata olives. The ingredients were very fresh, and the flavor combination was quite good.

Our pizza bread came at the same time. This is their pizza crust adorned with only three additional ingredients; sprigs of rosemary, sea salt, and olive oil. I thought this was a bit too salty, but I definitely also thought that the quality of the dough meant good things were coming up.

Our pizzas came next. I had a bite of my wife&#39;s quatro formaggio, and again wondered at how top quality pizza places can somehow make a tomato jelly for their pizzas that tastes amazing. The mozzarella was excellent as well.

I have a standing rule to order seafood at new restaurants, which meant I ordered the bacon and clam pizza. Bit of a stretch, sure, but this adventure had its rewards: the clams tasted fresh, the pizza tasted fantastic, the saltiness of the bacon combined differently from the saltiness of the clams, and I really liked the garlic sauce that was laid out with the thyme in the pizza in lieu of tomato sauce/jelly. I would absolutely get this pizza again.

Fire and Wine is usually packed to the brim on any given night, and I expect Gia Mia to be the same way (it was already a 30 minute wait for a Saturday lunch, which was impressive.) If they decide to put up some fabric on the walls or rugs on the floors, maybe we&#39;ll all be able to talk about how food the good is while we&#39;re there, too."

I had just finished a 5K the night I stopped in with my friend for dinner, I had also worked out earlier that day and I just wanted to dive into my &#34;cheat&#34; meal for the week and not stop to capture the moment! :)

We came in around 8ish on a Saturday night, this also was a night of the Cubs Playoff game so they weren&#39;t packed to capacity which was nice... it&#39;s sometimes hard to find a spot to enjoy dinner when you don&#39;t care to watch the game.  We were seated immediately.

My friend and I shared the mozzarella flight - which was pretty awesome, and this cheese lover was ALL OVER that!!! We decided to share two pizzas which we were told took 3 minutes to cook.  We decided for a white kind of pizza that had artichoke on it, and one red...I think we just got the margarita pizza, but both were REALLY good!  My friend ordered a beer, and I got their seasonal apple cinnamon sangria...also very good &amp; tasty!!!

Our server was wonderful...I was very satisfied with my first visit here.  I will absolutely be back again one day to try another pizza, or maybe a pasta dish."

It&#39;s fairly new to the Wheaton restaurant strip, but has been a great Italian addition! I would recommend trying the ricotta honeycomb as an appetizer! When they say honeycomb, they are not exaggerating, it is a literal honeycomb, prepare for sticky fingers! As an entree, I went with a pasta dish, Pacherri Vodka, giant noodles, flavorful sausage in a vodka sauce. If you find yourself if the town of churches, make a pit stop for a glass of red and some great Italian dishes!"

It&#39;s easier to avoid the crowds and crazy service.  We called ahead and found out they don&#39;t do reservations but they do something else, which is call ahead seating.  It prioritizes you over walkins but you still have to wait.  It&#39;s basically the same thing as a reservation because I&#39;ve been to plenty of restaurants where I had a reservation and still had to wait 45 minutes.  This way they are more up front about it, and once you check in, you can leave your number and they will call you.  So you can take a stroll around downtown Wheaton while you wait.  Also, if they call you and your party is not there, they won&#39;t seat you.  This worked out for us because the group ahead of us wasn&#39;t all there, so we only had about a 10 minute wait.  Score!
The atmosphere is pretty loud and casual, yet exudes a bit of a fine dining appeal.  But overall it&#39;s a nice spot to get some good food.  Kids are welcome, but the aisles between tables are tight.  I was backed right into the hostess stand but they graciously moved anytime I needed to get up.
I believe they call themselves farm to fork, and the food tasted great.  We had a few tapas to start off.  The potatoes were excellent, and so were the cauliflower.  We also had fried zucchini which was alright... I probably wouldn&#39;t order them again, cause they aren&#39;t that special.  We had the pomodoro pizza.  It was ok.  It was lacking some flavor.  I think we&#39;ll try a different pizza next time.
Overall the servers and staff were attentive.  Would definitely check this place out again."

But, after looking at the menu, I figured I&#39;d give this tapas place a try, with some of my pals.  Good call, because the food was excellent.  Everything was expertly prepared, using fresh ingredients.  The service was really good, too, with plenty of attention paid to little details.  Gia Mia southern-Italian style pizza alone is enough to keep me coming back, but the full package is definitely worthy of 5 stars."

I just don&#39;t like the food that much. (Full Disclosure- I don&#39;t love Sicilian style pizza, which is most of their menu.) 

They have gluten free pasta and pizza crust which taste really close to its gluten counterpart. My husband is not gluten free and enjoyed the pizza we ordered.

We called ahead to get a seat and got there at 5:30 on a Friday.  It was already starting to get quite packed.  The vibe was very energetic with good loud music playing.  It felt like a date night! ....ok, except we had 2 toddlers in tow. Wah woh.

We ended up ordering some adult beverages from a great wine and beer list!  We got pesto pasta and mac and cheese for the kids (So good, my husband said that he could eat it up all for himself!).  For us, we ordered a bunch of small plates--  Oysters with pork belly, English Peas on toast with burrata and pesto,  and beet salad with goat cheese and pistacios.  Ooh, can&#39;t forget the fried zucchini fritters which the kids also devoured!

Very trendy inside with the menu consisting of Italian food scaled down to small plates in tapas style.  Great idea to get a bunch of different flavors in one meal.

Service was excellent and knowledgeable about the menu. Originally we went in to have a tradition meal of two plates but started ordering off the small plates section and was hooked.  There is also a large selection of adult beverages as well as mixed drinks.

Started with broiled oysters and bacon...three oysters. To an order so keep in mind that these are tapas style plates.  They were delicious but the bacon was the main flavor in this plate.  Smashed potatoes are a garlicky hit with a little hot pepper heat and a sauce you can eat by the spoonful.  Get the potatoes.   Next plate was peas on toast...sounds odd but I found this bright green dish surprisingly good.  Fresh peas smashed up with EVOO and spread on baguette style slices of bread topped with pea shoots.  Don&#39;t be scared, it&#39;s a fresh new favorite flavor.  The meatball plate of also a great and didn&#39;t disappoint.  Last plate was zucchini fritters.  Yummy plate as well."

Gourmet pizzas and some pasta dishes are on the menu and looked very creative.  Definitely will have to try them.  My wife and I enjoy the small plate approach ... Fill up the table with a variety of things to share.  That is what we did on our visit to Gia Mia.

It was hard to pick a favorite, so I won&#39;t ;).  Each dish shows creativity in taste and texture combination...chef shows imagination and nails it.  I could eat their quinoa every day.  The roasted cauliflower dish was unique and executed perfectly (loved the black olives in there!).  Veal meatballs were tender and the sauce was very good. I loved the dates in the kale salad...and I&#39;m not a date guy.  Overall I really enjoyed the mix of flavors with every dish.  Quite unique...definitely for Wheaton.

So...atmosphere.  Definitely seemed to try for a urban feel with some minimal modern influence, but didn&#39;t quite hit it (not to say some tweaking wouldn&#39;t take them there).  Front area almost had a Chipotle feel (to me).  I would consider a different color paint, turn down the lights a touch, 2 or 3 less tables.  Back area is better though.  It is really loud in the whole place when it&#39;s a full house. Very difficult to carry a conversation.  It is kid friendly, and it shows.  Wanting something a little more intimate or adult, dine later and request back seating.

Service was really good.  Fun servers who really seem to love their job there and the table staff are really on top of their game.  

Definitely want to go back and try more.  Very solid start Gia Mia!!!"

We were then presented with a bill from another table.  We informed the the server of the error and requested our bill.  We were assured that the incorrect billing would be refunded to my card.  That did not happen. 6 Days later I checked my bank account and had never been refunded the erroneous billing.  I had to call and talk to a manager.  I gave him all the info and he said he would credit my card.  This did not happen either. 5 days later I  had to call again to request my card be credited.  Tomorrow I will be visiting to ensure that my card be credited and to let them know my displeasure of the my visit in person.  Do yourself a favor and visit the Geneva location.  I have to give it two stars because the food is good.  It&#39;s too bad the service and general attitude of the management at the Wheaton location ruins the experience as a whole."

Wheaton was sorely lacking a real Italian restaurant with quality ingredients and preparation, and so far, they&#39;ve delivered. 

I noticed some of the management and staff worked/work at La Sorella Di Francesca for a long time which is a fantastic sign that this place is going to be the real thing."

First the good news:  Gia Mia is open for lunch Thurs-Sat, YEAH!  Same great menu as dinner. Also the bussing issues have been resolved.

I have to revise my rating of the tagletilli and sausage dish.  I said it was very good.  I would like to change that to Excellent.  We also had the linguini and shrimp dish today.  That was also Excellent.  Included in the dish were crimini and oyster mushrooms.  Both expensive ingredients.  No canned button mushrooms here.  We also tried the Chef&#39;s board today.  That was also in the very good to excellent category.

To those who say Gia Mia is expensive, I would say if you want the freshest and best of ingredients, prepared to order, you might have to spend a dollar or two more."

The kale salad was the best I&#39;ve ever eaten. Perfectly dressed. Delicious. All of their grilled pizzas are amazing. Light and airy crust with the finest and freshest ingredients. The shrimp small plate was fantastic. Cheese platter with dried fruits was perfect to start. I&#39;ve gone here for both a girls night and with my husband and my two young children.  Even with my kids the staff was so kind and patient.  They have a nice little menu for the kids as well. The wine list has a little something for all tastes.  I will be back as often as I can!

We then waited for longer than anyone else and they tried to seat us at a table that wouldn&#39;t have fit 5 comfortably with no room for the food plates. We then waited another 20 minutes and were the last waiting. Lots of apologies, but I would have rather had an honest appraisal of the difficulties in seating large parties and come here at another time.

I can&#39;t rate the food because I left before I was seated. We called ahead to be put on the call-ahead list.  When we arrived we checked in and the hostess told us we would be seated &#34;shortly&#34;. After waiting 30 minutes, I asked how much longer and was told that it shouldn&#39;t be much longer. 

When couples (like us) came in to inquire about wait times, they were told 30-45 minutes. They were also offered the opportunity to sit at the counter. We were not.  Interestingly, some groups they seated as soon as they arrived.

I&#39;m not sure the benefit of the call-ahead list. I also think it is poor form to tell someone they would be seated shortly when the actual wait was in excess of 30 minutes. When I told them we were leaving they didn&#39;t seem to care. While I realize that they had more customers than they could clearly handle tonight, it&#39;s never good to treat a potential customer the way we were treated tonight. 

Hope they work out their front house issues.  I&#39;d like to try the food."

The staff went out of their way to not only call us several times to apologize, but they delivered the food, flowers for my wife, and gave our family a free dinner for the mishap. Pasta is amazing, the meat balls best I&#39;ve ever had. Rest assured that we will be a long time customer not because the food is great but because these folks get customer service."

I called ahead and the hostess indicated it was a 20 to 40 minute wait. I asked if they had a call-ahead list. She said, yes and asked when we thought we would arrive. I gave her a time of about 40 minutes later. Upon arrival, we were told it would be an additional 20 to 40 minute wait. I asked why there would be an equitable wait, of which I thought we had already fulfilled by being on the call-ahead list. She said &#34;that just gets you to the top of the list. there&#39;s still a wait of 20 to 40 minutes.&#34; 

I understand you&#39;re busy, which is wonderful for Wheaton, but please reconsider your seating process for the sake of your patrons: either start taking reservations, or don&#39;t have a call-ahead list, or make it very clear what the purpose of the call-ahead list is, because to us it seemed like there was no point to having one.

The pizza is to die for, and the atmosphere is just the right combo of fun and cool without being pretentious. We are from the Northeast, and this is the closest thing we have seen here to &#34;New Haven-style&#34; pizza. The ricotta and honey comb is one of the most delicious things I have put in my mouth-after the first time, we now get it every time. And if you are feeling super-luxurious, try the Nutella pizza. Also, the seasonal mule drink is great every time, you can basically just get whatever the mule is when you&#39;re there, and it&#39;ll be great!"

It should be noted that it is pretty darn expensive. However, that&#39;s to be expected when you&#39;re getting quality ingredients and handmade food. In particular, the Ricotta/Honey &#34;small plate&#34; was amazing but it was $8 for 4 small pieces of bread...

My biggest complaint is their nicely stocked full bar yet complete lack of good cocktails on the menu - they only have two, and neither are good.

Portions are a bit bigger than you might expect, so don&#39;t order too many &#34;small&#34; dishes.  The style of the food, the decor of the interior is quintessential Italian.  The food is tasty, mostly low fat, and healthy.  TO THE OWNERS:  I would suggest you consider changing the name a bit, like to Gia Mia Tapas bar.  The &#34;pizza&#34; in your name conjurs a completely different idea...the idea of just one more of the too numerous pizza places all over Chicagoland.  Your name denotes a sense of &#34;me too&#34;...I think you would get a more accurate message out if you replace &#34;pizza&#34; with &#34;tapas&#34;.  Keep the menu the same, just change the name.  Tapas conjurs a more healthy, up-scale, more authentic (to Mediterranean countries) idea that I believe will pull in more customers, and not turn off the anti-pizza weight-wacthing clientele."

We arrived at Gia Mia at 4:30 on Valentine&#39;s Day-party of 12-no reservation. We understood it could be a stretch to accommodate us-but if it&#39;s too much, say something. Don&#39;t make us stand in the entryway-waiting for 15 minutes-while there were only 5 other tables occupied in the entire restaurant. After being seated and we order drinks the waitress asks us if we were aware that since it was Valentine&#39;s Day-there was a 1.5 hour limit to the table. No- we were NOT aware and had that been mentioned we definitely would have taken our business elsewhere. The waitress said since we were not informed of the time limit we &#34;should&#34; be ok to stay. After we hit the two hour mark the waitress asked if there would be anything else- we asked if we needed to give up the table or were we fine to stay. She said she would ASK if it was ok for us to stay. I&#39;m sorry, but when you have a large party spending well over $400.00 on small plates-I would think you would let us be. Mind you...the restaurant was NOT full and no one was waiting to be seated. 
I completely understand that our request to accommodate a party of 12 without a reservation was asking a lot. However- I would have preferred Gia Mia to just tell us that they couldn&#39;t accommodate us instead of making us feel like they were doing us a favor-at our expense."

We were glad we went. The focus here is pizza with some small plates, pasta and veggie dishes. Beer and cocktail is very limited but they had choices we were happy with this time. A lot of wine choices.
We ordered the Tuscan bean dip and charred cauliflower as starters. OMG! They were both utterly amazing! Bean dip came in a little jar with plain pizza crust t spread it on. The crust was thin, crispy,chewy and great with the dip. The charred cauliflower was heaven in veggie form. There was some grilled radicchio and pine nuts and some honey that made it all taste amazing. It was our fave item that night.we ordered three pizzas, the veal meatball,burrata and arugula ,and wild mushroom.  They were all really good. My only quibble would be that the burrata needed more burrata on it. There wasn&#39;t much so you really didn&#39;t get a good taste of this wonderful cheese. I definitely will be back."

Came here for a quick dinner a few evenings ago. I got the spicy pork teriyaki. It had a nice little kick to it but not overwhelming. It had a good flavor to it and they had a nice portion size. I had enough for leftovers the next day.

My wife got the pineapple chicken teriyaki which was also tasty. Good flavors, nice portion size. They also have a free complementary salad with our dinners. This place is well enough to warrant a return."

We decided I try this new place and they were well known for their chicken teriyaki. I usually don&#39;t like teriyaki because the sauce an be overly salty. I went for it anyways because when in Rome, do as the Romans. The chicken came out on a giant plate. There were rice, the chicken and a side of salad. It was delicious and big.

The food here is fantastic!!! I used to always get the beef teriyaki or the chicken teriyaki and my husband would try different things everytime we&#39;d go and he was always a happy camper. I lived close by so I used to go here a lot. Their portions are HUGE and their prices are reasonable. My husband and I would sometimes share one plate of beef teriyaki and both be stuffed by the end of the meal. The meal comes with rice, salad and extra teriyaki sauce in a cup and comes up to about $9. 

They make your food pretty fast. They have an eat-in area but it isn&#39;t very big.

Me and the baby split a standard chicken teriyaki, as well as a pineapple chicken teriyaki plate. The pineapple chicken teriyaki wasn&#39;t bad, although next time I would stick with the standard teriyaki plate--teriyaki sauce + sweet and sour sauce doesn&#39;t taste quite right. 

Happily, the teriyaki sauce they do have is quite good. Nice and simple, not too mirin-y, not too sweet.  The chicken was cooked nice and tender, and just the right bite size for everyone at the table.

I don&#39;t know the difference between great teriyaki and bad teriyaki. All I know is that its suppose to be like a sweet soy sauce. 

Located next to an Aldi and a Chinese Buffet, this place is a small little eatery in a strip mall. 

Their claim to fame is their teriyaki sauce which I found to be tasty. I got the:

Chicken Teriyaki: (8.99) Chicken was juicy, it comes with salad and rice. It was sweet and salty and tangy. The salad had some sort of sweet creamy dressing which I like and the rice was a shorter grain than most Asian take out places which was a nice touch. 

What really stands out about this place is the HUGE portion. (See Picture), I got like half a chicken&#39;s worth of meat and a pound of rice. It all comes on a gigantic plate.

They also have extra teriyaki sauce bottles everywhere just in case you wanted more.  

Overall I would say if you&#39;re a teriyaki lover, this is the spot for you. I&#39;m pretty indifferent about it but I do recognize good quality and clean service which this place certainly does have. 

Keep in mind the food takes some time to come out because its cooked to order. 

Will definitely return."

The spicy pork was more sweet than spicy, and I liked the portions to this because I was full after half. There was a slight smokiness to it too, which I enjoyed, but it was too weak for me in spiciness. However, my tolerance for spicy foods is higher than average so.. haha.

Fast, efficient service. I had called in my order 30 minutes ahead. Google&#39;s navi directed me over to this pizza place on the other side of the street (-.-); thankfully a yelper posted tips on how to get there correctly hehe.

I&#39;ve had better spicy pork so I don&#39;t think I would order it again, but I enjoyed it nonetheless so taking into account the price, portions, and no-frills service, it would be a solid 4 from me."

I&#39;ve visited other businesses in this strip mall. But until yesterday, I never stopped here. 

I had a pounding hunger headache and I needed to hit the auto parts stores over in this area to look for some parts. Yelp reviews told me about how this place had fantastic homemade teriyaki sauce. As a longtime Japanese food fan, I&#39;m usually not the biggest fan of teriyaki -- mainly because a lot of people get lazy with it and just use store-bought sauce. If you&#39;re going to do it in a restaurant, make it your own. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too much to ask. 

This place does. Also, as soon as you walk in, you see that they have two things on every table: a bottle of their homemade teriyaki sauce (so you don&#39;t have to ask for extra if you eat in), and a bottle of Sriracha. (Proper Sriracha -- no Lee Kum Kee bootleg cocksauce here!) 

Lunch special is great. You get a little salad with a nice homemade creamy dressing, fluffy rice (white rice is included, but you can substitute fried for an additional charge), and your meat of choice. I had chicken. I&#39;ll upload photos in a moment. 

Drinks selection is your typical fountain stuff augmented by a cooler full of iced tea/energy drinks/Vitamin Water/Sobe. I wish they offered hot tea, but that&#39;s a minor quibble. 

Their homemade teriyaki sauce is great. Add Sriracha to the fluffy white rice and contrast the layered spiciness with the sweet/salty teriyaki and have a very happy party. In your mouth. I heard what I said. 

They also offer free samples if you&#39;re not sure. Stop in and give it a try. I want to try the spicy pork next time. :9"

I&#39;ve driven by many times and noticed it out of the corner of my eye, however I&#39;ve never been motivated to stop in and try it until today. 

Having seen some raves reviews here on Yelp and some good buzz around my office from co-workers I decided to try a few things on the menu. I ordered a spicy chicken teriyaki meal, an order of fried rice and a five piece side order of gyoza.

First off let&#39;s touch on the chicken teriyaki. The foam container had the chicken and some sauce in two pockets and a main pocket of white rice. The chicken itself was well grilled while still retaining a tender texture and the sauce was a very nice compliment. The overall taste was excellent and the portion size was very reasonable for the money. The white rice included was just regular white rice so there&#39;s not much to note there. 

The gyoza&#39;s included were pretty good as well but a little on the small side. For those unfamiliar with gyoza, it&#39;s a variation on the pot sticker. These seemed to include a seasoned white meat of some type (possibly pork). These were nice as an appetizer but I&#39;ve had better.

Finally to comment on the fried rice. The fried rice I had was pretty good there were chopped up vegatables and a lot of egg mixed in. I liked the overall taste though I would probably not order it as a standalone side again, but would instead upgrade the white rice bundled with the entree to the fried rice if possible. 

Overall I liked my food and will definitely be coming again. I&#39;ll give this place five stars for being great food at a great value."

The chicken teriyaki plate was good, and he enjoyed the chicken katsu plate.  The salad came out from the kitchen with a delicious dressing on it.  We decided to try the variety of sauces they had bottled near the kitchen.  We identified one of the bottled sauces as the salad dressing and I added some more to my salad.  WHOA, bad idea!  It&#39;s apparently a dairy-based sauce and is NOT good after it&#39;s been sitting out and fermenting.  Gross.  Please, PLEASE Joy Teriyaki - refrigerate your dairy-based sauces so they don&#39;t sit out and get rank.  That&#39;s a tummy issue waiting to happen!  I ended up having some tummy gurgles afterward. :( 

Aside from the foul-taste of the Sitting Out Sauce, the rest of the dining experience was good.  Joy Teriyaki was a no-frills place with fair-priced lunch specials.  I&#39;ll be back, but if I want any more salad dressing, it won&#39;t be from the bottle sitting out on the counter!"

Food - Wonderful.  The best teriyaki place I&#39;ve ever eaten.  Their spicy chicken teriyaki makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside its so good.  The perfect blend of sweet and spice.

Service - Sub par.  The latest complaint comes from my experience at lunch this afternoon.  I called an order in as I typically do at noon.  The woman on the phone struggled to comprehend what I was telling her and didn&#39;t understand my name even after providing it to her a 3rd time.  Once the order was placed I was told 15-20 mins for pickup, which pleased me since I work 15 mins away from their location.  Upon arrival at 12:15-12:20 the food was not ready so a coworker and myself paid at the register and found a seat to wait for our order.  12:30 rolls around and still nothing.  12:40, still waiting.... 12:55 was the final straw.  I went back up to the counter and kindly asked what was the reason for the delay.  You could tell by the shocked look in her eye that our order had either been given to someone else or forgotten, keep in mind several other people that came in after us who had not called in orders had already gotten their food and almost finished.  1:00 and our food was finally up!  Thinking they might offer us a discount or a credit on our next meal I was immediately overwhelmed with disappointment when she placed an order of egg rolls in front of us as compensation for the inconvenience.  Some of you are saying to yourself, &#34;I don&#39;t know, that seems fair.&#34;  If you have ever had the egg rolls from Joy Teriyaki you would have been just as disappointed as we were, especially after this last price increase cost us 15.00 an order for a plate of fried rice, chicken, salad, and a fountain drink.  I am not one to complain but I have had this happen to me several times in the past and nothing seems to change except for the price, which is now higher than ever.

To sum all of this up.  Joy Teriyaki has always been a favorite but I will no longer continue to give them my business given the current prices.  There is a great chinese restaurant in Glendale Hts off of North Ave called China Chef where the food quality is just as good if not better and the portions are larger for half the price, its not the same food but similar cuisine.  If you have had a similar story or are just fed up with prices like myself please join me in boycotting this establishment."

I love the hole-in-the-wall feel of the place.

Their teriyaki is very good, I love that there&#39;s a bottle at every table and also several other bottles of various sauces available for your dish. 

I&#39;m glad they don&#39;t have too many choices, because I would never be able to make up my mind. But one day, I decided on the simple chicken teriyaki and I was very surprised at the portion I got...HUGE! When I was paying, I was thinking it was a little pricey but I then saw the amount of food I payed for and it made it that much better. 

All of the chicken in my dish tasted fresh and not very fatty, which is what I like.

I had the 7.99 teriyaki chicken lunch special. Came with a big portion of chicken, white rice and a side salad with what i want to call a sesame, rice vinegar dressing. Not a fan of vinagrette dressings but this one was really good. The chicken was tender but had a nice carmelized char from the sauce, the sauce itself was amazing. Each table had a bottle of teriyaki sauce and a bottle of sriracha, two very essential things to me when i eat teriyaki, so you have controll over the heat or sweetness. 

The portion size is pretty big for the price..i ended up boxing up almost half of it because i got full. One negative thing is they take a bit of time to get your order out, my lunch break is an hour long, it took me 15 minutes to get there around 15 minutes for my food to come out, 15 minutes to eat and 15 to get back. This being my first time it really isnt a big deal, next time ill call ahead, as i suggest anyone on a time frame to do so. Other than that, it was a great meal, the only thing id add is some sliced avocado, i dont know if thats just a california thing, but it makes a huge difference, also lookong forward to trying the teriyaki beef and spicy pork.

&#34; yup, call in a spicy for me &#34; 
It&#39;s about the best lunch around and since I&#39;ve been there often, I can say it&#39;s consistently good. 
The &#34;call in&#34; part is key, as it appears all orders are made on the spot and not just scooped out of some vat in back . At lunch time, the wait can burn up a lot of your git ta&#39; et&#39;n time, also the place fills up quick. I&#39;m unfortunately creature of habit, so the chicken Teriyaki lunch deal is my thing- but I have dabbled in the spicy. And it&#39;s spicy spicy. Not OMG spicy, but just enough heat to remind you what you got with every bite. 
If you are dining in, lunch is served on a china plate, or a foam box if you get it to go. Bottles of teriyaki and Sriracha  are on the tables and real silverware is available. Unless you are one of those fancy know it all metro scooter riding types, then chopsticks are available to fumble with before grabbing a damn fork and eating like the rest of us. 
Not that I&#39;ve ever done that. 
Ok it was me. 
Tips: they like cash, and reward cash payments with a punch card, although I&#39;m not in the club so I&#39;m not sure what it gets ya.

This place should be called Happy Happy Joy Joy Teriyaki.  Located in the weirdly unholy Bermuda Triangle of good Asian food near Army Trail and Bloomingdale Road which has Pho Ha, Hong Ning and Joy Teriyaki within a 1 mile radius of each other,  this place managed to break a couple of my resolutions, nay three of them, thus keeping with the tri-themed review. 

First of all, as with 80% of the country, I resolved to eat healthier in 2013.  Less red meat, namely pork, which is the best meat in the galaxy.  I also resolved to exercise more in what free time I have, and to eat less, as in, eat until satiated.  Not, &#34;Eat until food bypasses digestion phase and escapes oral-gastric tract by means of nostrils.&#34;  Yes, eating until food comes out the nose is NOT the plan.   
So how did I come to squash these resolutions?  A fateful Friday where I dropped the wife off to visit a friend, and I was to kill a couple of hours in whatever way I imagined.  Go to the gym?  I could have, but I didn&#39;t bring my bag.  I suppose that couldn&#39;t stop me from finding a trail, or even a sidewalk to just walk off a few calories.  But no. I contemplated going to the Avalanche to have a drink and catch the Bulls game, but I thought I might get thrashed if I walked in there with tall Hunters on my feet.  SO, I went to Half Price, picked up a stack of 50 cent Cook&#39;s Illustrated issues and read some in the car while waiting for the call to pick up the wife.  When the approximate time came, and the call didn&#39;t come through, the hunger buzzer in my belly alarmed.  

Deciding on Joy Teriyaki out of the three restaurants named above, I opted for the Spicy Pork and Chicken Breast Plate.  It took about 15 minutes for the food to be ready, but good things come to those who wait. Time food was ready - 08:11pm.  Time wife called for car service - 08:13pm.  Went to retrieve her and ended up going to Target before heading home.  Ate salad portion of meal while walking around Target.  Home at 10:20pm.  Watched Netflix while eating my delicious Spicy Pork and Chicken.  From what I remembered, the pork was tender, with minimal fat.  And it was my favorite cut of pork - SHOULDER.  The Crash Test Dummies comes to mind.  Mmm mmm mmm mmm.   Wasn&#39;t too spicy, but it tasted great and the chicken was also very clean tasting.  The rice, I could have used more of it, but it was cooked well.  The best part of it all?  The teriyaki.  Holy shabazz.  Talk about unctuous in a good way, this stuff had mouth-feel galore.  I mixed a little sriracha into mine and fell asleep while eating.  Kind of sad, no?  I woke up rip-roaring full, and sad, because I had to admit defeat and put it away in the fridge until the next morning.  

2 days later, I&#39;m still saving it in order to prolong the joy."

From the outside you would think that it was like some low quality restaurant since the sign is so plain and the parking lot in front of it it getting pretty poor. But yeah, not too shabby.

I thought at first the prices were a little high, but then after getting the food I was just like, WHOA! I ordered the beef and they seriously give you about two handfuls of beef. It wasn&#39;t like amazingly  tasting beef teriyaki but it wasn&#39;t horrible either. 

Went here once and it was packed but I guess it all depends on the time of day because this last time I went, it was afternoon and it was like dead. Guy at the register was literally staring at the window. Good place to go if you want quick Asian style food with rice that&#39;s not americanized yet."

Its was excellent.  I went for the fried rice instead of the white rice this time as well.  All around good food.  The eating area does need work though as the walls in some places look like they might have small holes in them.  Kind of gives the saying &#34;hole in the wall&#34; a whole new meaning LOL.  It&#39;s really not bad and the place is pretty clean.  Other then the simple seating area, the place has good food.  You can see the kitchen area and it looks clean and organized which is the most important. They make their own teriyaki sauce and its very good.  I did see an small sign that said they were going to raise the prices on the menu in January 2013, I was bummed but if its only a buck or two, its still a great deal.  Overall good food! Thanks yelpers for helping me give this place a try!  Good food good price!"

After eating at Joy Teriyaki you will feel fat and you will feel full. 

You definitely get what you pay for here...in food and in flavor, especially for a &#34;fast food&#34; type of joint. I always go for their specialty, the chicken teriyaki. The chicken is always tender and you probably get about 10 ounces worth. I opt to either split the dish with someone, or else I find myself with lunch for the next day.

Yays: 
- Massive portions. When I say massive, 2 people could easily share a dish.
- Killer teriyaki sauce. And bottle of it at each table.
- Love the fried rice &amp; veggie egg rolls. And the gyoza.
- Spicy pork. It has just the right kick. 
- Salad comes with every plate. I suppose that&#39;s their effort to make you feel like you&#39;re eating somewhat healthy.

Nays:
- Service blows. It&#39;s not fast, and it&#39;s not friendly.
- I question where the chicken comes from. It tastes good, and it&#39;s tender. However,  I often wonder how much of  &#34;real chicken&#34; it is. ((I think I&#39;m jaded after watching &#34;Food Inc.&#34;))
- Kinda grimy inside.
- Gets very busy during peak hours. Expect a 15 minute wait for &#34;fast&#34; food. 

Overall, Joy Teriyaki isn&#39;t bad. It&#39;s not the best I&#39;ve eaten, but for a quick bite, it definitely does the job!"

So I&#39;ve told you how good their teriyaki sauce is- but let me tell you- their fried rice is AMAZING. It is quite different than your typical asian fried rice.

Food:

Portions were very generous and MSG FREE! I was very full and probably should have taken leftovers home, but it was too good to refrigerate. They literally give you a gigantic plate for dine in lol. It was my first visit and I had a mixed combo of Chicken Breast and Chicken Teriyaki. The dish came with Fried Rice and Salad. The chicken was hot, fresh, and so god damn TENDER.... It was complemented perfectly by their homemade Teriyaki sauce. The sauce wasn&#39;t too sweet either which is a problem most Teriyaki dishes have. Not too strong either... Just right and they hand you a whole bottle for dine in! The Fried Rice and White Rice deserve a special mention as well. They don&#39;t use the typical bulk cheap rice. They use legit Japanese rice that is more pricey and has that hearty texture. You can taste the freshness of the steamed vegetables in the Fried Rice. The Rice and Teriyaki go so well hand in hand! The Salad is okay. It&#39;s just there. It&#39;s not bad. I am definitely coming back for the food!

Service:

Nice Counter lady. Food came out under 7 minutes when I came in while it had a decent amount of people in which was nice. Can&#39;t really say much else, it&#39;s a Walk in food place. The lady gave me good directions to find the place as well. 

Atmosphere:

Hole in the wall place. Not going to lie, the place is kind of depressing. It looks like it hasn&#39;t been renovated since the 80&#39;s. The walls literally have 80&#39;s convenience store wallpaper that is peeling off. You get used to it fast, but I would not take any girls on dates here. Good for groups of hungry college students for sure lol. It&#39;s also kind of hard to spot. It&#39;s located in the Walter E. Smite parking lot area and right next to Subway.

Overall, I will go here for the epic food! I was really satisfied on my first visit, I hope to update my review when I try out the other menu items."

I had the chicken and beef teriyaki combo ($10.50) and everything was excellent! I will say that I&#39;m not comfortable spending $8+ on work lunch usually so I probably won&#39;t make it habit, but I&#39;d spend $20 on this at a restaurant dinner and leave with a smile on my face.

Surprise, it&#39;s actually the crack-like teriyaki sauce at Joy Teriyaki that defines modern addiction. (full disclosure: i do not know what crack is like).

I really wish I were kidding about this, but I&#39;ve been to this restaurant nearly three times weekly for the last six months. It is a running standard for my office, friends from the city, nearly anyone if they are hungry and within twenty miles of this location. The service is pleasant, the menu diverse (even though I always order the same damn thing), and they don&#39;t mind if you use an entire bottle of sauce, which my boss and I are prone to doing.

The food... After comparing it to drugs and addiction earlier in the review, it&#39;s hard to go up from there, but put simply, it&#39;s massive, massive portions, cooked perfectly, with a boatload of sauces and seasonings to tickle any palette. The store is not really all that much to look at, but if you&#39;re looking at anything other than the food, something is horribly wrong with your brain and it needs a checkup.

If you&#39;re remotely close to Glendale Heights, for any reason, this should be a top priority to visit. Drugs are bad. Joy Teriyaki is good.

PRO TIPZ:
* Call ahead. The wait isn&#39;t bad, but since they make everything fresh, if you let them know when you&#39;ll arrive for dine-in it can shrink the delay between you and your saucedrugs.
* The salad is fine, but I recommend opting for extra rice instead.
* If there&#39;s a big group, the quality does start to suffer as their small kitchen fights to keep ahead of the orders.
* There&#39;s nothing wrong with the standard Chicken Teriyaki, but I prefer the Chicken Breast, which is cents more and all white meat.
* Seriously, about the whole addiction thing. I&#39;ve had people tell me, after one visit, that they&#39;ve been craving Joy months after the fact. There is something really really unusually amazingly addictive about this place."

A bottle of the teriyaki sauce is on every table so you can drench the dish and rice (and I recommend you do).

The only downsides are that it can get quite crowded at lunch time and during the winter it stays pretty chilly with the door always opening and closing."

My dad recommended this to me and my family, so we went together for dinner.  I have to rave about that salad dressing like everyone else.  What is it that makes it taste sooo good????  I could eat salad all day with that dressing!  We usually bring some home with us.  My kids (1 and 3) love it too and I&#39;m thrilled that it helps me get them to eat veggies.

You get a generous portion whatever delicious meat you choose, and a generous amount of rice with a nice fresh cool salad (dunno what that dressing is but it is delicious).  

I normally get the spicy pork!  Wow it has a smoky flavor to it, tender and stir-fried in a spicy sauce.  I love it!  The chicken is good as well, very tender and grilled.  The teriyaki sauce is sweet but not too sweet and flavorful.  The beef is bulgogi and was good as well but not as great as I thought.  Stick with the chicken or spicy pork.

Also their gyozas are amazing.  Its fried and crispy with nice flavorful pork and veggies inside.  I love those as well.

My first impression was that it was very clean!  The cashier greeted me warmly and the menu was very straightforward.   They had chicken teriyaki on special, like $5 or so.  We had our 2-year-old son, so I was relieved to see that they had high chairs.  The Beatles were playing non-stop, and it was a happy little detail for me.  Our food arrived on big white platters, arranged beautifully in ample portions.  From first bite to last, the food was amazing.  The rice was cooked perfectly, the teriyaki was just right.

My friend took me here one time and now after more than 2 years later, I still come here regularly with my husband. We are devoted customers - we have brought friends to this place. We even ordered their catering plates when we had a gathering once. The husband always get the spicy pork, I sometimes switch around between chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu. DELICIOUS. Salad is fresh, the dressing makes it super yummy. We always try to grab the salad dressing and sweet &amp; sour sauce bottles from the counter but sometimes, no luck. If you do have those, mix these sauces together with the teriyaki sauce and sriracha (they are at every table), and you are set. Great price too! I always have some leftovers to take home.

Then the taxi service that you reserved to get to your friend&#39;s place fell through, so you bribe the hotel to have their shuttle service to take you just a couple miles outside their 5 mile radius.  You have to listen to the guy complain the entire way, but you finally arrive to your smiling friends to ring in the New Year!  

At 4 AM your taxi service fails again!  Luckily, you have fantabulous friends who are sober and drop you at your hotel on their way home!  You have a late check out of 2PM... You make it out of there by 1:30 and you&#39;re exhausted!  There is nothing open on New Years Day except fast food places, but you don&#39;t pass any on your way!  Then you randomly see this diner!  It&#39;s 15 minutes until they close at 2PM and they&#39;re totally fine with you coming in and messing up their totally clean floors and grill for breakfast to feed your New Year&#39;s empty belly!  Yea, that was how we met Bella!

Needless to say, we were already happy to get in outta the snow!  Our server was so sweet and she sang as she worked!  We were the only ones in the place, so we were in and out in about 30 minutes!  Fine with us cuz we were starving!

The boy had the Hungry Man&#39;s (or some other similarly named meal).  He had a couple of eggs, bacon, hash browns, and toast.  He&#39;s a growing boy and there wasn&#39;t one thing on his plate that he didn&#39;t love!  I think his favorite was the hash browns!

I ordered the country fried steak special.  It came with a couple of eggs, hash browns, and biscuits.  What a special!  The breading on the steak was light and well seasoned.  It&#39;s not often you get that perfect steak with a good breading!  I loved it!  I would say it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve ever had!  And I judge places on their gravy... This gravy was tops! The hash browns were the perfect blend of some crispy and soft potatoes.  Everything was so good I wanted to devour it all!  Instead I took some home for another great meal!"

This place was delicious!  My boyfriend and I woke up and we were feeling lazy and decided to go to Bella&#39;s Short Stack for a late Sunday Breakfast (it was a lazy Sunday...we had to sleep in first!).  There was a bit of a wait when we arrived, but since it was just us two they were able to sneak us into seats that just opened at the bar (do you even call it that in a breakfast place?!).  It was a nice change of pace.

This place had super friendly and attentive service.  It was also super clean.  I loved the retro decor with the vintage toasters.

I ordered one of the daily specials... a bacon and avocado omelet... and here is the awesome part since it is Autumn you could get pumpkin pancakes instead of regular ones.  These was amazing.  I am salivating thinking about how delicious they were!  There was way too much food to eat, but I ate until my belly could not fit one more bite.

First, like others have said, it&#39;s much larger inside than it would appear from the street. I love the bar area that they have, and was impressed by the number of seats there.

I got the breakfast burrito, which was disappointingly bland. The hashbrowns were good, but my burrito didn&#39;t have a ton of flavor. I was hoping the home made salsa would help, but I found that kind of disappointing too. It wasn&#39;t really salsa as much as it was diced salsa ingredients without any moisture. And I didn&#39;t care for the salsa OR sour cream option, when the menu says &#34;and.&#34;

Definitely worth another visit, but probably to try something else on the menu. Judging by others&#39; reviews, I should have ordered a skillet. Next time..."

It&#39;s considerably larger in side than you would think and seating has never been an issue for us, even with our 1 year old son in tow.  Of course parking could be better but that&#39;s just part of being in downtown Algonquin.

The breakfast potatoes are awesome!  The fruit is also awesome! Everything actually tastes good and you get a lot of it.

We have regular breakfast dates and are always looking for something new/special.  We picked Bella&#39;s based off of reviews here on yelp and it truly lived up to the good reviews.

The restaurant is much roomier than it looks from outside, but still has a cozy, old-fashioned feel with diner-style counter seating as well as regular tables.

We had two of the day&#39;s specials - a meat lover&#39;s omelet and a Bacon PepperJack omelet.  Both meals came with the option of breakfast potatoes or fries AND toast or pancakes.  Wow.  We opted instead for a cup of fruit on the side.

The eggs were perfectly cooked and the sliced avocado on top of my omelet was the freshest and prettiest I&#39;ve ever seen!  Bacon was cooked perfectly and the fruit (melons, strawberries and pineapple) were fresh and sweet.

As someone else mentioned, the coffee is fantastic.  It was smooth, mellow and definitely didn&#39;t have those &#34;sitting in the pot for an hour&#34; overtones that you often get from other restaurants.

The waitress was friendly and efficient and the overall vibe of Bella&#39;s was clean, charming and inviting.  Definitely making this place a regular stop!"

I guess &#34;cozy&#34; would be a good word to describe the ambiance if you don&#39;t mind having to crab walk between all the tables to get to your seat. Upon being seated, I could almost hear myself decide on what to order but it was a struggle to do so over everyone else&#39;s conversations three feet away. Now, I get it. More tables mean more business, thus making more money, but when your staff constantly bumps into themselves (and my wife&#39;s elbow) it&#39;s time to reevaluate the feng shui. As for the food, it was almost decent enough to prevent me from writing this review...almost. The omelette wasn&#39;t bad. The pancakes were, well, pancakes and the small handful of hash browns they threw in rounded out the meal. If this place were a 24 hr diner, I wouldn&#39;t be the least bit surprised, but it&#39;s a breakfast/brunch restaurant that reminds me of the place Roseanne Barr worked at on her show in the early 90&#39;s. The price was the only thing that made me smile. Two meals and hot coffee flavored water for $20 ain&#39;t bad. I&#39;m sure the owners of this place are great people and I don&#39;t mean to bad mouth their establishment, but this place can improve and does actually have a lot of potential.

Minus1 star for blah food

All these reviews rave about this place so I was expecting great things. Especially with the waitress speaking only Spanish, which at times was confusing but I thought the food would be legit. Bland food. Really disappointed, won&#39;t be back.

You literally need the alcohol because there are children with families who seem to not care if their kids are running around screaming at the tops of their lungs.

Torta was excellent - did the milanesa torta and was not overloaded with sour cream or avocado - it had just the right amount of condiments to enjoy all the flavors in the sandwich.   

Tacos were ok.   The steak was a bit overdone.   The carnitas were deep fried and lacking flavor and the al pastor were the star of the show.

Horchata was great.   Staff very nice and helpful.    Space was super clean.

You are paying what? $2-$3 for this coffee and you still have to prepare it. No thanks!

Antonio Ristorante makes some great food. My family comes here quite often - and raves about it to me over the phone - so I made a point to do dinner here while I was in town.

We used to frequent this location years ago when it was still owned by Sergio, and whoever took it over is putting it to good use. The food was phenomenal from start to finish.

A basket of fresh bread plopped down shortly after us, and it had some nice Italian bread and delicious focaccia; that focaccia in olive oil -- YUM.

For drinks, we had a lemondrop martini, Chianti, and gin. Entrees were the Pizza Hawaii, Tilapia Ai Carciofi, and a special: Rolled Flank Steak. AWESOME food.

I feel confident leaving 5 stars knowing my family has dined here many times and never been disappointed, with the exception of one time (they were short-staffed and the meal took 3 hours end-to-end). To put it into perspective, that&#39;s roughly 1/30 visits. It would be bad if that was someone&#39;s first time there (because it would probably be their last), but it looks like it was just a fluke.

I would love to airlift Antonio&#39;s to my new home. I&#39;ll definitely be paying them a visit when I&#39;m back in town!"

It was a beautiful night to sit outside and Frank and Dave were setting up to play. That is when things started going downhill. The busboy brought us bread. Waited half hour to no avail, asked for a waiter, after about 40 minutes, a waiter took our order, brought our drinks out relatively quickly. Our appetizers took about 30 minutes which was then followed by about an hour wait for dinner. The food was subpar, fried calamari undercooked and a very small portion for $15. The Chicken Milanese was bland and served with romaine lettuce not arugula. When we ordered a second bottle of wine , they were out of the original brand so the waiter brought us a different pinio at the same price. Of course we were overcharged .
When I told the hostess about the discrepancy, she said &#34;what you want, free food ?&#34; No, just merely pointing out another mistake, one of many that happened throughout our evening, not enough silverware, wrong soup, check amount.....On and on. The tables around us were all complaining as well. Other then the ambiance and outdoor patio, thus 2 stars, I would never recommend this place.

The pizza was all right; nothing stood out or disappointed me as far as taste goes. The pasta, on the other hand, was interesting. I&#39;ve had black pasta before, but this was literally a TON of black squid ink dumped on linguine and its accompanying seafood. In fact, it was so astonishingly black, my first thought was, &#34;This is the most metal meal I have ever seen in my life,&#34; (then again, our waiter seemed pretty hardcore himself with his skull tie clip, but I digress). Anyway, the sauce was loaded with salt, which is a shame since the pasta was cooked well and the seafood was good.

Went here for my boyfriend&#39;s work holiday dinner. I would say this place is 2.5 stars. 
Service was ok, again i understand it being busy but when you come in with larger party that you booked in advance you&#39;d think they&#39;d make sure there was enough help. Meal started a bit annoyingly as I waited for my white wine quite awhile after everyone else at the table had the red wine that was on the table poured for them. Then I proceeded to wait while everyone else had their drinks brought to them. Even the pop &amp; iced tea. 

Appetizers were a burnt and too chewy octopus and oysters rockafellars which were pretty tasty but again nothing to write home about. Minestrone soup was your standard non-homemade (or at least tastes like it) variety. 
My entree sounded much yummier the way it was described on the specials menu. Peas were mentioned yet I didn&#39;t see them. All there was was a ribeye (over-cooked) and literally 4 thin potato wedges surrounding the steak on all 4 sides. Not very fulfilling as a protein. Wish that was better explained by the server or on the menu. Dessert was a sampler platter with pana cotta, tiramisu, teeny tiny cannoli and cheesecake.

Again nothing special.  Not sure there anything unique or wonderful enough to make me come back again."

My wife and I ordered pasta.  I ordered Penne Bolognese.  This is my typical &#34;acid test&#34; when trying an Italian restaurant for the first time.  The sauce was excellent with nice pieces of ground sirloin and a delicious savory and somewhat smokey flavor.  This is not a just thrown together sauce.  It&#39;s obvious that they simmer this sauce for hours.  If you are a fan of Bolognese you would do well to give this a try.

My wife ordered bowtie pasta with salmon in a vodka sauce.  She enjoyed this as well although I think I had the &#34;winner&#34; of the two dishes.  Portions are ample and we both had enough for small meals to take home.

They offer dozens of wines and an extensive selection of Italian wines which is nice to see for a change of pace.  They are reasonably priced at $6 to $10 a glass but you have many more options if you order by the bottle.

This could have been a 4-star review except for a  couple of items.  The only areas that were just adequate was the salad that only comes with their house oil &amp; vinegar dressing.  (If there were other options, our server didn&#39;t mention them.)  I found it just average.  Our young female server was pleasant but didn&#39;t tell us that there were was a soup option other then Minestrone (Scarole).  She didn&#39;t explain any of the specials either as the male server did to an adjacent table.  Not a big deal but the place only had 4 tables occupied and she could have spent a little more time explaining the dining options.  Again, not a big deal and it certainly won&#39;t prevent us from coming back. 

Finally, although both of our dishes were very good, prices for pasta dishes are just a bit on the high side.  There are 3 other Italian restaurants within a 15 minute drive that we frequent and Antonio&#39;s seems to be at the high end.

As I mentioned, this is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Very good pasta preparations and an interesting wine list are highlights.  I&#39;ll be back to try one of their wood-fired pizzas."

The wine list was pretty extensive but I would have appreciated more options by the glass. The wood fired pizza list was inviting and I will definitely need to check it out the next time we come.

While the food was great and the place was adorable, one weird thing happened that knocked my review down,
I ordered a pizza and after a while, they brought out a pizza. It looked like the pizza I ordered, so they gave it to us and left. I picked up a slice and cut off a piece for my coworker to try. At this point, the server reappeared and it turned out that that wasn&#39;t the pizza I had ordered, it was brought to the wrong table. That&#39;s fine, it happened. But he had my pizza with him, and when I asked to have the pizza I ordered rather than the one they brought us by mistake, seeing as I had ordered it the way I wanted it and all, they said no, because I had taken the first slice I had &#34;already started it&#34; and couldn&#39;t have the pizza I ordered instead. So customer service here is apparently &#34;If you trust us to get your order right, you don&#39;t get your food if we screw up.&#34; Now the pizza was still good, and it wasn&#39;t THAT different than what I had actually ordered, but that is still a really bad way to treat your customers, I think. We hadn&#39;t even taken a bit of the first piece, and I wasn&#39;t asking to keep BOTH, I just wanted the one I ordered. They apologized, which was nice, but that didn&#39;t change the fact that I still wasn&#39;t allowed to have what I ordered.

In the end, we&#39;ll probably go back, but it will not be soon, and I will definitely be double checking our orders before they&#39;re touched."

It makes me sad I will never come here again. Friday night I came here for dinner. When the bill came, I put my credit card down for the table. When the bill to sign came back, my credit card was gone. Not once did anyone apologize for the inconvenience. Offer a drink while they search. Offer to take my name and number while they searched.  Instead 3 people scrambled around and they were all bickering in front of us. I still haven&#39;t received a call to say whether it was found or not. I had to suggest I give them my number and name.

My cousin and I went last night. What a wonderful evening and delicious food! I had the balsamic salmon. It was beautifully plated with zucchini slices. A very generous portion. I had a Ceasar salad to start. Fresh and delish dressing. My cousin had a spicey-sauced pasta. So generous a portion that she had plenty to take home. The service was excellent.

Walking in i love the ambiance. It&#39;s warm and inviting. The lights were dim which i completely appreciate. I hate bright over head lighting or spot lights on your table that to many places have. Here, The warm glow is relaxing. Food was good. My hubby had the sea bass Mediterranean style. Lots of bones happening though so caution to those who aren&#39;t familiar with being served a full fish. Having The fish prepped in front of you is nice. I had the halibut with the veggies and pesto. Loooved it. Only 2 bones in mine. I&#39;d go back and reorder halibut with the minestrone soup though. It was delicious. Warmed me from my Chicago sub zero chill! I ate so much i didn&#39;t have room for dessert but next time for sure I&#39;ll be sampling it.
I think this would be a fun place to go as a group to. Birthday or just getting the family together for a nice dinner. 
Tried the pizza before from here too. It was really good. Even my kids and their friends loved it. Can&#39;t go wrong with it. Actually, I&#39;m so lazy i don&#39;t want to go to the grocery store today, i might just order pizza for pick up for dinner tonight haha ;)"

Simply put, Antonio&#39;s does almost everything right!  Warm greeting at the front door, service is super accomodating and very polite.  But let&#39;s talk about the food.  They are REALLY generous portions.  If you leave hungry, that&#39;s your own fault.  We were just there tonight and I had the Beef Carpaccio and it was delicious... but remember when I said they do almost everything right, my only complaint is that that dish in particular is a touch expensive, but hey, you pay for what you get and it&#39;s wonderful!  Nice wine selection, nothing that will blow you away, but it&#39;s all wine that is meant to drink with food.  We drive from Winfield to eat here and will continue to do so.  It&#39;s a wonderful alternative for people who want real, fresh Italian food!  Maggiano&#39;s is junk, Olive Garden is crap.  It&#39;s either here, Francesca&#39;s, the city on Taylor street, or Italy for authentic Italian food.  The restaurant is spotless as well!  Go and have a great time!  I&#39;m 34 and would bring a date there or go with family, as it&#39;s perfect for all occasions.  Hats off to you guys over there and thank you for having us as your guests!  So far we have been waited on by Blake (tonight), a younger looking bald guy (I&#39;m bald too, no disrespect) who has a very commanding presence in the dining room ...think Vin Diesel in a restaurant, and a younger woman.  They all do a great job!  See you again soon!"

She recommended the braciole and it was fork tender. And, I am fussy when it comes to soup.  It has to be steaming hot.  The minestrone was just that.  Pasta is al dente, so it&#39;s a bit &#34;firm&#34; rather than mushy.  My son&#39;s chicken dish was excellent.  So, all in all, a wonderful experience.

I&#39;ve been here a couple times now - both for work meetings - and have had great experiences! I had a sweet tooth the first time, so I ordered the apple bread french toast. This was delectably sweet! The perfect combo of diced apples, fresh baked apple bread, powdered sugar, a vanilla bean glaze, and pecans. Yummy!

On the savory side of things I&#39;ve had their steak skillet. Let me tell you, it doesn&#39;t get much hardier than that! This plate full of scrambled eggs, sliced tender steak, mushrooms, onions, and provolone cheese was ah-maze-ing. It also came with a side of toast. Needless to say, it looked like I barely ate anything when I was finished, but that&#39;s only because it&#39;s so filling! Made for great leftovers though.

I had a bit of a hard time deciding what to get because of the plentiful options. Everything sounded delicious! But I decided on the berry berry crepe and it was freakin yummy! The crepe was soft and pillowy and the cream inside tasted wonderful. It was a huge portion too. My fiance got the apple french toast which was also very delicious. 

Our server was pleasant, attentive, and prompt. And we were very impressed by how quickly we got our food!! Even with me taking time drinking my coffee, I think we were only there for like half an hour.

Decided to order stuffed waffles with a side of fries and signature french toast with sausages. The food was great and fruits were fresh. The service is what determined my rating of a 3/5. The waitress was nice, however forgot to ask if I was finished eating and proceeded to take my plate without my okay. I tend to be very protective of my food and did not take this lightly. Also, when my friend asked for a to-go box, the waitress placed to box right on the food instead of off to the side, which obviously dirtied the box. If the service had been significantly better, I would&#39;ve rated my experience a 4/5 however it wasn&#39;t.

They have a huge selection of things on their menus from pancakes to french toast to bennies to sandwiches and more! The more we looked at the menu, the more we kept changing our minds because everything sounded so good! 

We started off with the strawberry mimosas! (Mimosas for breakfast, why not?! It was 5&#39;o clock somewhere.) I&#39;ve had them in other flavors but not strawberry, I loved these.

I went in with my heart set on french Toast since I have been craving some good french toast for weeks now! I couldn&#39;t decide between which to get, but I ended up choosing the Stuffed French Toast which had fresh sliced strawberries, cream cheese stuffing, and topped with whipped cream. OMG! Let me tell you this one may be top 3 of the BEST french toast I&#39;ve ever had! I pretty much demolished the entire thing! Highly recommended. 

My cousin had the Florentine Bennie. I tried a bite and it was delish! She was highly satisfied with her choice as well.

As far as service, the waitress was nice and checked up onus frequently. And our food came out so fast, which was a plus since I was starving.

It consists two large potato pancakes with cheese egg and bacon,  When I got it, it looked ok on outside,after eating almost half thinking it tastes bad , I then looked closely and both pancakes were bunt on the side that wasn&#39;t  showing. Took forever for our waitstaff person to come back.  Also we never got a side of pancakes for my friends  meal.   When she did come, and we told her about potato pancakes she says &#34;oh I thought someone brought those to you&#34;. She did ask if I wanted something else but everyone else was almost done eating, so I said what about a couple of pancakes to go,  she should have offered to comp the potato pancakes.  And it took forever to get the two pancakes ,  she even said, &#34;I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s taking so long&#34;"

Had the carrot cake pancakes...BORING! No carrot cake flavor, a few chopped pecans on top with some shaved carrots. The cream cheese filling was very good, order it on the side.  The side of ham is very good.
My wife had a healthy scrambler, and asked to not include the turkey sausage. When delivered it looked like the turkey had been cooked into the eggs then removed, a grey mess with the fruit put on the hot plate on a Romaine leaf. Picture the presentation.
There is a place down in Bonita Springs, FL called First Watch that serves carrot cake pancakes that are 5 stars, worth the drive.
Will never go back to Brunch!"

I was disappointed considering all the amazing review this places has, but I just wasn&#39;t that impressed. We usually stick to our local Bartlett favorite spot, but we were celebrating my sister&#39;s birthday and wanted to venture out. I had their eggsquiste sweet potato skillet and it was pretty tasty. It comes with sweet potato tots, ham, apples, gouda cheese and ham. You get to pick which way you have your eggs so I opted for scrambled egg whites. I was pleased with my selection. My son got the chocolate chip pancakes which was a lot of food for a kid menu item.

I guess the reason why i&#39;m only giving it 3 stars was because my husband kind of got ill right after we left... He got the south of the border and within moments of leaving he was just about sick to his stomach.... He was very vocal that he was NOT a fan... 

All in all, I probably wouldn&#39;t go back because I&#39;ve had better breakfast food, but the service here was outstanding. Our food came out super fast. Some advice - maybe get some flavored coffee creamer... I wasn&#39;t a fan of their coffee... I think it was burnt.."

We went in on a friday morning and there wasnt any wait. We were greeted by our server and she brought us coffee right away. I must share that one of the cups she gave us was dirty, had orange lipstick on it, yuck! No big deal though, she brought a clean one right away. 
So we looked over the menu and there were so many yummy things on it. I decided on the stuffed waffle. It was delicious! It was topped with powdered sugar and fresh strawberries. The inside had a pink filling with fresh strawberries and bananas, it was delectable. I was very happy with my meal. It was nice to see that they serve mimosas and bloodies too. I wasnt in the mood for a drink but I will for sure go back and have brunch along with a bloody soon. Check them out, you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Richard walkers, Wildberry, Egg Harbor, etc..  This place wasn&#39;t horrible, but, wasn&#39;t great either.

Pros: Awesome service.  Nice large mimosa (twice size of Richard Walkers for same price).

Cons: I ordered eggs over easy.  Although the yolk was nice and runny, the egg whites were very overcooked.  They were dark brown and crunchy; cooked on too high of heat.  If you look through customer photos you will see how many of the eggs are burnt.  You would think a breakfast place would excell at eggs.  The breakfast potatoes were also sub par.

Overall, not a bad spot for breakfast but not a place I will be back to often."

Every time I have gone to Brunch Cafe I have never left disappointed. The loaded potato pancakes are a huge surprise, the mimosas are exactly what you want, and the coffee never ends. 

This has become one of my staple favorites and for very good reasons. If you&#39;re unhappy with anything kindly ask your server for new hash browns if they are cold, as I have done, or take a crew and share different dishes together to sample as much of the menu as possible. 

My recommendations are to go at least 2 hours before they close. If there is a wait, just be patient, you won&#39;t waste away by the time you get a table. Order a mimosa and coffee and if you&#39;re unsure of what you want that day ask a server. I&#39;ve never been guided poorly.

The sweet potatoes were these mini dumplings at the bottom of a skillet with ham, apples and Gouda cheese! They top this one off with two eggs.

However, the reason they are not getting 5 stars is that they need to change up their menu and come up wth some new dishes.  Maybe they could add Greek pancakes, lentil soup, Greek lemon soup with orzo to their menu.  Pretty much the same menu since they opened.

Their famous potatoes  ( as they refer to them) are not famous in my eyes or taste buds. They appear to be frozen and are not cooked till crisp. I make these at home with fresh potatoes, onion, sweet red pepper and garlic, and trust me mine are not mushy like these.

Their Ruben is very good, and their home made potato chips. They have the best pancakes I have ever tasted. They are not doughy like most restaurants."

It was quite busy here at lunch time on a weekday, and I&#39;m told it&#39;s always like that.  They were quite quick with the food, and the coffee was good as well.  We had their signature brunch french toast, which was particularly nice in that it wasn&#39;t too sweet on the toppings.  We also had the meat and potatoes benedict which also was fine.  It&#39;s in a newer strip mall, and they&#39;ve been there 5 years already (I saw it develop over the years as I pass by here fairly routinely on an annual basis, and had&#39;t realized the time had flown by like that)."

It was as rich and delicious as you would expect, without being overly sweet or filling. A cannoli crepe special included one thin vanilla crepe lightly stuffed with cannoli like cream and a few chocolate chips, topped with pistachios, your choice of eggs and bacon. It took me all of .6 seconds to decide on my meal. BOOM. Hubs enjoyed a massive breakfast burrito and the little one was more than happy grabbing handfuls of scrambled egg and diced potatoes.

While I didn&#39;t really get to see too much of the restaurant, I have to tell you why...

We waited for 20 minutes for brunch on a weekend (no surprise there), but once we ordered our food came out in less than 10 minutes. They really, really know how to turn tables here. And they don&#39;t turn &#39;em and burn &#39;em, they just get your food out quickly and with a friendly smile.

We went in on Thursday afternoon around 1:30pm. Place was pretty empty, not surprised because they close at 2:30pm, so I&#39;d guess normally people come to eat in early hours.

I ordered a simple two eggs with bacon and pancakes, served with potato bites. Bacon and eggs were rather cold, it felt like they were pre cooked already, could have got better from a hotel bfast buffet.  Friend&#39;s portella mushroom was nothing better, lots of cheese - which is unneccesary. Fruit was not fresh either, how difficult is it to serve nice and fresh fruit? 

Pancakes was ok in the whole meal. Rest are horrible.

Latte was ok too, but i wouldn&#39;t want to visit this place again. Too bad and I have no idea how it could get 4 stars rating...."

The service was great and the wait time for our food was not long at all. My boyfriend ordered the meat and potato skillet and half order of bisquits and gravy and I had the stuffed portabello. We both loved our choices but are anxious to go back and try more items off the menu. They offer a big selection and have lunch items available as well. I&#39;d recommend this place!!

This establishment is a professional regarding brunch time cuisine. It took us a good while to even make a decision as to what to eat because EVERYTHING looks so darn FABULOUS. Additionally, I found myself flipping through all 117 pictures posted on Yelp of the different entrees while we waited for our booth. The traditional choices were there... but with a fun flare and creative twist.

I finally narrowed things down to the Signature French Toast and the Flourentine Eggs Benedict... because they were so heavily raved about on Yelp. The waitress was super cool and asked if I was interested in playing some brunch roulette. I said, &#34;yes !&#34; The hubs ordered the brunch chicken and the FIL ordered the Reuben. 

A quick 15-20 minutes later  I covered my eyes and POOF a glorious plate of Signature French Toast with strawberries, kiwi, and vanilla infused icing was placed in front of me, ready to be devoured.

Not a bite was spared. 

This place is PERFECT for brunches, delicious food, a family meal, and an opportunity for a good time with great food.  Cannot wait to go back!"

Had I known what I was missing I might not have let it sit idly pending, but the past is the past. I loved it. 

In previous years, I&#39;ve had a personal Quest for the Best challenge, and one of the criteria was Best Eggs Benedict. I mention this, because the BC was the catalyst to resurrect that challenge...however it&#39;s going to be extremely difficult to find a contender to compete the Brunch Cafe&#39;s solid, top spot on the list. The decor is modern, and cozy; It&#39;s got the charming bustle of a diner; and the menu is impressive. Tea drinkers should be pleased with their &#39;tea board&#39; which offers small samples of the blends they offer, so you can interact with the tea before making a blind selection based on the name (it&#39;s a nice touch). I guess the Scrambler plates leave something to be desired, but one cannot help get food envy when a scrambler is delivered side by side with the eggs benedict. 

Needless to say, I&#39;m a fan. I&#39;ve recommended Brunch Cafe to friends and family (and a stranger once which was a little awkward, but oh well) so I&#39;ll certainly be back for more. Honestly though, it&#39;ll be very tough to try something new knowing what I know about the eggs benedict.

[Side note: How many times can I fit &#39;eggs benedict&#39; into a Yelp review? The answer is apparently 4]"

No wait, no crowds. Read great reviews here and wanted to check this place out.  First off, our waitress was very friendly and helpful in answering our questions about what was &#39;popular&#39; and her recommendations.  Service was outstanding also.  Came with 2 friends who ordered the caliente omelet (this was enormous and looked like what an omelet should look like, big and fluffy ). She said it was delicious!  My other friend and I both had the south beach scrambler.  We tried a side of biscuits and gravy, biscuits were very tender and fresh, sausage gravy was tasty and not greasy or heavy.  I enjoyed these!  South beach scrambler has spinach, bacon and avocado with melted montery jack cheese.  This was good, but I assumed the avocado was on the side and not in the scrambler (bad assumption).  I love spinach, and like avocado, but the avocado was a little too overwhelming for me as there was a lot of it in the scrambler, lots of spinach too, but that didn&#39;t bother me.  Avocado can be a bit heavy so I would have preferred less and couldn&#39;t even finish half of my order.  Brunch potatoes were pretty simple and could have been served warmer.  We tried a side of buttermilk pancakes also and these were pretty good!  Everyone commented that they tasted something sweet in the batter...not sure what it is, I&#39;ll have to ask the waitress next time.  They were decent though. Kindof of creamy, but fluffy...these were different.
Next time I would try the omelet or eggs benedict, lots of menu options..  I will be back though.  Our food was served in less than 10 minutes!!  No lie!!  Super fast, attentive service.  Kudos to our waitress, she checked on us constantly!!  Very impressed."

There was a bit of a wait (they will announce your party over the loudspeaker, but it&#39;s hard to hear inside - you can wait outside and hear it better). There aren&#39;t many places to sit and wait (it&#39;s a pretty small place). Luckily it didn&#39;t take too long and we were seated at a booth within 20 minutes.

The service was great, the atmosphere is cozy and clean, and the menu is my favorite part! So many things to choose from, and many of the items are unique that I have not seen at many other places.

Not only did they not put any extra in the order, it probably had less than it normally would have had I not said anything. 

Their sweet and sour chicken is truly gross, with mostly dark chicken pieces with a ton of sauce that thoroughly overwhelms the dish. Overall, I&#39;d visit Ye&#39;s Chinese any day over Mr. Wok, a short distance to the west, and continue ordering Chinese food that generally never disappoints."

I had remembered someone talking about this place before, so we decided to try them out, AND they deliver to our house - score!

The Egg Drop Soup and Hot and Sour Soup were awesome. I normally hate hot and sour soup, but there&#39;s something about babybaking that makes me just love the hell out of it. My daughter loved the egg drop soup and scarfed it.

I was really surprised when we ordered the Chicken and Mixed vegetables and the sauce actually tasted like something. That&#39;s how I knew we had ordered from the place right by us for too long. Sauces are actually supposed to TASTE like things, craziness! 

The man got mongolian beef and he dug it, said it reheated well the next day too when he brought it for lunch. I was all about the Chicken Fried Rice and Crab Rangoon. The insides are cream cheesy, but they taste good, and the outside is golden, crispy, and goood.


This place had better food than the place right by our house, and the prices were much better. We&#39;ll definitely be ordering from here again. I&#39;m sure i&#39;ll be craving the hot and sour soup soon enough.

Delivery was nice and speedy, too. Which is good, because I get ravenous and grumpy. You do not want to see a ravenous, angry pregnant irish woman. You just don&#39;t, man."

When you first get there it looks extremely small but once inside its spacious and looks like a very upbeat and cool place to eat at. The menús are on some computer screens so those are easy to read but It took the lady at the counter like 15 minutes to take our order even tho we were the only ones in there. Also a weird and kind of annoying thing was that she wouldn&#39;t let us order one drink to share. We sat down and waited for our food which didn&#39;t take a long time to be brought to us. We ordered the small spicy orange chicken to share for $6.50 ish. Which we were glad we did because it was so much food. Their white rice is very good but the orange chicken was a bit too saucy for my taste. Besides that it was an excellent experience.

I wanted to see if Mr. Wok fit the bill.

The place is clean and relatively new. I scanned the menu for something a little out of the ordinary, and found it in the Panang Curry with Chicken. With an egg roll I spent $6.75, tax included, which is a bargain.

I sat down, and not 2 minutes later, the meal comes out. As can be expected, $6.75 buys you an enormous amount of food - I have more than enough for leftovers tomorrow. Fried rice is standard with the lunch special, which I also appreciated.

The curry was simple but hot... certainly not complex but I&#39;m not complaining either. The veg was tender. The chicken was... uhh... ephemeral. I shouldn&#39;t be able to use that word for chicken, but... it had little flavor and absolutely no bite. I think next time I&#39;ll try the beef, and hopefully in the future the restaurant can use fresh chicken, sauteed properly.

On the brighter side of things the eggroll was very crisp and went well with their sweet and sour sauce.

No fortune cookie served with the food or on the way out, which was a bummer. Overall though I&#39;d come back to Mr. Wok."

Its basically a tiny notch above panda express. The biggest plus about this place is the speed in which they churn out the food. My orders usually take about 4-6 minutes to be ready. That is pretty damn impressive even for chinese take out. Quality is a mixed bag some things are good, some aren&#39;t. 

So far I had the: 

Fried Potstickers (Around 5 bucks): these things are awful and I&#39;m pretty sure they are frozen store bought. 

Small Szechuan Beef($7.00): It tastes like a spicy sweet and sour beef. They should rename it Szechuan vegetables with Beef because its mostly vegetables. 

Beef Chow fun($10.00): Not too bad, but still needs more meat. 

Considering the time it takes to finish an order. I would definitely put this in the fast food category so compared to KFC or McDonalds or BK, this place is pretty darn good. 

Also the atmosphere has a chain restaurant feel. They clearly hired some marketing people to decorate and design the interior. Its a nice touch."

The girl at the front desk was rude and very unpleasant with myself and the guy that came in behind me. Regardless to language barriers that exist in our world, friendly customer service goes a long way. As I waited she called someone who had placed a big order that she was bagging, and suddenly she yells at them saying that if they were going to cancel the order they should have called and she slammed the receiver down. They probably cancelled the order because they found a better spot with better food and better service! No wonder the place is always empty.

When you step inside there&#39;s a few tables to sit and eat at, a large menu board directly above the counter, and a soda fountain.

In visiting Mr. Wok I decided to try a few different items. General Tso&#39;s chicken, pot stickers, crab rangoon and the fried rice that came with the chicken. My overall opinion is that the food is average. The general tso&#39;s chicken wasn&#39;t very spicy and was more sweet. It had a good flavor and I&#39;d eat it again. The fried rice with the chicken was pretty good though a bit cold. The crab rangoons were mostly cream cheese and weren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but were decent. The pot stickers were a bit of a disappointment as they seemed a bit over cooked to where the outside had a harder more rubbery texture than most places.

Overall my food was decent and I would go back since it&#39;s near my office. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to visit, but I give it a recommendation if you&#39;re in the area and looking for Chinese take out."

My husband loved their pork egg fu yung and I enjoyed the kung pao chicken, along with the eggroll + fried rice that came with! Great serving sizes, enough to take home, super fast (literally like 5minute wait after placing an order). And with them using fresh ingredients (no msg ever!), we felt not as guilty eating here.

We have gone back twice already and had delivery for dinner during one of the Hawks finals and no complaints on any items.  Their noodles were great, as was the BBQ pork, plenty of meat and shrimp in their dishes.  Well worth the money for decent Chinese food in the suburbs!"

Taking into consideration cultural differences and all still doesn&#39;t call for treating customers poorly. When I called in a delivery order I asked for a small order of an entrée from the menu. I was told that it only came in large.  I told them that I wanted it in small. The menu says it comes in two sizes. I was told that the menu was wrong and that small wasn&#39;t an option.  After going back and forth about honoring what the menu says, they refused to do so. I know this may not be a big deal to most but if I was kindly told something along the lines of &#34;we&#39;re sorry that we haven&#39;t been able to update the menu so as a courtesy we&#39;ll honor the price but going forward please know that the menu is wrong...&#34; bla bla bla.

Food:
Good food for the price. Lunch Specials are about $6.25 and has enough to make you save leftovers. Some dishes really shine for the price, but you gotta take the time to find them. The Panang Curry Chicken, Pepper Steak, and Honey Chicken are some that I discovered. The Crab Rangoons are da bomb! A much better alternative to Panda Express, but won&#39;t beat Chinatown standards.

Service:
Fast and Friendly. Enough said. If you show up when it&#39;s not busy, you can sometimes get your food made in 3 minutes!  

Atmosphere:
Always clean. Nice color coordination. Easy on the eyes.

Pro Tip: Don&#39;t get the MSG Fried Rice that comes with every lunch special. Ask for White Rice. Your body will Thank You!

There are too many restaurants out there happy to serve new business- this place apparently doesn&#39;t need new customers.

So, after a long weekend of doing home renovations we decided on bbq. I suggested this place and since it was about a twenty min drive, we decided not to call for takeout but wash up and go dine-in. 

When we arrived it was 7:45pm (just fifteen minutes until the posted close time on the door.) The hostess said it was too late to eat here but we could order takeout. Then she briskly led us through the large restaurant to the back where we were supposed to order takeout.

In my whole life, this has never happened to me. We were tired from working all day, so we placed our order for takeout and sat on a little bench in front of the serving line. A woman behind the register identified herself as the owner&#39;s sister-in -law.

She was personable yet complained to us that a party of 15 just arrived before us with no reservations (the restaurant  was about 3/4 empty.) I explained that yes my husband &amp; I also just arrived too but we were escorted back to her at take out ( I was thinking perhaps maybe she would seat us and apologize for being told we were too late But no. That didn&#39;t happen.)

While we waited for our dinner, I saw two plates that were sent back to the kitchen because we were literally sitting next to the food pass. When our food was ready, we left without fanfare. 

When we arrived home my baked potato was cold and my baby back ribs were warm. I nuked the potato for 3 mins. My baked potato was not fully cooked in the middle. My ribs tasted alright but they were so tough they had to be cut off the bone with a knife. My husband liked the brisket, but we were still mystified at being turned away for seating while there were clearly people (including the party of 15 ) that had just been seated. The cornbread &amp; coleslaw was good, but it&#39;s doubtful we will return."

My friend ordered the steak sandwich. I tried some. The steak had good flavor and was made to order. The garlic bread was crisp. The garlic mash potatoes tasted fresh and tasted like they had been just made.

I had the platter. The Brisket was disappointing. It seemed dry. Slattered it with bbq to make it taste better. Bq chicken was a little better and more moist with smoke flavor. Still wasn&#39;t blown away. I enjoyed the Mac and cheese. It was creamy with out being over powered with salt.

Came here with my wife off a $16 for $30 Groupon last night. Let&#39;s begin with the service. Our waitress was nice, however, she was kind of nonchalant in her pace. I just felt like she wasn&#39;t as quick and efficient as I would expect from a waitress on a busy Friday night. Maybe it&#39;s just me.

Food was ok. I got the pulled pork plate with baked beans. It also came with cornbread and coleslaw. Nothing on that plate was really phenomenal. The pulled pork was good, seasoned well &amp; not dry. The flavors just didn&#39;t jump out at me. Same with the baked beans. The cornbread was pretty good in my opinion. The coleslaw was nasty. To be fair though, I generally don&#39;t like coleslaw so it takes some phenomenal coleslaw to please me.

I got a banana Pudding to go. They put it in this tight little 4oz container. I wasn&#39;t pleased with the size of it with it costing $5. I can go to like pappadeaux and get a jar full for the same price. Overall, my meal was ok. Nothing to brag about but not terribly horrible."

My three sides were, Mac&amp;cheese, baked beans  and Cole slaw. I arrived around 7pm to this location. 

The cole slaw was good (creamy), the baked beans were good and the Mac &amp; Cheese needed salt. The brisket had absolutely zero flavor, it was moist but with zero flavor. The rib tips were 95% cartledge and the spicy sausage was alright. I had an ice tea for my drink. The three meat plater was $18.99 and I substituted the corn bread for a different item, which was an additional 0.49 cents.

My server / service was almost invisible, I was checked on only once and by that time, I was almost done eating what little I did eat. I stated to her (my server) that the brisket had no flavor at all. She offered to replace it with another meat. I saw at least two, but I believe three female servers and when I was there, the restaurant was not packed at all, customers were there yes, but was it packed, no.

My total was $24.28 and I have zero intention on going back."

We had the pulled pork platter and Texas brisket platter. Each included coleslaw, cornbread, and one side. The pulled pork platter was on point. The meat was tender and had a delicious bbq sauce that was too overpowering. As far as the brisket, I so not recommend this dish. It had very little flavor and looked almost as if it was cooked in the microwave. I had the Mac and cheese for a side, but they were bland.

Now onto the service. My order was takeout and the man taking my order lacked interpersonal skills and customer service. He definitely lacked in customer service skills and was not friendly. But I like to give people the benefit of the doubt so maybe he was having a bad day. Also when I went to pick up my order, the staff sounded confused and were not sure of which order belonged to me.

Putting aside the service, the food was decent and I would return to try some of their other entrees."

I&#39;m not sure if my taste for barbecue has changed since some world-class barbecue restaurants opened in and around Chicago, but I was not as impressed as I&#39;ve been in the past.

Started off with a Bloody Mary - they had a special that day, Bloody Mary&#39;s for $2. They use their barbecue sauce in their mix and the taste is pronounced. It adds a sweetness I&#39;m not used to in this drink. I can&#39;t say I really liked it, and I think I know why it was only $2 - very little vodka and no condiments.

The meal - I had their brisket meal with red beans and rice. The beans and rice was very good. The brisket was dry and flavorless unfortunately. Service sometimes can make up for a meal, but no so much here. I can&#39;t say it was bad, but it wasn&#39;t good either.

I was disappointed in this one. Too bad. I like barbecue and this is still the closest one to our home."

We use their BBQ sauce all the time at home and expected more from this place.  We tried five meats - brisket, burnt ends, smoked turkey, smoked wings and ribs.  The ribs were dry.  The rest of them were moist but not much smokey flavor, only doused with sauce. The wings were supposedly fried but were not crispy.  Also, one of the wings had feather still on it - gross!! The brisket was the best out of all the meats.

At the end of the day, we can make almost all at home in the smoker and it tastes at least as good if not better. Disappointed.  We tried because of a groupon but won&#39;t be back."

My husband is from Kansas City so he&#39;s tough to please when it comes to barbeque. Prior to trying Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s last year he hadn&#39;t had barbeque in the Chicago area that he really liked. Yet we love this place! We were told that they smoke all of their meats, and that would be the difference. We use the sauce at home...it&#39;s sweet but tangy and goes well with any barbequed, grilled, or smoked meat.

This time we had the jumbo wing appetizer (free, thanks to the Yelp check in) the gumbo, which had just the right amount of kick, the 3-meat platter and brisket platter; each with cole slaw, corn bread, and choice of side. The ribs were delicious, as was the pulled pork and burnt ends, and the beef brisket was the most tender I&#39;ve ever had. I like &#34;Smoque&#34; in the city, but this place is still better!!

After all of this, we were too full for dessert. Service was great too. Definitely worth the trip to Elk Grove Village. Five stars!!"

brisket was ok

Coleslaw was meh

The &#34;manager&#34; Mike Vodin, set the tone for anything named Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s in the future.  

My wife purchased a groupon for this restaurant.  We went this past Friday night. (4-15-16).  When we arrived, there was a couple sitting at the bar that we knew.  They were going to sit at the bar and eat.  I suggested all of us sit at a high top in the bar so we could talk easier.  They paid their bill at the bar and moved to our table.  When the waitress came over, my wife told her that we had a groupon.  The other couple said that they had one too.  The waitress told us that we could only use one groupon per table.  We explained that the other couple was from the bar and they were going to use their groupon and we were here separately going to use ours.  She said she was not allowed to do that.  We asked to see the manager.  A few minutes later the &#34;manager&#34; came to our table.  We explained our story and was told in a &#34;dees dems does&#34; wanna be attitude, &#34;we got rules here&#34;, &#34;I can&#39;t let you do that, I&#39;d have to let everyone else do it&#34;.  All of a sudden I was back in first grade.  This manger also stated that these groupons make us lose money.  Customers take advantage of us.  I looked around and noticed that the place was pretty empty for a Friday night that the Blackhawks were playing in the playoffs on tv.  I remember thinking that the place should of been packed.   But, we all stayed together and had dinner.  

The food part of this review is ok, but nothing to write home about.  The presentation and taste was good. The portions were good sized.  At least they have a good cook.  It&#39;s just that the management staff is horrible.  Getting into a conversation with a customer about the restaurant loosing money is unacceptable in ANY situation.  They seemed to be displeased about us even using one groupon.  Complaining that they weren&#39;t making as much money with &#34;these groupons&#34;.  I&#39;m not a big groupon or coupon guy.  But one thing I do know is that coupons or groupons are supposed to get you in the door.  It&#39;s up to the restaurant to make you want to come back.  This &#34;manager&#39; set the tone for the dinner, even though the waitress and food were ok.  We&#39;ll think long and hard about EVER getting involved with anything named Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s.  It&#39;s really too bad.  The building is beautiful, this food was good, the drinks were good.  Manager Mike, told us that the General Manager (Richard Jurczak) makes the rules.  So, I&#39;m not sure, but maybe the problem here starts at the very top. The management is running this restaurant into the ground, with the attitude that the customers take advantage of us.  The CUSTOMERS ARE EVERYTHING TO YOU!!  EVERYTHING.  THERE IS NOTHING ELSE.  I hope the owners or franchisees or whatever, figure this out quick.  The management in this restaurant is poison."

The curb appeal on this particular day leaves something lacking to be desired. The Gumbo dish was outstanding. The amount of meat was worth the price of what was paid
 The nachos we&#39;re the best I ever had. The meat was heavy you got more than u can bargain for. You really need four at the table. I recommend adding the brisket. And some BBQ sauce. I have never been filled and more satisfied with a BBQ joint. The quality control and level of commitment to there product and brand gives them a 4 out of 5 in my book."

Having read many of the other reviews, I tried my best to go in without any preconceptions. I should state that where we live near Bartlett, there are three excellent barbecue places to go to. That said, we like the barbecue sauce, so we figured the food should be OK. First, the brisket. As other people have stated, it was very dry. The only parts of the brisket that tasted great were those that had been well saturated in barbecue sauce. The one piece that had no barbecue sauce on it was dry and virtually tasteless. The chicken was excellent, and by the chicken, I mean the barbecued chicken that came with the three meat platter. The St. Louis ribs were very tasty, mostly because of the aforementioned barbecue sauce. It seems to me that they boil the ribs before they bake them, which some places do in order to make them fall off the bone tender. That said, the ribs were not terribly fatty, they were meaty, and well worth the ordering. The sides weren&#39;t terribly remarkable, and were much the same as you&#39;d get it any other barbecue joint. We went early on a Friday evening, and the place was only about half full. I mention that because the service was a bit on the slow side. It was alright as we were not in any great rush. Would we go back again? Not really. They didn&#39;t prove to be any great competition to the aforementioned three great places that are near our home. As others have said, the food wasn&#39;t terrible, but it wasn&#39;t great either."

The only reason I took a star off was the 2nd piece of the sandwich was overloaded with pimento cheese, to the point it was not easy to pick up and eat.  Other than that it was on point to what I am used to getting when I am back home in the south.  The pimento cheese was different than what I am used too but had just enough kick to it.

The restaurant was very crowded that day so not sure if that was the reason but I was definitely not happy with the ribs. The pulled pork was ok but for a place that is known for their ribs I would expect them to always be stellar! 

The service was also not good that day. Our waitress would go MIA for long periods of time to the point that I had to flag another waitress to send us our waitress since we needed a soda refill!! Hopefully this was just an off scenario since the previous time I remember the ribs were a whole lot better.

And I&#39;d be in town to check it out. Overall it was a very nice experience. Food was great, waitress was attentive, and prices were decent.

I was in town on a business trip by myself and looking for a late night restaurant. They&#39;re not super late, but it worked with my schedule. It was relatively empty by the time I got there but thankfully no funny attitudes from any workers for being one of the last customers of the night.

The menu isn&#39;t huge but it does specialize in BBQ, specifically their wet sweet style. I got a full rack of ribs with cornbread and coleslaw. Pretty good. Half the ribs were a little tougher then usual but it&#39;s always hard to gauge rib quality until you actually bite down into them. Food came out in a decent amount of time and the waitress made sure to check on me several times. Gave me some recommendations as well.

I was at a table near the bar the place was very clean, noise levels pretty decent (not too loud), and several TVs were on with various sports playing. They have outdoor seating as well.

If you&#39;re in town I&#39;d recommend giving it a shot. I&#39;d be surprised if you didn&#39;t enjoy it. The only reason I&#39;m knocking a star off is because it doesn&#39;t offer dry rub ribs and some of the ribs I had were a little tough. If I go back and the ribs are a bit better or they got my favorite dry rub style offered, it&#39;ll probably be a 5 star."

Ribs were cold dried out and tough, most everything else was cold, they didn&#39;t serve items offered in previous year brunches ( seriously, no corn bread or shrimp?)

First issue was walking in and not smelling BBQ I expected real authentic BBQ for the good ole Chicago BBQ sauce. Service was okay took about 5 mins to get a waitress and it wasn&#39;t many people in the place. Got a rib platter with tips , baked potato, smoked turkey and Cole slaw...best thing was the baked potato because everything needed seasoning bad, not even the BBQ sauce saved it from tasting bland. You could taste that the ribs were boiled and not barbecued which was disappointing. My boyfriend had tips as well and it was barely cut up, he also had the pull pork which didn&#39;t have bread with it which was kinda odd but his food also lacked seasoning, thank God for the groupon because I wouldn&#39;t have paid full price for the food, decided we won&#39;t be back here, expected the food to be way better based off reviews and the BBQ sauce it&#39;s self.

You can tell they are trying and the place is clearly no dump.  Attentive service and full of regulars.  Don&#39;t want to be too critical, as they have some good preps and superior food quality.  Green chili mac and cheese is interesting in a good way.  Brisket was a little dry and lacks some of the smoke I&#39;m used to from the better places.  Ribs were very good.  Slaw is the style I prefer.

What is important to note are the wings.  Fabulous crispness, flavor, and quality.  Come here for the wings!  I did not concentrate enough on how they could be sauced, but they were superb.  Overall I want to give it another star, but will have to come back and see.  Solid place for BBQ in Chicagoland."

The staff was nice. The food was decent. The ambiance of the establishment is non-existent. The sandwich was 5 slices of beef with some barbecue sauce on a bun that was right out of the bag. There was a side of lukewarm fries. Nothing else. No garnish, no coleslaw, no pickle. I&#39;ll admit, the meat was delicious and I think the entree is a better deal than the sandwich. The place was crowded, so that says something - but I don&#39;t get it."

I don&#39;t know if our server was in the wrong mood that day or overworked from having to cover more tables than usual, but she was definitely not the nicest person.  Moment we were seated by the teenager host, she asked if we were ready to order drinks and food before even having a chance to open up the menu.  Since we didn&#39;t even look at the drink menu, along with my mom not being the drinker and ordered water and I ordered a sprite to start with and we were going to look at the menu for food a bit.  Wrong answer.  She quickly came back with the water and sprite (which really tasted like they were getting low on the syrup in the soda machine), she basically threw them on the table and stomped away.  When we were ready to order food, she was nowhere in sight and when she was, she was very pushy and trying to be quick, not even welcome to answer any questions my mom had (which like every older 60+ mother, she had a few questions).  As I said, food was good, I had the smoked meat loaf with mashed potatoes, onion strings, and grilled veggies (mom had 2 meat platter with a side of fries).  Didn&#39;t see the server until we were done and check was given, that was all she wrote."

The food can be awesome on one visit and so-so the next.  Ditto the service.  Whether the restaurant is busy or not doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference.

Our most recent visit was on a Sunday evening.  There were few other customers present, which does not explain the less-than-attentive service we experienced.  Our St. Louis ribs, which we enjoyed on a previous visit, were warmed-over, ends as hard as tree bark.  We had to glop on extra BBQ sauce to compensate for the dry, overcooked meat.

About 10 minutes into the meal, our server finally came over to ask how everything was.  We told her in no uncertain terms.  She replied, &#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; and walked away (if you&#39;re not going to fix the problem, then why bother to ask?).

So the next day, I sent a polite email to the restaurant using the link on the &#34;Contact Us&#34; webpage.  The email promptly bounced.  Plan B: I filled out the &#34;Contact Us&#34; form on the same page and then clicked &#34;Send Message.&#34;  That was several weeks ago and I received no response.

And restaurants wonder why some customers never return."

I was a bit afraid after reading the bad reviews, but our experience was great. The friendly waitress even helped me with the Yelp check-in deal (free appetizer) because it was my first time using it.

The place was not busy when we came in (just before 5pm), and we liked the music selection they played in the background (classic rock with some hair metal thrown it). Service was quick, food was delicious. Did not need to ask for refills on ice tea.

The only issue was that they advertised garlic mashed potatoes with the corn beef/cabbage dinner, but we got baby taters and carrots instead. No problem because they were super tender. Portion was big with lots of the real corn beef."

Ordered the 3 meat platter - St Louis Ribs, beef brisket and KC style burnt ends...   None of the meat had any flavor at all...  I understand that it&#39;s a restaurant based on their BBQ sauce, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the meat has to be so bland...

Brisket was over cooked and almost to tough.

Burnt ends tasted like they were finished on a BBQ grill, rather than with smoke.

Ribs were just plain as well, nothing to write home about...

Overall - Don&#39;t expect ANY flavor from the meat..   The BBQ is required if you want any taste to your meal...  BBQ in Chicago isn&#39;t good to start with and this place is not even up to par for Chicago BBQ...  Drive on by..."

The second was it had to be something good! And the last thing I was looking for was something with plenty of options because I was unsure of what they might enjoy.

My boss had suggested some crappy restaurant with bad reviews around the corner from our office and I thought SBR&#39;s would at least be something new they may not have had before and being Chicago based, I thought that might add a little fun to the mix. 

Off we go for lunch around 2 or so. Yes a bit late but I figured we might get some better service if they&#39;re not busy. 

We walked in and no one was there to greet us. Boo SBR&#39;s!  We waited a few moments while they set up a table for 5 in an almost empty restaurant and we took our seats. 

It took a few minutes the be greeted by a server and when we finally were, it was a woman whom made me feel as if we were interrupting her day be eating here. Well let me tell you something, miss grumpy pants, service with a just a little smile can go a long way.

So lets start with getting our drinks...I swear that our server went to another restaurant down the road to get them. It must have taken 8 minutes. What the heck?!

Of the five of us, three of us ordered a side salad or soup. The soup came out almost immediately. The salads about 10 minutes later. The food, before the ladies were even done with their salads...they really need to work on timing. It was a joke. 

The food was good. The quality is there. The portions are excellent. They could actually offer half portions for a discounted price, if they wanted to open up their market to more people. The salads were huge and the two grown men at our table, with strong appetites were not able to finish their salads. A half portion would have been ideal for lunch for someone like myself. 

They do offer a $10 lunch dealio that includes a soft drink or iced tea. Not a bad offer. But cut the potion down and make it a $7.50 deal!

The guests we had with us, are on some sort of diet where they aren&#39;t allowed sugars or carbs. They explained this to our server. Reviewed their menu options and even the server told them specifically that their BBQ sauce has a lot of sugar in it. The ladies split a burger that was topped with pulled pork and onions and to their surprise the pulled pork was covered in BBQ sauce. So they ended up sending back their food to be remade with &#34;sauce-less&#34; pulled pork. After further discussion, it appeared the menu didn&#39;t state the BBQ sauce on the burger and being that the ladies chatted with the server about their dietary restrictions, you would think she would have mentioned the pulled pork had the sauce on it. Kinda disappointing. 

I asked the server to wrap up my leftovers for me and I got the snotty response of &#34;I&#39;ll bring you a box&#34;. Now, let me tell you something, I totally respect and understand company policies but there are better ways to respond to my request such as &#34;I wish I could but were not allowed...could I bring you a box instead?&#34; or &#34;actually we&#39;re not allowed to wrap up food, but I would be happy to bring you a container.&#34; 

It&#39;s all about service, people. If you don&#39;t like being a server, go find something else to do. Servers make money by providing good service and satisfying their tables enough so that the table wants to leave them a huge tip for their hard work during their visit. That&#39;s the hospitality industry. That&#39;s serving. Either you&#39;re in or your out. 

Not sure I&#39;ll be rushing back anytime soon. I&#39;m kinda sad because I am a Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s fan and even discovered during lunch conversation that one of the ladies from Texas uses SBR&#39;s BBQ sauce back at home!"

Very disappointed. The food was greasy, warm and lacking flavor. Had the fried pickles as an app and couldn&#39;t even finish them they were so greasy. Had the three meat plate, sausage, brisket and tips. The sausage looked like a hot dog and tasted worse. The brisket was dry and flavorless. The tips were chunks of fat burnt to look like meat. To top off this experience our server (the bartender) made us feel like we were an interruption to her evening. At one point I asked for Tabasco sauce and she said they didn&#39;t have any. On the bar was a bottle in clear sight. She couldn&#39;t be pulled away from her drink she was enjoying from behind the bar. I couldst touch any of my food it was so poor that I had it wrapped up and threw it in the trash when I got home.

The sauce drowned out any bit of smokiness . Also we didn&#39;t taste any seasoning or rub?The same thing with the pork the meat was tender but no flavor what&#39;s so ever.

Baby let me tell you, I didn&#39;t have to add anything to this gumbo, deliciously spicy, almost too spicy but not quite. Just enough rice and made with real andouille (I could tell).  So delicious and the cornbread miniloaf that comes with the meal was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. We ended up taking meat home as we got full before we could finish the generous portion that comes with the two meat plates.

Checking in on Yelp scores you a free appetizer so make sure you do. The staff was very friendly and we were seated immediately. For the free appetizer we got the nachos. They were huge and filling and between the two of us we had a lot leftover. For entrees I had the two meat and chose rib tips with wings and a side of fries. The dinner also comes with coleslaw and bread. I thought that the wings were good but the tips had a lot of fat on them. There was barely any meat. I prefer rips tips from Famous Daves because there wouldn&#39;t have been this much fat on them. So I wasn&#39;t really pleased with my tips but the wings were good and fries well fries are basic.

After all, I use the Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s BBQ sauce at home after ditching another brand several years ago.

I did everything backwards the last time I visited SBRBBQ. I had the Texas Brisket Sandwich for $10.99. It really tasted good but made me even hungrier. Have you ever eaten something so good that instead of getting full, you just get more hungrier? My son in law really took advantage of the situation and ordered this plate of food that had no end in sight. So as I sat there watching him pig out on the BBQ Platter I checked in on Yelp and scored a free appetizer.

I decided to get The BBQ Lovers Platter Appetizer. So I started with an entree and ended with an appetizer. And boy was this thing packed with a lot of meat with the BBQ flavor just oozing out everywhere. I can&#39;t believe this plate was an appetizer, and now I can see why it was $10.99. Of course, I did share it with all of my dining companions. This app had KC Burnt Ends but believe me when I tell you that the description &#34;Burnt Ends&#34; does not do justice to the amount of food that there was. And it sure didn&#39;t taste burnt to me. They also had sliced sausages along with onion strings (FORGOT TO TAKE PICTURES). Everything tasted fabulous and our waiter really did a good job making sure everybody was having a good time."

Wife had a 2 meat combo - ribs and beef brisket, and I also had a 2 meater - ribs and KC burnt ends.  The beef brisket was really good.  KC burnt ends are the beef brisket ends - I had not tried before, and they were meaty and drier than beef brisket.  Good to try, but I&#39;ll probably stick with regular beef brisket next time.  The ribs got most of the flavor from the nice tasting sauce, and were on smaller side.  Basically, they could have been better I think.   Still a great place to frequent, but not quite 5 stars on the BBQ.  The sizes of the sides were generous.  Beer selection is decent and I had a Ranger IPA for $5.50."

However, the first impression of this location was that of an overly commercialized chain restaurant. I couldn&#39;t even smell smoke outside.

The inside was much like a Perkins, so boring. I ordered the ribs and brisket and my partner, the smoked turkey. The ribs simply we&#39;re not tender - I could barely cut them apart. The flavor was there just because they slapped it with that famous sauce. The brisket and turkey almost seemed like they were parboiled and let to sit in a cold smoke. Tender, but not freshly smoked. Service wasn&#39;t all that spectacular either. All in all, very disappointed. Was hoping for authenticity."

I also love their sauce. So I was very excited to finally make it to the restaurant. 

It started off good because they did not give my boyfriend and me a hard time about having a restaurants.com gift certificate (you just never know sometimes). And we also sat outside on a pretty nice patio. But when the food came, I was rather disappointed. My chicken tortilla soup was only ok. I&#39;ve had better. And the pulled pork sandwich was nothing like the delicious sliders at church. Many of the pieces of pork were so hard that it hurt my teeth to bite down. And the macaroni and cheese was dry and didn&#39;t have much flavor.

If anything I guess the portions were a decent size.  We certainly didn&#39;t leave hungry.  But overall, I was not all that impressed. But it was good enough for me to probably go back to use my free appetizer coupon. And I will for sure still by their sauce at the store."

My family of 4 went for a lunch meal in a pretty empty restaurant. We were surprised when we waited a few minutes before anybody acknowledged us as we waited to be seated. When I asked her about their incentive program her answer was a short &#34;I don&#39;t know?&#34; Not a let me find out, just I can enter you in and I&#39;m not sure. After being seated we waited 5 minutes for the waitress to show up and ask us for drinks. She appeared to be In a hurry taking our order and didn&#39;t bother to tell us about the burger specials (we found out when she told the table seated next to us about 20 minutes later). She must have been more concerned about the small party that was wrapping up (the only others in the restaurant when we arrived). Another group of 6 came in and left after they were ignored for too long. The food was cold, which is something if I am saying it because I don&#39;t mind warm food as opposed to hot.  My wife&#39;s 1/3 slab of ribs were cold and tough and the burnt ends I longed for were dry (unlike what I remebered them as). We got our carry out containers, and weren&#39;t even given a bag to hold them, even though another table received one. The best part of the experience was leaving.

A little weak on the beer selection, but I&#39;m guessing this isn&#39;t a beer snob kind of place, so cut them some slack. Great, BIG cocktails and nice wine list...

The food was OK - good, the service was very friendly, but spotty and the ambience was great.

Had a Groupon that was $28 for a $50 deal for food only - I may have gotten a discount on it as well. So I met a longtime friend of mine as its location is equidistant from both of us - about 25 miles from different directions. I got there before he did and sat in the bar as the hostess that sat me indicated we could get dinner there. She asked me if there was anything I wanted, so I indicated I was interested in a glass of wine and she brought me a wine list. Not a lot of people in the bar at that time and a few in the restaurant, so I get the impression that one or both of the hostesses will be involved in the serving process at our table. But that never really materialized.

For the most part, the bartender served us from that point on. But as time passed, the bar got busier and he wasn&#39;t really equipped to maintain our order, other people&#39;s orders and make all the drinks too. Now, that said we weren&#39;t in a rush to get anywhere so the slow pace wasn&#39;t disruptive. And as noted the ambience was great (it is a beautiful older hotel) and everyone was friendly, so hanging out was fine. We ordered food - the eggroll appetizer; my friend ordered the lamb and I got an adobo skirt steak. I ordered that medium rare, but it came out medium - not a total surprise as cooking a skirt steak MR isn&#39;t easy - but at a restaurant of this level, it should have been correct. As I made a comment about the missed temperature, my friend commented, &#34;there&#39;s your rare&#34; as he was cutting into his lamb. It was pretty red - a little more so than what it should have been.

Drinkwise, my friend ordered a brandy manhattan which was nicely done and I had a couple of Bordeaux&#39;s which were outstanding. There was a keyboard player / singer and while the sound of the instrumentation there is a little tinny, the musician himself was pretty cool. 

So when it&#39;s all said and done, in my opinion given the type and quality of restaurant that the ROX is, the food fell a bit short and the service somewhat shorter. But the atmosphere was great and the staff was very friendly so I will be back - it is a nice and rather unique place to spend an evening for dinner. Four stars issued because I did have a nice time and that&#39;s what counts."

We were quickly seated in this small dining room.  There were probably only about 20 tables max, but yet it seemed to take forever for anything to happen here.  I was delighted to find out that there was a $6 martini special on Thursdays and when I got my martinis, they were good.  

Our waiter came by to take our order and I started with a bananas foster martini.  Getting our drinks took awhile.  When the waiter came to take our order, we mentioned wanting some raw oysters and then ordered the filet sliders and the oysters.  Our friends ordered a tortilla soup and a Asian chicken salad.  The food took quite awhile to come out, and when it did we were shocked to see that the oysters we received were cooked with spinach and a cream sauce.  Although disappointed, we ate them anyway.  The sliders were excellent and our friends salad and soup were also pretty good.  

The waiter asked me if I&#39;d like another martini and I said yes, put in my order and waited and waited.  Eventually we wanted to switch tables to be closer to the live piano player that they had for the evening.  When I pointed out that he had never brought my drink, he said - &#34;well, I will take it off your bill&#34;.  No kidding.  Do you think I am going to pay for something I didn&#39;t receive?  We moved about five tables over and I couldn&#39;t believe that he wouldn&#39;t offer to then get it for me.  It then took him forever to bring us a check, run our credit card, etc.  We finally just moved and figured he&#39;d find us when he got around to settling our bill.  

The bartender was friendly, came over and brought me a replacement drink fairly quickly.  It is pretty sad that the bartender who is tending the bar and waiting 10 small tables around it can do this quicker than our waiter."

It&#39;s a small place. Dim lighting, pretty romantic. There was also live music and a busy bar when I was there. 

It was was fairly busy for dinner but despite this we were seated right away. I ordered a dirty martini which was great. We decided to share a bunch of appetizers for dinner off of of the small plate menu we ordered the Lumpia, beef egg rolls with chili sauce and the pub chips.  We tried to order the wings and hummus but they were out. Disappointing! Both of the other appetizers were good, especially the Lumpia. Crunchy and flavorful. The pub chips were perfectly seasoned and I really liked the bacon dip. 

I ordered the chicken clam chowder which was recommended to me by the waitress and then again she told me they were out! Not her fault but again disappointing! I opted for the lobster bisque which I really enjoyed. 

I give it three starts because of the fact they ran out of a few things. Everything else was pretty good! I will be back to try it out for dinner."

We had to splurge on dessert because we knew it&#39;d be orgasmic, we were right! I got the devils chocolate fudge cake served with vanilla ice cream. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! The chocolate was so rich and pure. A solid cocoa taste! 

I must say the food presentation is like I&#39;ve never seen. I felt like it was on an episode of top chef where the challenge was to make the most scrumptious food and now try to make it look prettier than it tastes!

It is a pricey option, but great for a special occasion.

It&#39;s located in the historical Baker Hotel right on the river so it can make for a perfect night out... Start with a fancy dinner, walk downtown by the river, hit up some of the fun upscale bars in the area.

The bar is very small, but fun, and their bartenders are wonderful. It&#39;s one of the few places in town to get a well made martini."

We like to eat out and just check out new things. We also had a coupon that should of worked but it didn&#39;t (more on that later).

So since I am a college head coach I have to admit that I am a beer/chicken wing kind of guy. I asked what the pork wings were and the server explained it to me. I asked if it is big and is it compared to Buffalo Wild Wings (my favorite place on Earth). She said it had a bigger portion that Bdubs and that is is a lot better then Bdubs.. So I ordered it. My girlfriend ordered the chicken. So here where everything goes south.

First, the pork wings were terrible. To make things worst...there were ONLY TWO!! And the price for them was NINE DOLLARS! FOR TWO TERRIBLE WINGS!!  You can get 12 wings for the same price at Bdubs that taste a whole lot better. How can she say Bdubs was not as good as those 2 pork wings!! Terrible!!

Second, my girlfriend&#39;s chicken was bland. It was rotissere chicken. We could of eaten a better rotissire chicken at Boston Market for a cheaper price!! I ended up eating it for her.

Third, the coupon we had specifically had an expiration date. However they didn&#39;t take it saying they had to log into something and they couldn&#39;t do it. They did give us a 10 dollar coupon instead so I would have to give them that, but we still wouldn&#39;t of saved as much as we did with that coupon.

I have to admit, the blueberry they put on top of the butter they bring out was quite tasty. 

I personally think this place was a huge rip off. As a college head coach, I like to eat out and especially at the upscale restaurants whenever I go on the road, but this is by far the worst ever. 

And I do think whoever was our waitress was sort of snobby. Just a bad experience."

Update...one hour later, I haven&#39;t puked yet.

By the way, I had the New York steak that was just terrible. My wife had soup that smelled and tasted like Campbell&#39;s soup and the hummus was over seasoned and not good."

I am originally from St. Charles, and have lived in San Diego area over 30 years.  I have always loved the Hotel Baker, and, in fact, got married there 33 years ago.  I had read some reviews of the Rox City Grill, and decided to check it out while in town.

Yesterday, my niece and I went to St. Charles to check out my old &#34;digs&#34; and reminisce a bit. We stopped at the Hotel Baker, thinking we&#39;d have a late lunch, but found out they wouldn&#39;t be serving until 5:30.  When we stepped in the bar, we were immediately greeted by the ultra charming bartender, Joe.  I mentioned to Joe that I had read a bit about him in reviews here on Yelp, and he humbly stated that he had heard he was in some.

We told him we&#39;d be back a bit later for Martini&#39;s and a snack.  Upon our return, about 4 hours later, Joe greeted us both by name, came right over to our table, and took our drink order.  We had fun bantering with him, then off he went to fill our martini orders.

The martinis were great, and at $ 6.00 (which is the Thursday special) a pretty good value, although I prefer martini glasses which are a bit larger.  If I was rating the martinis and Joe- I&#39;d give a solid 4 1/2!

We ordered a couple of appetizers- one which is supposed to be Korean steak you cook yourself, and some Pomme Frites.  The steak- which I&#39;ve had numerous times over the years, is typically marinated and flavorful. This one had NO flavor whatsoever.  It was 5 very tiny slices, for $11.00. Probably the equivalent of about 1 oz of steak.  Not a great eating experience, or value.  The Pomme Frites were OK, if a bit pricey.

They have entertainment, a piano player, who started at 8:30. That seems like a strange time to have him start, mid week, but we were told it is so the diners aren&#39;t disturbed while eating.  It would seem to me, you&#39;d have him start at 7 or 7:30, and play quiet music to dine by- as the bar was pretty darned full of people- and then at least the bar crowd would have a bit of entertainment.  It would seem to me he could play quieter music, maybe suited a bit to the time period of the hotel, and then pick up the volume and/or tempo after the diners leave......... but that&#39;s just my logical business mind thinking here.....

The atmosphere of the bar is nice- I wasn&#39;t too taken with the décor in the dining room.

Joe is definitely the &#34;trump card&#34; here at Hotel Baker&#39;s lounge.  I hope they keep him, and I may be in next summer when in town for my class reunion."

As much as I had called and checked that YES there is a piano player on Wed night, there was not. And if there was they would have started at 8:30, last dinner order at 9:00, I don&#39;t know about the bar menu. Still pretty pricey and frankly we were still HUNGRY when we got home after Swordfish and 2 lamb &#34;portherhouses&#34;. Wed $5 margaritas had no discernable alcohol, decent but pricey $11 pinot by the glass, a bottle is a better deal if that works for you. I&#39;ve always found the servers to be very good here. Cost us the $15 cash out on the Groupon, plus another $43 over the $50 groupon ($27 alcohol) so plus tip $71 and we were still HUNGRY. 

This is why we have switched to the BeeHive Tavern on Arcada theater nights. Well executed very reasonable bar food. The fish tacos and the separate Talapia plate melt in your mouth. Not always LOUD there, no louder than the late bar at the Rox City grill.
----------

Lunch review, still can&#39;t take it beyond 3 stars like the good old dayze. 
Too expensive, erratic and they don&#39;t let you eat in the back deck on the river anymore. The tables and umbrellas are still there. I want to say what a shame, but I will just say the place was empty.

I can&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t seat outside anymore on a beautiful day. It&#39;s not like they are too busy, it was basically empty when my older brother and I came in for a late lunch at 1:30 midweek. In fact I got in an unnecessarily long conversation with a hostess who insisted they had NEVER seated outside. Yikes.

Our lunch inside was good, served perfectly by Hank. I can recommend the cobb salad which was deliciously unusual with Arugula, pork tenderloin, poached egg, sun dried tomatoes, blue cheese, diced potatoes. Also their own huge chunks of shredded pork sandwich, NOT thankfully buried in bbq sugar sauce. We were not a big fan of the warmed crab salad sandwich but our fault for missing the heated part of the sandwich description. The best way to make crab smell fishier is to heat it, so smother in lemon or better yet avoid it.

I still miss Donna and her newsletters. 
I had a $25 groupon that I paid $15 for $50, so it was a deal and a lot of leftovers. BUT without the groupon still 3 stars.
A-OK, but the Hotel Baker is not taking advantage of several of their many gorgeous resources here, the RIVER and the back deck for lunch. Call first, don&#39;t talk to anybody who says the RCG has NEVER served lunch on the back deck, they are mistaken."

The issue with this is they didn&#39;t tell Groupon that they don&#39;t serve dinner on 2 of the 4 nights the Groupon was good for. When we called they said we could use it on the bar menu.... Because that&#39;s what I bought a Groupon for right? 

Thankfully Groupon agreed that this place didn&#39;t tell the truth to their customers or Groupon and was willing to refund us. Not a good first impression and can&#39;t see any reason to give them a shot now. So instead we went elsewhere and spent our money."

There were 9 of us and i wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. I had been in one other time and had the filet sliders and tortilla soup. Both were very good. 

But back to this more recent visit...we were greeted by the bartender as we walked in and he was a very friendly older man who I found out later is truly an expert at his craft. All the cocktails in our group were (in the words if the ladies) yummy and perfectly mixed. Of course I personally was impressed with the scotch selection. And was happy to see the stocked some fine brands. 

I ordered the filet- perfection with the butter option. My wife and a couple others had the scallops and from the nice brown tops and soft not over cooked center they were phenomenal. My most senior staff person who eats fish all the time said it was the best tasting tilapia she&#39;s ever had. 

If I had one critique it would be that the host staff should have been more engaged in the operation than looking board at the host stand. 

As you can tell I was impressed and in spite of other comments here, the quality was well worth the price charged. And also, quit giving low stars because of your groupon  deal wasn&#39;t working. Man up and have a meal, don&#39;t worry about finding a deal."

Our food was ok, it seemed to be trying too hard.
I had a special, bay scallops in a butter sauce with fillet medallions.
The scallops were amazing the fillet was atrocious. I mean it, atrocious. 
The sauce was Asian inspired and a complete miscue. It seemed to perhaps be applied to cover an aging fillet? But the scallops were great.
My husband had the rib-eye. It was good. 
The donuts were delish, the bread pudding god awful.
This place was schizophrenic. 
Overall, not a bad experience with tip and wine etc. almost $200.

We asked him if they had lobster because that was what we were looking forward to having and he went to check with the chef and came back and said that they did not have any but would get some in just for us.

It was exceptional for them to get it there just for us! Our server Rick was very good, I suggest you ask for him if you ever go!

The dining room is attached to a lounge/bar area in which they&#39;ve got live piano music going on at times, and the folks in there are sometimes blasting out the tunes as they sing along.  If that type of thing bugs you, phone ahead to see if there is live music.  If you like that, phone ahead to see when there will be live music.

It was a really snowy night and parking was a bit of a pain at the downtown parking structure but we made it through.

Service was friendly and attentive.  The restaurant was full enough to feel lively but not too crowded.

My wife wasn&#39;t too hungry so had two appetizers--lobster tacos and the pacific rim salad.  Both were good but a lot of food.

I had a wedge salad which was good but a bit different than wedges I had before and it had a huge amount of dressing.  Fine but not great.  I then had tilapia with a substitute of asparagus on the side.  Both were good but not really special.

I tried it for the first time in February and have been back many times since then for dinner, lunch, ans sometimes just cocktails with appetizers. I have to say this restaurant is very consistently delicious. 

The first time I went, I went with my fiance (the pickiest eater in the world). He is a Midwest guy who loves his met and potatoes and is very critical of steaks. He is also never very impressed with the steaks he orders at a restaurant, always finds something wrong with it. We had an adorable server, Jessica, who was so fun and made great recommendations. Because of her, we ordered the tenderloin sliders for our appetizer. YUM!!! They had a shallot Aoli that was sooooo yummy! Then I ordered the day&#39;s special for my entree: steak with a sauce on top with smashed Yukon potatoes with herbs and feta cheese, and sauteed farm carrots. My portions were huge, and everything was delicious. Feta cheese is smashed potatoes, c&#39;mon, you really can&#39;t go wrong with that. Then I ordered gelato for dessert even though I didn&#39;t have any room left for more food - banana gelato with pralines and carmel.

The food and service was fantastic and even my very picky fiance loved every bite. We have gone back for our anniversary and other date nights. We always try to order something different each time, but we definitely get the sliders as our appetizer.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great date night with amazing food."

I know we had a crab bun thing that melted in our mouth as appetizer, although it was a little to masking the flavor of the crab with cream.

Main dishes were delicious, I am now a huge fan of the gold pan fish or whatever they served me. The kabobs were great, again the flavor was overly dependent on the sauce though.

Oh, noise level, there were some loud groups there, we were thankful we were put in a booth to stop a little bit of the noise. Come on people, they are only across the table from you."

I have had great food and mediocre food.  Last night was meh.   They just debuted their new winter menu and it&#39;s gotten a little pricier.  I ordered a slightly dirty martini with blue cheese olives - perfection.  They do have great martinis here.  My husband and I started off with the shrimp cocktail, which was good.   I ordered the pork tenderloin and it was cooked way too much, it was very dry.  It had good flavor and the reduction sauce helped, but if they had shaved 10 minutes off the cook time, the pork would have been much better.  The whipped potatoes were very spicy.  I like spicy, so it was good for me but if you weren&#39;t into spice, you would have been in for a surprise.  The veggies were good too.  

My husband had the seared ahi tuna with noodles.  They said the ahi was fresh, but it&#39;s didn&#39;t have that deep red look of really great, really fresh ahi tuna.  I keep telling him that there is no way you can get fresh tuna in the midwest.  It has to be frozen and then defrosted.  He keeps trying though.

To make matters worse.. they finally left and their waiter.. was now our waiter.. and he came over and bad mouthed them and gave my wife and I the entire story.. Not a very classy move.

My family also ordered oysters, which I think they liked, but I didn&#39;t eat any. My brother got some sliders he enjoyed and my mom got a burger. My dad got the lobster rolls, which are his perennial favorite. As for me, they don&#39;t really have any vegetarian options, which I think is kind of negligent and alienating for people who don&#39;t eat meat for whatever reason. I ended up ordering the shrimp scampi with the shrimp on the side so my family could eat them. However, this ended up being the most expensive thing we ordered ($27). I don&#39;t want to be forced to pay for something I&#39;m not interested in eating just because they don&#39;t offer a vegetarian option. This place is overpriced in general in my opinion. I personally won&#39;t be back here because there&#39;s not really anything I can eat. For that reason, I reluctantly have to give this place two stars even though I&#39;m sure my family would disagree. Yelp says two stars means &#34;I&#39;ve experienced better,&#34; and I have."

Loved the atmosphere and enjoyed the live piano music that&#39;s featured in the lounge every Thursday.  The bread was warm and delicious.  The lobster bisque was awesome, and the pub chip appetizer was tasty and relatively inexpensive.  My husband and daughter enjoyed their entrees - hubby had swordfish and daughter ordered a filet.  I loved the mashed potatoes that came with their entrees, which I kept sampling because I was very hungry, 

which brings me to the minuses...

We waited really long for the waiter to come to our table to greet us, and to come back to take our order.  The menu was unappealing to me, as I am not a fan of big hunks of meat.  I ordered the skewers, which consisted of 3 small pieces of dry chicken breast; 3 pieces of overcooked filet and 3 small shrimp total, along with some veggies.  They were served with a thick and very sweet sauce which overpowered the scant flavor of the meat and reminded me of something you&#39;d get with a frozen dinner.  The coconut rice side dish was just weird.  At $25 it was a total ripoff.   

I would like to go back to Rox City for appetizers and drinks, especially on a Thursday when they have live piano music.  My husband and daughter probably would like to visit the restaurant again, but I&#39;d take a pass due to the limited and very expensive menu."

Between a $50Groupon offer &amp; possible visit from other worldly spirits (not just the kind from the bartender), I was moderately excited to try this place.  Alas,  It didn&#39;t take long for that excitement to pass. 

My girlfriend, Kelly, &amp; I were quickly seated.  Kelly ordered a martini ($6 Martini Thursdays!) and raved about it, which is consistent with other reviews.  We also were quickly provided with bread, which was ok.  We then ordered the twin lobster rolls for $15.  They were pretty good, especially at that price.   Lots of lobster &amp; bacon,  but I would&#39;ve prefered smaller chunks of celery &amp; a bit more mayo.   For the price, they were the best value of the night.  For dinner, Kelly ordered the scallops and I ordered the 20 oz bone in ribeye.  The scallops were pretty tasty, albeit a bit chewy.  The risotto underneath the scallops was nothing special.  As far as my ribeye, it was smaller than I had expected. Perhaps the bone took up 10+ of the 20 oz.  I hate to say this, but it was one of the worst steaks I&#39;ve ever had, especially given the price.  It appeared to have been hot plated or pan cooked way too long.  It as way too charred,  not salted or seasoned in any way and very fatty/grisly.  While some fat/grisle is to be expected, it was over the top. The charred aftertaste lingered well after the meal was over.  The &#34;crushed&#34; mashed potatoes would have been better had there been salt &amp; butter embedded.  For the amount of money they were charging for the steak &amp; scallops, we&#39;ve had WAY betterone would expect less charring, more seasoning &amp; yes, the occasional dairy condiment. 

Service on the evening was good, not great.  They were short a server so our waiter wasn&#39;t overly available for us.  However, my water glass was always full. 

Overall, we&#39;d go back for the martinis and lobster rolls, but do NOT stick around for dinner.  At those prices, you can get WAY more &amp; better for your money."

Menu is limited so if you have any picky eaters in your group this may pose a problem.

The place is showing it&#39;s age a bit and could use some updating and please get rid of those ridiculously large plates, they are just silly.

If I&#39;m spending $100 (for 2) for dinner there are other places I would much prefer."

From the moment we entered, we were constantly rushed, e.g. &#34;Would you like a cocktail? And are you ready to order now?&#34; Waitress Debra was disinterested, flip, and apparently only interested in getting us out ASAP so she could collect her tip and go home.
As I said, it was the second and last seating, so no one was waiting for a table - tables were opening up and going unfilled.
She was in such a hurry that, when we flagged her over to reorder a wine for one of the party, she flew away, before the rest of us could also reorder. She came back with the wine, I then asked for another, and she flew away again, again without asking anyone else.
When we reviewed the check, we found what we thought was a major mistake, and asked her for an explanation of charges. She acted very put out that we would even question the tab. She couldn&#39;t explain the charges, so we asked for a manager. She then became very curt and walked away.
The hostess then came over, couldn&#39;t explain the extra, inflated charges but said she&#39;d comp us for some of the alcohol tab, which reduced the bill approx. $50 . In retrospect, I think the problem was we were charged for cocktails with well liquor, then recharged for premium liquor. But, who knows? No one there could explain anything on the bill.
Later the General Manager, Mike, came over, and asked us what our problem was. Seemed bored and irked by the whole situation. We told him we&#39;d questioned the bill, no one could explain charges, and no one seemed to really care if it could be explained. Including him.
He talked and mumbled in circles, saying something about the fact that it&#39;s crazy tonight and the waitress was brought in from their banquet staff and didn&#39;t know what she was doing. And why is that my problem, and why was she turned loose on the patrons?
During his whole ramble, no apology for anything. He had an attitude of &#34;it is what it is - what am I supposed to do about it?&#34; He became so irritating that we finally encouraged him to just go away.
We then moved on to the dancing room, which required a ticket for entrance, part of the dinner package. Without the ticket, it was $25, which covered nothing except entrance. Surprise! No one gave us tickets!! We explained no one had given us tickets, at which point Mike the Manager came up from behind and said, very sarcastically, &#34;Just let her in.&#34;
The new owners had transformed the formerly beautiful and elegant Waterfront dining room into a room stripped bare of everything that made it elegant - just a big empty hall. There were only a handful of bistro tables and no chairs, so nowhere to put purses, drinks, etc. A decent DJ was playing, and there was one cash bar. Literally, CASH. Really? I&#39;m going to walk around on New Year&#39;s Eve with a wad of cash?
After about 20 minutes, we left and went to the bar/lounge area, got a table, ordered champagne and after the midnight toast went home.
We expected more from the formerly glorious Baker Hotel. It was not elegant, it was loud, with tables of 12-15 shouting at each other, and not what The Baker was previously (including our daughter&#39;s wedding ten years ago). Or, the New Year&#39;s Eve about ten years which was in the Rainbow Room, elegant, refined and everything you&#39;d expect from a fine dining experience. Rather, the Rox City Grill is a diner/grill, so why try to slap lipstick on it to pass it off as more than it is? Wouldn&#39;t it be better, at least for this occasion, make the Waterfront Room the restaurant for the evening, leave the Rox City as the bar/lounge, and have the dancing in the Rainbow Room ( a glorious dance room with lighted tile floor and a mezzanine, known in it&#39;s heyday as THE place to go for dancing in the western suburbs) Oh, wait - they booked a wedding reception in the Rainbow Room for New Year&#39;s Eve but forgot to tell anyone! Who forgets that they booked a wedding? Genius.
Perhaps the &#34;new&#34; owners should research the history of the establishment and get back to the roots.
At this point in time, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d recommend The Baker to anyone for anything. Hopefully, things will change, but they&#39;d have to work really hard and long to reclaim patrons they&#39;ve put off - one bad experience eliminates second, third fourth etc. chances."

I was a winner during Chicago Magazine&#39;s 40 days of giving. I won an overnight stay at the Baker Hotel in St. Charles and it included dinner and breakfast at the Rox City Grill.  I admit that free food usually taste better but their food was really pretty tasty.  We had sliders for our appetizer since we weren&#39;t planning to order one of their expensive steaks and I loved them.  We both had the wedge salad and while iceberg lettuce is not my favorite I like a wedge salad and theirs was great.  We shared scallops for our entree and while they weren&#39;t the best scallops I&#39;ve ever had they were good.  The lava cake for dessert was decent but could have been a little warmer.  I would definitely go there again for a free meal.

This meal was absolutely on the mark on almost every point. We weren&#39;t interested in any of the appetizers, but went straight for the wedge salads. Lots of thick blue cheese, and bacon over a crispy slice of romaine was really good. DH ordered the filet which was cooked perfectly and fork tender. He was not impressed as much by the spicy mashed potatoes. My butternut squash tortellaci, with duck bacon and cherry compote was amazing. Gelato dessert was average.

Atmosphere was very nice, service was great and the piano player in the adjacent lounge added a nice touch.  Altogether, a great experience.

 We are &#34;Bistro One West&#34; fans looking for a replacement now that BOW has closed. This place is definitely on the menu for future visits."

We were seated right away in what was not the restaurant but rather a room across the lobby from the actually restaurant. They said they were opening a ballroom for dinner as there were large number of people coming but we were the only ones in the room at 7 PM. This should have been our clue to leave. There was only a pre-determined menu with a choice of either soup or salad and chicken or beef. No option to pick from the regular menu?! We knew there wouldn&#39;t be anywhere else to eat that night so we decided to roll with it. Service was quick and friendly (how could it not be if we were the only patrons?) Food was ordered and served within 20 minutes. It was a bland and disappointing meal. Chicken had no flavor and was accompanied by under cooked asparagus and perhaps box mix chunky potatoes. Beef was also under cooked (still cool on one side, lukewarm on the other!) and was sent back. It was also accompanied by the same sorry potatoes and asparagus. A different piece of beef returned after my date had already finished his plate. This piece was at least warm but again, no flavor. Dessert looked beautiful but again no flavor and had some kind of glittery glaze on it that left your mouth literally colored black and a sauce that seemed to be nothing more than orange juice concentrate. We both left hungry and very disappointed. Will not be back."

Here is what went wrong:

*Menu had missing pages so we asked for a replacement.  It also had missing pages
*Waitress forgot water three times 
*Brought the wrong dessert but we couldn&#39;t have eaten it anyways because we didn&#39;t have any utensils
*Brought my husband lemonade instead of water (didn&#39;t she notice it wasn&#39;t clear like the water she poured me?)

When I went up to our room to use the bathroom, my husband said she was mush more attentive, coming around refilling the water and smiling.  Perhaps she just didn&#39;t like me?  

I do have to say though, throughout the entire disaster she was as nice as can be and tried to make it right.  That is the reason why I gave Rox City Grill three stars.  Otherwise it would have been two stars."

1. The atmosphere - we went on a snowy Wednesday, we were sat by the window which was great because we got to look out at the quaint St. Charles town. 
2. The service - most definitely not fine dining however our server Diane was pleasant, witty, quick, service oriented and just a wonderful woman to be around. 
3. The crab cakes and espresso martinis - delish! 

For my entree I had the pork medallions which consisted of two boneless pork chops with a mustard crust, with a blueberry/ cherry sauce, yam mash and three fried yucca chips. My favorite thing about the dish were the fried yucca chips. Everything else was just okay. The pork was over cooked, tough and bland, the yam mash was just gross, it was missing a sweet element and salt. The blueberry/cherry sauce was alright but it did not belong on the plate. 

Overall I would say the one thing missing was consistency and flavor. 

For dessert we had the apple tart, which was not a tart at all, it was a tart shell served with diced apples and caramel sauce on top, no tart or baking about it. 

I&#39;m sorry to say that I wouldn&#39;t dine here again, I would sit at the bar and maybe order an appetizer. This is merely a hotel restaurant, not really a fine dining experience.

You had a choice of either osso bucco or the Menage a Trois which consisted of chateaubriand, lobster stuffed shrimp and a crab cake surrounded by wonderful potatoes and fresh asparagus.  Dinner came with a soup with duck confit or salad.  The dessert was perfect for the celebration.  A 3 layer cake with whipped cream along with other sweets.  Their martini&#39;s were right on! 

Highlight of the evening was one of the guests had 4 singers, dressed in white tuxedos, sing &#34;let me call you sweetheart&#34; to his wife of 30 years.  Everyone thought that was so beautiful.  What a wonderful gesture to someone whom you&#39;ve loved for many years and still the love light was in his eyes!  All in all,  Rox is a nice restaurant, great bar, and if you get a table near the window, a nice way to view passers-by.  Will  be back again even though we live in downtown Chicago.

I had the pork chop, which was large, flavorful, done just right and accompanied by a strange tasting mushroom and cheese patty.

And I feel it&#39;s not worth it I can get the same food for a third of the price in Chicago!!!!!  It was 29$ for my fiancé myself and 17 mo to eat a couple of hot dogs and fried. 
It just I hate to say it but I felt ripped off. I really did. The drinks are expensive and I kid you not with the amount and type of ice they use your lucky if you even get 10oz of soda. I didn&#39;t even think to ask for no ice. And they don&#39;t have refills..... I felt like I was eating in an amusement park restuarant. Because of how expensive it is and how ripped off I felt. Seriously I could buy 5 hot dogs, fully dressed all beef, fries, 3 drinks for 15 bucks of the same size and better quality..... 

I give it 2 stars because I&#39;m still recovering from the financial crisis it was to feed my family some hot dogs,fries and sodas"

Whenever I used to visit the Portillo&#39;s / Baranelli&#39;s combo, I always went to Baranelli&#39;s because they had no line, and Portillo&#39;s had a line 30 people deep! Looking back that should have been a serious red flag and a reality check that I was missing out on something amazing. Of course, time constraints always got the best of me, and Baranelli&#39;s short line won me over. 

Well, on my most recent visit to Portillo&#39;s, I finally branched out and stood in the long line on the other side of the building. Gasp! Well, the long Portillo&#39;s wait was certainly worth it. 

I indulged in a Chicago-style hot dog (which was truly Chicago-style, neon green relish and sports peppers galore!), spicy and sweet Italian beef sandwiches (I prefer the spicy), cheese fries, chopped salad (from Baranelli&#39;s) and the chocolate cake. All were simply heavenly. 

Their only downfall is their insane prices. Wow. Be prepared for an expensive bill-- when I first ordered the Italian beef and was asked to pay over $10, my eyes bugged out a little. But I suppose indulging once in awhile won&#39;t be too hard on the wallet!

If you&#39;re visiting Chicagoland and want to experience what Chicago food is, then go to Portillo&#39;s, it will feed your craving."

We came in ordered food. Only part of our visit to go well... 
So we made are way down to wait ...

10 mins goes by , I said ok they are busy any minute .....
Wait wait wait hear couple numbers higher then ours so I asked the kid working counter hey seen our order? 
He looked at order said hold on...
He rattles off another 2 orders 
I then asked where&#39;s ours , he walked away to old man manager and then came back said we haven&#39;t made it and forgot your order , he went back towards manager , manager just came over and sorry a$$ smile on his face waved and turned his back and walked away from me as I said  hey I wanna talk to you .he kept walking away . I sent kid after him to bring his sorry xxx back over  and he just looked at me . Told him what are you going to do , over 30 mins no food, no apologies, nothing just a smirk, told him of his poor management and response to service ... Didn&#39;t do anything , hands me shake I said no thanks , refund ... He brought money and walked away...

After awhile it can get a little old but most folk like to go back. 

Generally service is good and they usually make good on things when it is not.  They try and keep it clean. 

If you want a Chicago dog and are in town, this is a safe place to try.  You will most likely come back.

Smart staff .. like the old school one liners from the pickup crew &#34;order numbr 8 no more wait&#34; etcetera.. good food, cool atmosphere, fun place to bring friends to shoot the crap and kid friendly"

No, really, I am POSITIVE that it does.

The Portillo&#39;s side of the restaurant has all sorts of classics, such as hot dogs, burgers, Italian beef, the usual suspects in Chicago hot dog stands. If this does not appeal to your palate, then you may looks at the Barnelli&#39;s side, which you can get anything from a salad, ribs, pasta, pizza, anything! If you can&#39;t pick from any menu, I really cannot understand how you live day to day.

The taste is amazing. The price could be better, but I still find myself going here time after time for the quality and the atmosphere. It&#39;s a Chicago classic and a must-see for out-of-town guests (and I mean that for those who do not live in Chicago or the suburbs)."

It was Black Friday at 1 PM.  I&#39;m not sure if everyone that had been shopping for the day decided they needed Portillo&#39;s or if it&#39;s always this busy for lunch, but this place was slammed!  Once we found a table in this jungle, I was surprised at how quickly both the line and food were processed.  Prices are ok as welll.  I got the beef with sweet and hot giardiniera, fries and a drink.  Fries were decent, nothing spectacular, not soggy disgusting-ness.  The beef was...sorry, but mine was just ok.  The bread was great...this is what a beef should be served on.  The beef itself was...dare I say, bland?  Sorry folks, but consider me unimpressed.

Kind of like their napkins or a brown paper bag. I took it back for a refund but was talked into getting a new beef. Half was through I noticed a black spot on the paper the beef was wrapped in.

This place makes my mouth water. When I left Chicago many years ago, other than deep dish pizza, this place made me miss Chi-Town so much. Something about this place, they know how to make Italian Beef sandwiches. Yes, they are the very BEST!! No one compares. 

Italian Beef dipped, of course with Mozzarella cheese and hot peppers, oh my it gives you a huge foodgasm!!! Greasy, excellent fresh bread, awesome juice, thinly sliced beef to perfection. Fries are crinkled cut and always fresh and hot. Then another must is their tamale....oh so good, a bit spicy and delish. 

Now the hot dog&#39;s do not do it for me. I still prefer &#34;Jimmy&#39;s hot dog&#39;s in the city. All of their locations are clean, great service, fast with plenty room to dine in. The drive-thru&#39;s are quick and professional. This place is fast food at it&#39;s best. 

Seriously glad we do not have one here in Miami because I would weigh 300 pounds. I could never get tired of eating here. 

Disclaimer: Be prepared, you will use a million paper napkins and feel like a grease pit after eating one. But oh so worth it..... 
I love you Portillo&#39;s!"

A Portillo&#39;s hot dog with small fries and a drink costs like $7.50, and you don&#39;t get refills on the drink.  Lots of kids in dining room.  

I didn&#39;t see any mention of Barnelli&#39;s Pasta Bowl in the reviews I skimmed - it is adjoining this location.  You get a good &#34;value&#34; if you get the homemade minestrone soup that is served with a half loaf of fresh bread, or the kids spaghetti/meatball (not plural on the meatball, lol).  .  Also, you cannot order Barnelli&#39;s items at the drive thru.

I&#39;m rating this a 4 star because of the food quality, however I feel its really a 3 star for me because its expensive for fast food hot dogs and because I have to park to get Barnelli&#39;s."

Good food...maybe alittle pricey.  Good stuff...but nothing super duper about it.

Staff was friendly, place was clean, and the knick knacks within are cool.  Parking was in a shared mall....it is kinda in a weird cul de sac location...and follow the same way you came in cause the other way leads to a dark place (which for me was 10:30 at night t a dark dead end.)

Even the servers start to remember what you&#39;re drinking if you come around enough, and they are very friendly here.  The atmosphere is pretty chill, there are a bunch of TVs around in the dining area as well as the bar, so you can get your game watching/cheering on!  It can get pretty packed on game days/nights, but the wait is never really all that long.  They are hella high tech here with being able to text your phone directly when your table is ready, so in the meantime, you can grab a drink from the bar and start out with some liquid appetizers.  It tastes soooo good once it touches your lips.

Now let&#39;s get to the food action right here.  Many people go to the Village Tavern for their Chicken fingers.  These are pretty good actually... Their chicken fingers are deep fried in some proper batter.  I prefer these to be a little crunchy over softer ones, but this will fill you up for sure, and you&#39;ll probably need a box if you get it as a meal, because they are really filling.  You&#39;ll feel like a turkey on Thanksgiving after chowing down on these chicken fingers and french fries.  I don&#39;t often order these, but if you are suffering from a massive hangover, these bad boys might do the trick.

Now, where they really shine is on their burger game.  These are definitely on point!  I think at least half of the time I&#39;ve went to the Village Tavern, I ordered the Onion Bacon Cheese Burger.  Now this is a big juicy burger with a nice amount of cheese and they go wild with the bacon.  Big thick pieces piled up on top to go with the grilled onions...just toss on a little ketchup, and you will go into burger bliss. 

 Their fries are nicely seasoned and also have a nice crisp to it.  A lot of burger places have great burgers, but when it comes to their fries, it turns out to be absolute weak sauce.  Here at the VTG, the burgers and fries are top notch.  I usually order, a side Caesar Salad as well.  Even that is done up properly time after time.  It&#39;s pretty affordable too.  It goes great with a cold brew to say the least!

I&#39;ve never had the Nachorama, but that would be the next thing I&#39;d wanna try.  It looks like a mountain of nachos, if you order this be sure to bring a big crew in order to erode that massive pile down to a valley.  There&#39;s various sandwiches and other dinners as well.  I&#39;ve never had a bad meal here yet.  My buddy and I have came here a bunch after work, and it usually turns to be out on the cheaper side tab compared to other surrounding restaurants in the Schaumburg area..   Good food and good service at affordable prices goes a long way."

Kind of quaint if you squint. It seems they never updated since they were established. It&#39;s all good, this place gets packed and they seem like a bunch of locals here. I dig it. 

So I give 4 stars for location (close to my crib), very affordable menu (they have like 10,000 items in their menu), fast and friendly service (although be careful, she gave a couple of suggestions that were totally off), and their batter (they fry everything here and they mastered the art of the batter--- so get everything in the menu that&#39;s deep fried)

Chips con queso: the chips are too hard for my liking and the queso dip was too runny and lacks taste. 

Chicken tortilla soup: sooooo good! Meaty, crunchy (tortilla chips), chunky, fresh taste, and has a sweet aftertaste because of the delicious veggies in it. 

Chicken tenders: wowwww MUST HAVE. The batter makes these tenders tasty, tender, and perfect crunch. Get the original. Although I liked the buffalo, I love the original with the honey mustard. 

Chili soup: it&#39;s ok. It&#39;s not as big of a deal like the server described it. They really pimp their chili though. It comes with green onions, onions, cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips, and of course the chili! 

Chicken parmigiana: I don&#39;t know why I ordered this... but I did so here it is: huge tasty chicken breast on top of fettuccine pasta, this needed more pasta sauce and that may have done the trick. But then again, why did I order this??? Unless you&#39;re feigning for a huge chunk of chicken breast with mozzarella and sauce on top, skip this. They have tons of items in their menu to choose from.  

Dessert: so to wrap up our heart attack dinner we ordered the deep fried sampler platter: deep fried Oreo, deep fried cheesecake, deep fried twinkies, and deep fried snickers topped with two scoops of ice cream and whipped cream. Also followed by an ER visit to get an EKG and a nitro."

I&#39;ll be returning because I have family members who swear by it but it&#39;s not my favorite.

After all, it says so on their shirt! ;)

Growing up and going to high school in Schaumburg, everyone knows about the Village Tavern. It&#39;s a staple in the neighborhood. 
I used to visit VTG numerous times a month in my high-school days. I&#39;ve never left hungry and always left happy.

After a few years without visiting, (I moved to Arlington Heights) my friend decided to make tonight a throwback moment. We decided to make the somewhat far drive to check out an old favorite.

We went in around 6:30 and the place was PACKED! This is a normal be used everyone loves it. We put our name in the list and they put us in the app. The app allows you to see from your iPhone your estimated wait and how many parties are ahead of you. Great feature, very much appreciated.

After about ten minutes, we were seated and ordered an ice cold Blue Moon. Keep in mind, Schaumburg police/village require TWO FORMS OF I.D. to purchase and consume. I showed a insurance card and my drivers license with no problem. 

We enjoyed our beer while scanning thru the huge menu. There is something for everyone here. I decided to start with the baked French onion soup. We also each ordered the chicken finger appetizer. 

The soup was served piping hot with a heap of ooey-gooey cheese on top. Perfect, just how I like it. The soup was incredible with plenty of onions. 

Next, on to the world famous chicken fingers. They&#39;re world famous for a reason, nobody makes em&#39; like VTG. Crispy and light breading over juicy and tender chicken inside. They serve it with a super secret honey mustard sauce for dipping. The honey mustard MAKES AND ENHANCES the chicken tenders. No ketchup or ranch, stick to the honey mustard! They melt in your mouth and are best eaten piping hot where you are sure to scar the roof of your mouth. ;) 

The service here is superb. Even when swamped, they provide an excellent dining experience. The noise is a bit loud inside, but it&#39;s a causal, fun neighborhood spot. The owner knows what he&#39;s doing and doesn&#39;t need to change a thing! 

So go ahead, throw your pajama bottoms on and kick back with an ice cold beer and a basket of the best chicken fingers known to man!"

But don&#39;t get stuck on those two items.  other things that I&#39;ve had that are awesome are the lasagna (ask for no red sauce unless you like sweet sauce), pork chops, nachos, Mexican pizza, roast beef or beef stew - I can&#39;t remember.  I just know it was all good.  If you are a drinker, they have plenty to choose from.  I always have a good experience with the staff as well.

Went thru Yelp to find good restaurants around that area, and I found this place. He loves American food and beers. This is the perfect place for that!

I ordered chicken fingers since the restaurant is well known for those. Boy, it was hellaaaaa good! So unhealthily crunchy! Haha! Even though I&#39;m on healthy diet, I literally finished my food in less than 10 minutes. You gotta try this dish when you swing by here.  My cousin got a burger and blue moon beer. He said his burger was juicy and fulfilled his craving. 

The service was quick too! The waitress (sorry i didn&#39;t catch her name) was too sweet to let us know that the restaurant is not going to serve the food after 11 pm (we arrived at 10:58 pm), and she happily took our orders with no attitude nor rudeness.

Yet, chicken fingers will be the only thing I will order at Village Tavern. Ever. And I mean it. 

Yesterday was my second visit to Village Tavern. My first visit was two years ago and their chicken fingers have been in my mind ever since. They are so crispy, tender and so juicy! They&#39;re also beer battered and don&#39;t taste like you&#39;re swallowing tablespoons of oil. Aaaaand they come with their homemade honey mustard that is perfect! 

My friend ordered the chicken burrito, I ordered the chicken finger plate and we had fried mushrooms to share. 

Food came out so quickly! My friend really enjoyed her burrito. I was in loooooove with my chicken finger plate! For about $10, you get a choice of a soup or salad (I chose the Chicken Rotini), vegetables upon request (steamed carrots and broccoli--perfectly seasoned and so fresh!), and a form of carb (fries, mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin, or Spanish rice). 

The fried mushrooms ($6) were amazing as well! I never know whether the fried mushrooms I order elsewhere are fresh or frozen...but Village Tavern&#39;s are FOR SURE fresh. They use the same batter as their chicken fingers and they are perfectly seasoned, fresh, crispy, and amazing. I really hate paying money for an appetizer that I barely share with other people at my table. For $6, you can share for sure because they give you huge fried mushrooms and there are plenty to go around. 

My visit last night was superb thanks to our waitress, Caitlin. She was so attentive to our needs. Caitlin noticed that my friend and I were famished. She was so sweet and she put in our order to be rushed and made immediately. What a gem! She was always happy and filled our water/came to check on us at the most opportune times. I most definitely recommend her!

Ordered to go the other day and was left craving more. Their chicken fingers were still good and tasty but extra greasy, not like how it used to be. The wings were completely overcooked and dry, but SUPER spicy. The cucumber bruschetta was tasty but the bread that was served with it was burnt... 

The worst part was the Caesar salad, like how do you mess up a Caesar salad? It was bitter and the dressing was watery. The Parmesan and croutons were soggy and sad. Just disappointing and a waste of money.

We went here on a Monday, it was very crowded, and pretty loud for a weeknight.  I got a philly cheese beef sandwich, and shared an order of chicken fingers with my date.  The sandwich and side of fries was good, but as you might of guessed, the chicken fingers stole the show.  Very tender and deliciously breaded!  We ordered bbq and honey mustard sauce on the side, and they went great with both.  Seriously, if you go here and don&#39;t get the chicken fingers you are messing up big time.

They have a nice selection of beers and cocktails.  The food is also great and when I was on a diet, their low-cal options weren&#39;t that bad as well.  Most people come here for the chicken fingers which are outstanding.  The batter on the chicken fingers is what makes it taste great.

I couldn&#39;t believe it, but my doubting mind was quickly put to ease because the strips really are all that.

Now that we live closer, we came back last week before hitting up the mall. It was a Friday night and they were pretty busy, but we were able to sneak past everyone waiting for a table to steal the last 2 stools at the bar.  I wanted to see if the chicken strips were still good, so we ordered the signature strips with honey mustard, along with potato skins. I also ordered a Bomb Pop drink. The drink was cheap and strong, which is always a good thing. It looked just like a bomb pop too so the nostalgia of my childhood was in full force.

There were quite a few people coming in for carry-out orders and I found my purse, chair and elbows getting bumped quite a bit. It was all worth it though. When the food came out a few minutes later, it was piping hot. I loved the skins. They were incredibly cheesy and loaded with green onions. A full order was enough to bring half of them home for the next day.  The chicken fingers are still every bit as good as I remember. The batter is so thick and substantial. It&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d find at a fish fry--just on chicken instead of fish. The honey mustard is so good and will convert even non-mustard lovers. I actually took the tiny bit of mustard we had left home with me. 

Our bill was insanely reasonable too. For two appetizers and two drinks, we walked out spending $32. We later went to another bar and spent $26 on two drinks alone. 

Two different bartenders helped us out and they were both attentive and friendly with us and the other customers at the bar. I didn&#39;t get a chance to try the nachos, but they looked loaded, so I&#39;ll be coming back soon."

It was totally packed by the time we got there. I think they were saying the wait was 30 minutes for 2 people when we got there- which I wasn&#39;t expecting for a pub in the suburbs. Our group was 45 minutes late... but luckily the place was nice and seated the two of us immediately so we at least got to sit down for 45 minutes (although we felt very bad for taking up such a big table). But the server was nice and didn&#39;t say anything about it. The place was really big and had a ton of tables and seating. It was hard to find close parking.

I got the Parmesan Shoe Strings Cheese Burger with bleu cheese and on Rye Bread. To be honest, it was just O.K. It&#39;s not something I would get again. The fries were also just O.K. But for $8 it was not bad.

My hubby got the Onion Bacon Cheese Burger. He said it was okay. He did like his sweet potato fries though! They looked much more fresh than the regular fries. He also got a lil sumpin sumpin =).

Our friends shared appetizers like the spinach dip, french onion and brocolli cheddar soup, chicken tenders, and sampler platter with mozarella sticks, quesadillas, etc. I think they liked their meals."

The full order must be huge!
I also suggest you get the chicken fingers platter. They are so good! Especially with the honey mustard sauce. They were both tender, juicy and crispy all at once. And if you get the loaded cheese fries with it you get more cheese then fries!
I finished off my meal with the fried cheesecake egg rolls. Which these were to die for. The mix of cinnamon, vanilla ice cream and cheesecake wrapped in a flaky crust was so yummy. 
And to top it all off my bill wasn&#39;t that bad. For the amount and quality of the food you get this place was so worth it! Go here! You won&#39;t regret it!"

Got there about 8pm (Friday) and it was busy. We just sat at the bar. We were immediately greeted and given menus.

Now after all the reviews, I already knew what I wanted. I needed a little bit of everything. Cheeseburger, Nachos and Chicken Fingers with their honey mustard sauce. You better believe we ordered all of that and split it.

Okay.. Let&#39;s start with the cheeseburger. WOW! They seasoned this to perfection. The taste was honestly unbelievable. I&#39;d easily gain 50lbs if I lived by here. They came with a side of fries. Usually bars have just regular fries and there&#39;s nothing special, however, these were awesome! Again, seasoned to perfection.. My mouth is watering while I&#39;m typing this; I may have a problem! lol

Nachos - Fully loaded. We only ordered a half order and that was enough for two people and to take some home, which I did ;) and ate them later! Then the lady asked, &#39;don&#39;t you want to try the chicken fingers with our homemade honey mustard&#39;.. Uhh yaa!! (40 lbs later) They were awesome and the honey mustard was excellent! The reviews aren&#39;t lying about this place.

We also orders the fish fry Platter with fries and hush puppies. It was HUGE. Had plenty to take home, but other places make it more delicious. The other meal ordered was the fried buffalo chicken sandwich, also huge. 

The drinks however were good. I ordered the Snow Cone cocktail and the dreamsicle.. both good, but the Snow Cone was better. If you&#39;re looking for a chill place to have a drink I would recommend this place.. if you looking to have dinner, there are plenty of restaurants out there!"

I stopped in today right at open (11a), I was across the street getting my car detailed at Action Audio and Detail. Saw they were right there so I decided to spend my 2 hours here. BEST. DECISION. EVER. *** for today.

I was greeted and seated immediately when I came in. Awesome. The feel of this place is very home-y and comfortable, you feel very much part of a family when you walk in just because of the way the employees carry themselves. 

My server Lexi came over smiling and asked if she could help me out, I asked for coffee which was delivered immediately. Nice and hot. 

She helped me since it was my first time here with her menu knowledge making suggestions they were known for, but also making suggestions that weren&#39;t advertised all over the place. I ended up picking something I knew I would like but was also special to the house because it had the chicken fingers in it.

DELICIOUS! I loved my food. I didn&#39;t eat it all because the portions are abundant and I never finish a meal anyways; I brought it home for my hubby. I paid 13.03 for a big-ass wrap, and loaded cheese fries with bottomless coffee. I feel like my money went very very far today. 

I have never seen a pub/tavern fill for a Monday lunch, but let me tell you by the time noon rolled around this place was 80% full, even the bar. I bet you need to make reservations for the weekend or be prepared to wait a decent amount of time, but they also have a connection with No Wait which can help you with that. 

I have been in the food service industry for 13 years, I have done it all from serving, cooking, hosting, banquets and I have been managing now for the last 4 years. This place makes me want to come work for them, I truly enjoyed it this much. 

Lexi, you were awesome, friendly, attentive, and I couldn&#39;t have asked for better service. I haven&#39;t found service this good in a long long time (and the strange thing is I feel like I wasn&#39;t treated special, my server did not go above and beyond for me, but it appeared that she wanted to be at work, and that she WANTED to serve me and THAT makes all the difference in the world)

Thanks for the great lunch, though you are way out of my way, when I come back out to Schaumburg, you&#39;ll be the place I come to."

Don&#39;t let the exterior of Village Tavern deter you from stopping in for some good comfort food.  I came with my girlfriend for a late lunch on a Monday afternoon and we were pleasantly surprised.  Village Tavern seems like a cozy, neighborhood bar that would be packed with regulars on a daily basis.  It has an old school charm to it which I loved.  The food is priced well, tastes great, and portions are huge.  

I had the pot roast which comes with a soup or salad (I chose the beef tortilla soup) and sides of veggies and garlic mashed potatoes.  After I had the soup I was already halfway full since the portion was that hefty!  My entree itself could have fed two people and I was able to only eat about a third of it.  The mashed potatoes were garlicy and delicious, pot roast was tender and flavorful, and the veggies were probably from a frozen bag.  My friend ordered the chicken burrito and the description of the burrito did not lie.  They called it ginormous and that it was.  She was only able to eat half of it and was super stuffed afterwards.

We definitely want to come back and check it out for happy hour with friends (mainly so we can try out more food on the menu since there were a TON of yummy sounding things).  Until then Village Tavern!"

Taste was okay.   Sort of bland.  Nachos were soggy and we were there when they were brought out from the kitchen.   The nachos while piled high with stuff but just lacked flavor.  They were skimpy with the cheese and sour cream.  

The Chicken Burrito Grande was good.  It tasted fresh.  I had to add Tobasco Sauce to jazz up the flavor.

The pulled pork&#39;s barbeque sauce was so so but I like Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s the best and my own second.  The pulled pork sandwich was average, nothing special.

Service was good.  People were friendly and efficient.

Food here tends to be priced high compared to the value and taste.  

They do have ordering on line which is nice.

VTG earns a solid rating based largely on the strength of its chicken fingers and generally good service.  (And in full disclosure, I&#39;ve only gotten the chicken fingers here.)  The chicken fingers are covered with a light yet crispy batter that does not overwhelm the chicken meat.  The pieces are pretty big so you&#39;ll definitely get your fill.  Plus, VTG does not mess around with that honey mustard; it&#39;s the perfect dipping sauce for that chicken!

I&#39;ve eaten inside and taken out from VTG, and the service has been good each time. The atmosphere inside is typical of the bar and grill restaurant, and the prices are reasonable."

Love the food, hate the service. My last visit was last week later in the evening, around 8pm. I thought it would be a good idea to go later, so it would be less jam packed, and it was. The food was great as usual, and my two friends I brought with had never been and really enjoyed their meals. What was lacking was service from our server. She was nice, but it was really obvious she was exhausted, which she confirmed when she screwed something up and told us she had been there since 1030 this morning. Glasses often sat empty and it took a long time for our food to come, even though the place wasn&#39;t packed. Maybe they had a lot of to go orders? Either way, to go will more than likely be my only way I continue to enjoy food from there."

So I was in the area today and decided to stop in.  From the name I was expecting a nice and quiet place to eat and have a drink.  First in you are expecting a quiet place, keep driving.  If you want some great food, stop in.

Pulling into the parking lot, I thought we would have a long wait to get a seat, it was packed with cars.  Walked in and got seated right away.  Are server Lexi was there right away and took our orders. And through out the meal she kept tabs on our table and get the glasses full.  We ordered the chicken platters which came with a salad and potatoes.  There was enough food to feed two people from one platter.  The chicken fingers are fairly large and plentiful which included the dipping sauce.  The fingers were hot and nicely breaded.  This place has big screen tv&#39;s all over playing different things.

The negatives.  This place is loud, I forgot how loud bars can be, so if you plan on talking during your visit you must raise up your voice a few notches.  When I went to grab the chair to pull it closer to the table, it was full of some sticky substance which had to be washed off of my hands.  The salad that came with the platter was loaded with dressing, it would of have been better if was served in a little cup or dish."

We are from Wisconsin.  When we walked in, we were immediately seated by a wonderful hostess/ waitress. We sat down and got our menu&#39;s and drinks faster than fast.  I ordered the fish fry, my wife ordered the famous chicken strips. Coming from Wisconsin where there&#39;s a fish fry in every restaurant every Friday, I was anxious to see what Chicago had to offer. To my surprise it was the best all-you-can-eat fish fry I have ever had. The fish was flaky and tender while the batter was a golden brown.  It was, I have to say, the perfect fish. My wife had the chicken tenders. She said they really lived up to the reputation of being the house specialty. The portion sizes was unreal. So much food. The side that came with our meals were also above our expectations . Augratin potatos? Not many restaurants serve this as a side option. We eat out a lot and I remember those places that treated me well and had great food. And believe me, I will remember this for a long time...... the Big Bopper out."

I feel like I&#39;m allowed the townie comment since I grew up in Schaumburg. And they flock to Village Tavern like a moth to a flame. And that&#39;s a good thing. VT is pretty sweet overall with its extensive menu (both food and bar), plenty of space and tons of TVs (if that&#39;s what you seek). 

It&#39;s a place you can certainly bring your kiddos for lunch or an early dinner as there&#39;s plenty of fare for the little ones. And while tons of people love love love their chicken fingers, I have to say they aren&#39;t my favorite thing on the menu. Yes, the are thickly breaded, fat, juicy fingers served with a practically drinkable-it&#39;s-so-good honey mustard sauce. Instead, though, I&#39;m talking about the club sandwich. Piled high with plenty o&#39;meat and fillings, this sandwich is big enough for two meals and comes with a trough sized portion of fries (get the sweet potato variety if you steer that way). 

VT has certainly grown with the times - offering up things like texting you with updates if you&#39;re waiting for a table, diversifying its beer list and generally maintaining the good food and service folks in Schaumburg have come to expect. Two thumbs up for this local staple."

First, they do pub food perfectly.The chicken fingers are world famous-or so it says on the wall, the menu, and the t-shirts they sell. They may not be world famous, but they should be. if you only have one item here order the chicken fingers. The burgers are also good,as are the fish and chips and the nachos are superior. The daily specials pretty much rock as well. The second awesomeness is this is the best place to watch chicago sports. Both the staff at the bar and the other locals are very, shall we say enthusiastically interactive.  If you do not want zestful enthusiasm on game day, avoid the bar. You can still enjoy the game from a booth. This is a family neighborhood  type pub so children of all ages will be present, except at the bar area, which is where you should be if you are serious about drinking.  
Be advised that during peak times-such as friday/saturday nights around dinnertime, this place is super busy. Parking is plentiful but since the parking lot is shared with other businesses parking can be a little tricky. there can be a wait to be seated as well, and the table service especially as regards drinks can be slower then you might like. Outside of the dinner/lunch  rush hours these conditions do not apply. So there&#39;ll be plenty of room when the game starts at 7:00 pm or so.
In summary this is a perfect place to watch sports, or bring the family for a casual dinner or lunch. I&#39;m totally planning to come back."

There, I said it.

And now with a cleansed soul, and a renewed vision, I&#39;m able to focus a little clearer, staying a tad sharper while wading through numerous options found in bar menus.

I&#39;m on a mission. A mission, to find that ultimate hot dog and chicken finger joint.

First stop...right here in the suburbs of Chicago, home of the &#34;World Famous&#34; Chicken Fingers. 

We came here because Chicago was having a trifecta of sporting events, The Blackhawks and The Bulls were still in the playoffs and the Cubs were playing the Rockies, all on the same night. It just so happens we stroll into a local tavern boasting about the Chicken Fingers.

As promised, I scanned the menu, for only two options- Chicken Fingers and a Hot Dog.

Now, when the menu, your cute server, the napkins, the T-shirts, the plane pulling a banner, the local crowd, all brag about these incredible Fingers...you order tem. Did I mention the cute server?

Done.

Now, is there a hot dog to sample? Perhaps a fine Chicago Dog, with that crazy fluorescent green relish. Let&#39;s see...Cuban sandwich, Italian Grinder, what a cute server, focus Rick, a Reuben, Philly Chees... whoa! What the hell?

A Fenway Dog, in the heart of Chicago? What would Abe Froman (Ferris Bueller reference) the sausage king of Chicago think about this...right in his own back yard?

Yes, I have to have it. It must be good. 

Perhaps I gather a second opinion. 

Yep, verified by cute server number 1, well sort of, (turns out, she&#39;s a vegetarian), but she brings over cute server number 2.

&#34;What do you think, only a great dog from Boston, would survive this long in a Chicago Sports Bar. Don&#39;t be a knucklehead, get It.&#34;  - Cute Server Number 2

First, the Chicken Fingers are incredible. I mean magical. I can&#39;t describe how delicious they are, the outside golden flakey batter melts in your mouth, the moist and flavorful skin creates this pocket of perfection, like a breezeway locking in the juices and not allowing the humidity or steam to escape, making the white tender chicken breast inside more moist than The Golden Girls on a double dose of estrogen and progesterone therapy. It&#39;s Colonel Sanders meets H. Salt Esquire Fish-n-Chips. A must!

Next up, the Fenway dog. It&#39;s big. A 1/4 pound dog wrapped in a New England Roll, topped with mustard, relish and onions. I say wrapped, because the steam makes the roll encase the hot dog, forming perfectly to your own hand. The snap of the dog is crisp, I love the fact there is no ketchup in sight and the onions add, not detract, from the beefy flavor. The roll is the same as they use in making New England Lobster rolls, with high sides (to keep the dog corralled) and oozing with egg and butter flavors. It&#39;s soft and tender and at first glance, looks like they cheated you with a heel of Wonder Bread. 

Seriously, if you are in Schaumburg, Chicago you have to find this place...if not for the great food, sports, or incredible service...Do it for the cute servers."

Not a food review. Just stopped with a friend for a beer at the bar after work. Typical local pub type place. Didn&#39;t get food but looked like decent super unhealthy type bar food. Think huge portions nachos, chicken fingers, and french fries. Restaurant full of families and kids sports teams. Place is worn, loud, and dark inside. About what you would expect. Very popular with the locals so you are better off doing carry out for food Fri/Sat night. Bar is full of regulars. After work bros and a lot of old men who look like they never leave. A real sausage fest. Bartenders basically ignore you if not a regular and begrudgingly serve you eventually. It is what it is. If your expectations are set correctly going in, it is just ok. If not, you might be disappointed."

In fact, the chicken fingers apparently put Village Tavern on the map. The restaurant was featured on a program called &#34;Chicago&#39;s Best&#34; because of them. On a recent Monday afternoon, I decided to investigate the hype. 

My meal began with a half order of the famed Nachorama. As you can see in the photographs, loads of cheese, black olives, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, and beans are piled high on the chips. After ordering nachos in other restaurants, I can tell you no other nachos have measured up to Village Tavern&#39;s. The Nachorama contains all the ingredients you want covering your chips, in abundance. The cheese was thick, gooey, and held everything in place. The chips were tucked throughout the dish. 

After consuming the nacho bomb, I was somewhat full. However, I still had to try the chicken finger platter. The platter consists of six huge, tender, chicken pieces in a crispy batter. Hands down these were the best chicken fingers I have ever had. The batter was non-greasy and the chicken pieces were high quality. What added to this amazing dish was the honey mustard dipping sauce. Both the honey and mustard flavors came through strongly. 

In addition to excellent food, I must commend the attentive waitstaff. The waitresses paced our meal perfectly. As soon as we finished the nachos, the entrees came right out--not a moment too soon. At the end of our meal, everyone needed boxes to bring home leftovers. The waitresses promptly brought out boxes and a large bag for us to take our food home. They even brought me an extra cup of that outstanding honey mustard dipping sauce. The waitstaff was pleasant and responded well to our table, without hovering. I assume they must have good management here. 

Visit Village Tavern on an empty stomach so you can fill up on the amazing grub. This is a great neighborhood place."

It&#39;s been around a long time and it was filled with couples, small groups, families with young children and families with several generations.  Because of how packed it was the service wasn&#39;t attentive, but the food came out fast.  It was also pretty noisy in there...but with &#34;tavern&#34; in the name I wouldn&#39;t expect less.

They have an all-you-can-eat fish fry on Fridays.  We had the chicken strip dinner which was an amazing deal - it came with a crock of soup (even French Onion!), 6 HUGE freshly beer-battered chicken strips, a big cup of honey mustard &amp; a mound of French Fries (you have your choice of potato).  It was enough to feed 3 people!  The fries were perfectly cooked and the chicken strips were the best I&#39;ve ever had.  Two of our friends always order the nachos here to share and OH MY GOODNESS - it was a platter ridiculously MOUNDED with nachos.  It was enough to feed 10 people as a snack or 5 as a meal, in my opinion - so consider yourself warned.

I&#39;m not a smoker &amp; don&#39;t endorse smoking, but if you are an e-cig user be aware...the manager came over and asked our friend who was using her e-cig to please stop using it.  I know businesses have the right to decide if they can be used inside or not and this place has chosen to NOT allow them.  The manager told me it&#39;s because they don&#39;t want it to appear someone is actually smoking &amp; also because a lot of families come there, who don&#39;t appreciate it. Duly noted."

It may be known for the chicken fingers but the great homemade daily specials and staff is what makes this place shine! They&#39;re celebrating their 20th anniversary this year too!

I first learned of VTG when I lived in Carol Stream some 14 years ago. I had never been to this location before seeing them featured on Chicago&#39;s Best TV and then attending a fund raiser for Autism Speaks, here in Schaumburg. That was all it took for me to make the journey here time and time again. The chicken finger salad was my first meal here, loved it. I finished it with the fried cheesecake egg roll desert and have tried the daily specials the rest of my visits. 

My latest experience was this past Mandy-tory Monday, for the filming of Nachorama. (for a feature on WGN morning news, by Marcus Leshock for National Nacho Day) I had the chicken pot pie and black bean soup for lunch. Now the soup would have made a great meal all on it&#39;s own, then you top it off with the best pot pie you&#39;ve ever had. The huge chunks of white meat, the fresh potatoes and vegetable and  then a cracker thin flaky crust, set this dish apart from the rest. I took Mandy, the bartender&#39;s advise and splashed a little Cholula on top of the pot pie. The second half of the dish tasted just as good later that evening. I love that they serve fresh brewed tea.

I know I sampled the Nachorama (2#&#39;s of nacho&#39;s covered in their award wining chili) my first visit here, as there was some friends that had eyes bigger than their bellies. I also made it here for Tuesdays Mom&#39;s Meatloaf and it&#39;s exceptional. I so want to make it back out for their Saturday Rib diner special and I have plans to attend their event for &#34;Operation Christmas Child&#34;, the event is on the 17th of this month. Check it out on their facebook page and plan on bringing in a shoe box of gifts for a needy child. 

The owner J.R. does so much for his community and is so treasured by his employees... such a rare find. Free WiFi is also a plus! They have a great blog too, that keeps you up to date on all their drink and meal deals. And when it comes to sports.... they have more TV&#39;s than you would expect.

Here&#39;s the link to their episode on Chicago&#39;s Best TV &#34;viewers choice&#34;.

Please do not waste your time with ANYTHING ELSE other than the chicken fingers and honey mustard. I will say everything they make is top notch but if you&#39;re from out of town and you don&#39;t know what to get. GET THE CHICKEN FINGERS. Ask for extra honey mustard. ALSO the nachos. THE NACHOS!!!!! If you&#39;re Hulk Hogan get a full order. If you&#39;re a normal person get a 1/2 order (unless you&#39;re like 8 people or something). The staff is fantastic and amazingly polite/nice/every other good adjective. I always make a point to come here when I am coming back from California :D

So now I&#39;m forced to purchase a higher end beer?
WHAT&#39;S WITH THAT? I would like to have a simple regular domestic draft beer please. 

Their salad dressings was way watered down and it wasn&#39;t just mine. It was like eating a salad drenched in milk. They really need to do this...Not making enough profit?

Place pissed me off

Not for me.

Having grown up in Schaumburg, I have had more than my fair share of trips to Village Tavern, each as disappointing as the next. Back when I ate meat, I did find the chicken fingers to be ok, but nothing to write home about. Now that I&#39;m a vegetarian, I find that I have limited options on this menu. Their pasta sauce is more water than anything else, which is gross. The service is never particularly prompt or friendly. It&#39;s dark and cold inside and, frankly, I don&#39;t have anything positive to say. Unfortunately, I know I&#39;ll be back because there&#39;s no way to avoid this place when you live in the area.

Not because it was bad, on the contrary, it was excellent and more than most could finish at a single sitting. What was wrong was I started to see plates of their signature french toast, grits, waffles and corned beef hash. I vowed to come back.

The following Sunday, when the wife said she wanted to go to breakfast, I seized on the opportunity. When we got there, I thought there would be a wait as there was a serious crowd. We were told about 20 mins. We noticed they had an app called The List that let us track where we were in line. The wait ended up being only about 10 mins. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive, willing to answer any and all questions as well as make suggestions. 

DANG! The french toast, made out of french bread mind you, is unbelievable. Wife had the stuffed pumpkin pancakes with cream cheese filling fused with orange. I started having regrets again when i tried it. The grits are plentiful and great tasting.

Stay away if you are on a diet, all bets will be off. I highly recommend this place."

Hubby ordered the three-piece french toast. Although it was flavorful, he couldn&#39;t finish it, which attests to the fact that the servings are really big. Oh, I already said that. 

My veggie omelette, hash browns, and grits were perfect too. Not overdone, plenty of flavor, and again, way too large. I could only eat half. Did I mention that the portions are crazy large?

If you decide to share, though, there&#39;s a $2 up charge. 

My complaints are minimal, but worth mentioning, I think. There&#39;s a $0.75 up charge for cheese in a veggie omelette! And of course the standard up charge for GF pancakes, which I never understand, especially since it&#39;s the only GF bread they have. I opted for double sides instead. 

Oh, and the water is horrible, which made the coffee taste off too. Then again, the water at the hotel was awful too. Maybe I&#39;m spoiled with Pennsylvania water."
burnt-toast-elgin-3,Natalie K.,FkibF2i1heI-CE4OZi00IA,"Algonquin, IL",1,1,1,87,146,QhIHz6Z39M-He-Q68zbhkQ,5.0,2016-04-02,"I wanted to update my review since in the past two years I&#39;ve become a regular and have tried 90% of their menu items.

Firstly, the restaurant is typically busy on a daily basis. During the week there is never usually a wait, but early mornings/afternoons on the weekend there is sometimes a short wait (I never had to wait for more than 20 minutes). It&#39;s a cozy and very friendly environment, although when it&#39;s busy, it can be quite loud. From the hosts to the servers, we are always treated like family and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been to a restaurant/diner with better staff. Not one negative experience ever. Service is always above par, and I&#39;m never left with a coffee or drink that is less than half full. You can tell that it&#39;s a positive working environment as the servers are always helping each other out (great team work). 

The coffee is good. They have their own special blend created for their restaurant. It&#39;s a light, mild roast, which my husband absolutely loves, but it&#39;s not really my favorite. (This is completely a preference-based thing, but I&#39;m a coffee snob, and I like bolder coffee.) It is always hot and fresh though. 

Their daily soups are all great. A couple of my favorites are the stuffed pepper and cream based selections (especially the Sunday cream of chicken). Highly recommend. 

As far as the food, it&#39;s pretty consistent. The eggs are good quality and are fresh, and the hash browns are shredded and crisp - never greasy. The skillets are excellent. My favorite is the veggie skillet.

They also have good bacon, so whether you get it mixed in with your eggs, on the side or in a BLT, or club, it will be good. It&#39;s slightly thick with a good crisp. 

The pancakes are amazing, and something I think this restaurant excels in. The classic pancakes are really light, fluffy and cakey. They also have multi-grain, which are far better than most restaurants whole wheat/multigrain cakes. The crunch cakes are sooo good (oats, pecans and dried cranberries in the batter). Also their seasonal pumpkin pancakes are another favorite of mine. The French toast and waffles are also very good and would recommend. 

Also, it&#39;s hard to find good gyros in the area, and I have to say that Burnt Toast has some of the best gyros. It&#39;s good quality and always has a nice crisp - no soggy gyros here! They also have a great philly steak with good quality sliced sirloin. Also, if you have a taste for steak, the ribeye is very flavorful and thin.

They have a small menu for lunch, including a nice selection of salads. When I want to up my veggie intake, I like getting the spinach chicken salad which is LOADED with baby spinach. My only qualm is the salad dressings. They are all boring flavored, pre-made dressings and taste like it too. A suggestion to BT would be to PLEASE whip up your own salad dressings!! They would make the salads much more enjoyable! 

I also kind of wish that I loved their crepes more. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they are good, but, crepes are one of my favorite breakfast foods. I&#39;ve tried them around 3-5 times and I feel like they are missing a little something. The crepes are very thin and delicate with a slight crisp, which is great! They are always cooked perfectly! They aren&#39;t sloppy or too eggy tasting like some diners. The batter would easily mix well with savory crepe dishes (would go good with chicken, etc, than a sweet dessert crepe that goes good with fruit preserves) and when I want fruit crepes, I&#39;m always wishing that they would toss a little more sugar or vanilla in the batter. I guess you can say that I like my crepes sweet, and these aren&#39;t.

All in all, for the area, Burnt Toast is my top breakfast place and it doesn&#39;t compare to it&#39;s local competitors.. I&#39;ve tried them all but always return to Burnt Toast."

I recently had the turkey club with avocado on multi-grain bread. OMG, delish! You really can&#39;t screw up a turkey club. Bacon is perfect. I&#39;m not a big fan of the thick cut bacon so I just asked for the regular bacon; which they gladly gave me. 

Usually I have a breakfast skillet (Denver). It comes with so much food. I never can finish. As a matter of fact, I could probably share it with one of my children. Back to the food, it comes with hash browns, toast or pancakes, and a very big helping of eggs. Sheesh!  

Food is fresh, service is good, coffee is always a bit bitter but nothing a little extra cream can&#39;t fix. Price isn&#39;t too bad either. 

I&#39;m craving Burnt Toast for this weekend. It&#39;s so on! Anyone care to join me??"

As soon as we walk in, we were greeted with friendly faces. We were seated right away. Place was pretty packed. 

We were greeted by our server Alyssa. She was very friendly and helpful. 

For drinks Brie ordered pumpkin spice latte. She said it&#39;s ok. I think because there was a bit too much cinnamon for her.  I ordered the hazelnut cappuccino. Mine was very good. Not too sweet and I love the foam on top. 

For breakfast, brie ordered the Cornbeef hash skillet with sunny side up eggs. She loved it. She said it&#39;s better than another restaurant she goes to. Portion is huge so she only ate half.

I ordered the veggie skillet with turkey sausage added and because I wanted to try the pumpkin spice pancake. My meal was delicious. My eggs were cooked just right.  Now for the pumpkin pancakes. They were delish but I didn&#39;t put any syrup since it was already sweet for my taste. I like my pancakes a bit in the crispy side so it could have been cooked a bit more. Again, portions are huge so I only ate half of my pancakes and skillet. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant for breakfast/brunch. Family time, this is the place."

So much so that I&#39;d travel 2 hours to try a new breakfast spot.  Ok, really I was meeting a work team member here too.  But I&#39;m glad she suggested this place. 

I had a feeling I&#39;d be a fan when they seated me even though my party was incomplete--even on a busy Saturday morning.  So nice that I could sit down immeidately and have a cup of coffee. The coffee is delicious by the way. Service was friendly and sunny throughout the whole experience. Our server had to be reminded a couple of time for some things--but they were busy and she was so apologetic that it really didn&#39;t put a damper on our experience. 

I opted for their breakfast burrito. Scrambled eggs, chorizo, peppers and cheese in aflour tortilla..  I love a little spice and this had a nice flavor and was made well.  My son&#39;s pancakes looked good as did my friend&#39;s meal (I can&#39;t remember what she had...sorry night shift brain).

The menu as the usual supsects--eggs, skillets, french toast, pancakes and crepes, but some of them do stand out.  Like the Grand Marnier french toast and some creative omelet dishes. I spied Mimosa&#39;s and a few different flavors of fruit juice which add some interest as well. 

Clean digs, open and sunny."

I ordered the chicken Caesar wrap which seemingly came with no Caesar dressing (I asked for more and was obliged) and seriously the driest chicken I&#39;ve ever eaten. I&#39;ve had better chicken at the hospital across the street, so that&#39;s pretty bad, and it was so shredded and cut into little pieces that they fell out everywhere from the wrap. Just very poor execution on this one. The waffle fries were good, but they were seasoned and they were not toted as such.

I ordered the apple cinnamon silver dollar pancakes, with a side of bacon and hashbrowns. I also ordered a glass of fresh squeezed strawberry orange juice. My boyfriend ordered the Grand Marnier French toast.
His looked really good, and he said it tasted amazing. My pancakes were delicious! Don&#39;t underestimate the sound of &#34;silver dollar pancakes&#34;. My plate was full of them! They actually had whole slices of apple in them too! The hashbrowns were good, but the bacon was a little bit hard. 
I still think the price is a little high, but that is probably for the slightly more upscale set up.

I&#39;ve been here several times. Usually get a classic breakfast of eggs, sausage, hashbrowns, and a side of toast. I&#39;ve also had the French toast, which are not square shaped, but more rounded large pieces of bread. The pancakes are also huge. I don&#39;t think you can really go wrong here.

Four stars because the parking situation is a mess. There are not enough spots to accomodate this place and the pizzeria next door. Worse, there isn&#39;t really an alternative place to park when the lot is full.

I love ordering French toast because I never make it at home. Here are Burnt Toast&#39;s delectable ways to appreciate their &#34;famous&#34; House Specialty:

Their plain French toast is freshly baked French bread, cut thick and topped with organic Indonesian cinnamon sugar. Add Strawberries for $1.00. 

Their Grand Marnier French toast is baked French bread, dipped in Grand Marnier batter then topped with Grand Marnier sauce, sautéed bananas, pecans and cinnamon sugar. You may substitute French bread with Banana Nut bread.

Four stars because I cannot drink their coffee. It has too much caffeine. It requires a lot of sugar and cream. It&#39;s so strong, it gives me anxiety."

Our server, Wesley, was good and a kind person. Our order took a while to come out (to be expected on a busy day), but it did not come out all together. We waited about 5 minutes for the remaining 2 orders to come out and they didn&#39;t. We finally started eating in front of our family members who were still waiting for their food so our food wouldn&#39;t get completely cold. One order came out about 10 minutes after our food came out and the last order came out almost 15-20 minutes later. Three of us had finished eating before the final order of our table came out. 

Our server was very apologetic, but the owner, who we finally spoke to after 15 min of waiting said he would &#39;take care of it&#39; and we never saw him again. Not only that, he refused to take the last order off of our bill. $150 later and he refused to take off the $8 order of crepes that took forever to get to our table.
When we went to pay our bill we explained what happened to the manager and she rudely informed us that it was mother&#39;s day (my mom and I, both Mothers , who were well aware of what day it was) argued that that wasn&#39;t an excuse for poorly managing the situation.

Not that I&#39;d take her advice on anything, but the name of this place kind of drew me in and I was curious to try it...especially after checking out the menu online.

While driving through the area, I told my mom we needed to stop for breakfast because I wanted to try this place, I&#39;m REALLY glad I did!!! The menu is amazing!!! I went over and over and over it and had no idea what I wanted because I wanted to try everything!!! Then I looked at the specials and pumpkin pancakes looked intriguing for a while now, and tis the season for pumpkin everything, so I got the stuffed pumpkin pancakes.  My mom ordered an omelet, but pretty much changed up the omelet entirely from what it was on the menu.  These things were amazing!!!!  - The stuffed pumpkin pancakes, that is.  SO SO GOOD!!!! I posted a picture in here so you can get an idea of what I&#39;m talking about.

Also something different...the strawberry orange juice! Oh, so good!!! I could probably drink that every day if I could, it was awesome!!!

Three of us ordered omelets, one ordered crepes and another ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. One of the omelets was the French style with spinach, sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese. It was dry and flavorless with far too much goat cheese inside and on top. I love goat cheese but it was way too much. I had Canadian bacon on the side which was as dry as shoe leather. Another omelet was the Seafood omelet which was also dry with far too little seafood and far too much cheese. The other omelet was the Spinach and Gruyere. Again, dry and not much flavor. The hash browns were not crispy brown or anything special. The corned beef hash was a flat serving, very crispy and hard and not moist. The crepes were good according to my family member who ordered them. 

Needless to say, we were very disappointed with the food, especially given the prices. We remember much better food a few years ago. May try for lunch as the lunch food coming out looked quite good. 

However, our waitress was very friendly, efficient, attentive and very patient with my mother. We tipped her well. 

I&#39;m not sure what is going on here, but they need to get it together. We won&#39;t be coming here for breakfast anytime soon."

They open fairly early (6:30am) and serve breakfast through close (at 2pm -- my biggest complaint about the whole operation). They also serve lunch at ... er ... lunch time, but I confess I&#39;ve never ordered lunch there. 

My go-to item, morning or midday, is the egg white veggie omelet with fruit and pancakes. Under $10, and it&#39;s easily 2 meals. And healthy! They also have ridiculous more-dessert-than-breakfast stuff on the menu that you have to try -- such as banana split pancakes, stuffed french toast, etc. Their skillets are amazing and their french toast should be renamed divine french loaf, for the two fold reason that it&#39;s *incredible* and *huge*! No normal human being finishes a large order.

They have delicious fresh squeezed juices, but the juice is pricey, so beware. I&#39;ve seen people order huge beautiful salads with all manner of stuff on them that looks really tasty (and risks taking the &#34;healthy&#34; out of &#34;salad), but as I said, I&#39;ve never ordered one.

Our server, Wesley, was good and a kind person. Our order took a while to come out (to be expected on a busy day), but it did not come out all together. We waited about 5 minutes for the remaining 2 orders to come out and they didn&#39;t. We finally started eating in front of our family members who were still waiting for their food so our food wouldn&#39;t get completely cold. One order came out about 10 minutes after our food came out and the last order came out almost 15-20 minutes later. Three of us had finished eating before the final order of our table came out. 

Our server was very apologetic, but the owner, who we finally spoke to after 15 min of waiting said he would &#39;take care of it&#39; and we never saw him again. Not only that, he refused to take the last order off of our bill. $150 later and he refused to take off the $8 order of crepes that took forever to get to our table.
When we went to pay our bill we explained what happened to the manager and she rudely informed us that it was mother&#39;s day (my mom and I, both Mothers , who were well aware of what day it was) argued that that wasn&#39;t an excuse for poorly managing the situation. Terrible management...a reflection of greedy owners."

Not that I&#39;d take her advice on anything, but the name of this place kind of drew me in and I was curious to try it...especially after checking out the menu online.

While driving through the area, I told my mom we needed to stop for breakfast because I wanted to try this place, I&#39;m REALLY glad I did!!! The menu is amazing!!! I went over and over and over it and had no idea what I wanted because I wanted to try everything!!! Then I looked at the specials and pumpkin pancakes looked intriguing for a while now, and tis the season for pumpkin everything, so I got the stuffed pumpkin pancakes.  My mom ordered an omelet, but pretty much changed up the omelet entirely from what it was on the menu.  These things were amazing!!!!  - The stuffed pumpkin pancakes, that is.  SO SO GOOD!!!! I posted a picture in here so you can get an idea of what I&#39;m talking about.

Also something different...the strawberry orange juice! Oh, so good!!! I could probably drink that every day if I could, it was awesome!!!

I wish they had some of these out in the sw burbs, because this is a great breakfast spot.  If I&#39;m in the area again, I&#39;m definitely going to stop in!"

The gravy was just ok.  I typically judge breakfast places on their gravy since I grew up on biscuit and sausage gravy!  I was a little disappointed there.

They did a decent job with my over easy eggs and his scramble with cheese.  The hash browns were ok, they could have been seasoned better and cooked a little longer.

I had the &#34;combo&#34; which is a choice of 2 eggs, French toast/pancakes/waffle, and your choice of breakfast meat. It was a very generous portion.

We ended up here... Finally!  I think I was really just intrigued by the name!

The boy and I both got the same thing (I think for the first time ever).  The Country Fried Steak n Eggs... We agreed the steak part was pretty good!  Not overly done with the breading so you could really taste the steak with was tender.  Well seasoned and not over cooked.  

The gravy was just ok.  I typically judge breakfast places on their gravy since I grew up on biscuit and sausage gravy!  I was a little disappointed there.

They did a decent job with my over easy eggs and his scramble with cheese.  The hash browns were ok, they could have been seasoned better and cooked a little longer.  

The service was good.  We hung out a little longer than normal so we could catch up.  Overall, I felt it was a normal breakfast / lunch place.  The name didn&#39;t make it anything special unfortunately! ;)"

But the pancakes that came with it were absolutely delicious. 

I loved the fact that they had different types of orange juice, too. I had pomegranate-orange juice myself and it was wonderful. 

Paying for the check was stressful because we had to wait in a long line and people kept bumping into us since you pay at the front and they were absolutely crowded. Even the employees were bumping into us.

The hot chocolate was watery and did not taste like Ghirardelli at all...tasted like a powder/water mix. And not a single visit by either of the 2 floor managers wandering around. Won&#39;t be back.

We were told that the wait would be about 10-15 mins. By the time 15 minutes rolled around, the buzzer still had not gone off... so, I got up and asked the host if it would be much longer. Luckily we were seated right away!
The ambiance was clean and the service was nice, and the food came out a lot quicker than expected!

I ordered the combo 2 (2 French toast slices (with strawberries and whipped cream), 2 eggs, 2 bacon slices). The bf got the country fried steak and eggs.
The French toast was so good! It&#39;s definitely &#34;meatier&#34; and had a really nice homemade taste to it. The bacon was thick and chewy (not a huge fan because I like my bacon crispy). The eggs were standard.
The only fault I can find with my meal was the syrup. I prefer to have warm syrup, whereas burnt toast serves it a little lukewarm/cooler. 
I sampled the country fried steak and that was delicious as well!

Needless to say, we did not need a box. We devoured everything :)"

Which is to be expected. Was sat on time, the server came to the table in a Timely manner, but didn&#39;t seem very enthusiastic to see us. Costumer service is a big thing when dining out now, that can make or break a business.. And although the service wasn&#39;t the worst part of my expirence, deffinilty wasn&#39;t the best. 

Order eggs and bacon, which you would think could not be screwed up, wrong. The bacon came out so cripsy, it looked like it was days old. It was cold, and I even hit it with my fork and it make quite the noise. I would not even feed that to my dog, not even close to being edible. So I asked my server to swap it out for some fresh bacon. He didn&#39;t seem very happy about it, and when he came back with the new bacon, he made me give him back the old burnt pieces. Why? Are you going to serve that to another patron? Or do you think I&#39;m lying and I just wanted two orders of bacon? I just find that unsanitary and we&#39;ll rude.

Overall my dining experience  was not very good. The food is greasy. The costumer service is fair at best. The prices, way too high, to substitute gluten free pancakes for regular ones, $3... And a children&#39;s drink is not even included in a meal?

The hash browns it came with were good, too - not drenched in grease like other places I&#39;ve been. The portions are pretty good and half or us ended up with to-go boxes.

Being that we are in the midst of Lent, I was looking for menu options that do not have any meat in them. I was impressed with the options that I had and settled on the veggie skillet. The waitress asked if I wanted chesse on my skillet, told her yes but no chesse on my skillet. Not all that surprised since the waitress was just ok.Coffee was nothing special but drinkable. 

The place was very busy and the waitress seemed rather annoyed that my friend and I wanted to sit and chag since she was not able to turn her table over fast enough. We sat and talked for just about an hour but I did tip her well. 

Doubtful that I will make another special trip out that way."

The scrambled eggs were slightly undercooked and an unpleasant texture.  The bacon was four slices of rather thick bacon, but it was chewy and lacked flavor.  The hashbrowns were ok...nothing special.  The toast was from a nice bread and sadly was the best part of the meal.  Overpriced, undercooked and not worth visiting again."

Which is to be expected. Was sat on time, the server came to the table in a Timely manner, but didn&#39;t seem very enthusiastic to see us. Costumer service is a big thing when dining out now, that can make or break a business.. And although the service wasn&#39;t the worst part of my expirence, deffinilty wasn&#39;t the best. 

Order eggs and bacon, which you would think could not be screwed up, wrong. The bacon came out so cripsy, it looked like it was days old. It was cold, and I even hit it with my fork and it make quite the noise. I would not even feed that to my dog, not even close to being edible. So I asked my server to swap it out for some fresh bacon. He didn&#39;t seem very happy about it, and when he came back with the new bacon, he made me give him back the old burnt pieces. Why? Are you going to serve that to another patron? Or do you think I&#39;m lying and I just wanted two orders of bacon? I just find that unsanitary and we&#39;ll rude.

Overall my dining experience  was not very good. The food is greasy. The costumer service is fair at best. The prices, way too high, to substitute gluten free pancakes for regular ones, $3... And a children&#39;s drink is not even included in a meal? 

If your looking for a great brunch spot, try Brunch Cafe, they never disappoint."

Some of our group got there early to put our name in and as soon as everyone arrived (30 minutes later), we were able to get our table. That was nice. It was pretty much a loud cluster of people inside the doors - very chaotic and mildly annoying.

Our server was quick and attentive without being annoying. She never let my coffee cup get too empty, so I appreciated that. Everybody seemed to enjoy their breakfasts. I got the seafood omelet, which was OK...nothing special. It seemed like it was missing something and I have no idea what. A little disappointing, but still pretty good. The hash browns it came with were good, too - not drenched in grease like other places I&#39;ve been. The portions are pretty good and half or us ended up with to-go boxes.

Overall, it was a good breakfast joint, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth a special trip. If I&#39;m in the area, I&#39;d venture to give it another shot."

He got an entire mickey pancake (huge) with a ton of scrambled eggs and 2 big slices of bacon.  He ate a ton of food and it looked like it barely touched it.  I got the seafood omelet with grits and toast.  The omelet was really good (I did take out some of the cheese), but I could only take a couple bites of the other two things (and the pancake that was on the table).

Unfortunately for all breakfast places out there, I am going to compare you to Nosh or Egg Harbor in Geneva, or Apple Villa in Batavia. The food was good, but not extraordinary. They had freshly squeezed orange juice. I had a veggie omelette with egg whites, hashbrowns, an english muffin, and a large orange juice. With tip, it was $16. My friend had the Seafood omelette (which she enjoyed) and my other friend had the Ghirardelli chocolate chip pancakes with chocolate swirl. 3 pancakes are huge! But they were pretty tasty.

I also noticed they had pumpkin pancakes year round. Yum!

Place was pretty empty.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Food was surprisingly good.  

I ordered the BLT wrap that boasted of thick cut bacon on the menu.  Well, they didn&#39;t lie.  Hands down the best BLT that I&#39;ve ever had the opportunity to snack on.

Food was prompt and very delicious. Very generous portions. Our server was Jenny and she was lovely. Very attentive and quick. Our hostess was Kyla and she definitely stole the show. I have never received greater service from a hostess than I did that day from miss kyla. She reserved our table for us, made sure my son was perfectly  accommodated, and made a latte for my mother and it was the best damn latte she&#39;s ever had. She checked on us when our server was busy, all while answering the phones and seating people walking in. I think that one of the key elements of a restaurant is who greets you when you first walk in the door. Burnt toast by far has lucked out with this girl being the first face to greet you. A++. One star off for the woman who I&#39;m assuming is the owner? Manager? She was circling the restaurant seemingly watching  everyone like a hawk and it was sort of uncomfortable.

I doubt I&#39;ll be back.

It was a Monday morning at 9am.  My friend and I were seated in the middle section right away, which was nice.  And then we waited...and waited...and waited... We had already picked out what we wanted, how we wanted it, what sides to get, and we might have solved the problem of global warming (yes, we were waiting that long) had my friend not flagged down a different waitress serving the next table.  

Long story short, she was our waitress and she didn&#39;t know we were in her section.  She said she didn&#39;t see us.  Which is strange because we made solid eye contact four times before she was stopped.  

**Ghirdelli chocolate chip pancakes: Good, if not a little too sweet (Yes, that can actually happen!! I had no idea!)
**Veggie Omelette: Yummy
**Well done hash browns: Not well done and didn&#39;t really taste good

My only complaint about this place is about how some of the staff is treated. The busboys and table runners are fantastic! I feel bad for them sometimes because I&#39;ve heard the servers bark at them just for doing their jobs. They don&#39;t seem phased by it, probably because they&#39;re used to it, but I hate to see that happen.

Everything was really good but the portions were HUGE! I know a lot of people like giant plates of food but this was not the kind of meal where I could bring the leftovers home and I absolutely hate to think of how much food they must waste everyday. Seriously, there is NO WAY anybody could eat as much food as was presented to me. If you could physically eat that much, there is no way anybody needs to.

I can&#39;t say that I ever had anything bad, but the only thing I had GREAT were the pancakes. I can&#39;t figure out how they do it, but the vanilla flavor in them is amazing! The food arrives after a pretty normal wait. I can tell you one thing I have noticed after all these years. The food is never hot. Its not that its cold, just more room temperature. I do love the fresh squeezed strawberry orange juice though, and they also offer great speciality coffee drinks that could give other coffee shops a run at greatness. If you go on the weekend, be prepared for a wait. Sometimes it could be as long as 45 minutes or more.  The dining room is very bright, but extremely cramped. The tables are very close together. It&#39;s a great place to eat at, I just can&#39;t justify the hour drive each way to eat there anymore."

After just finding out that I had a major meniscus tear that warranted surgery, I needed some comfort.

My sister and I walked in at 1:45pm on a Thursday afternoon.  (Their closing time is 2:30 pm daily.  No all day breakfast here).

Place was pretty empty.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Food was surprisingly good.  

I ordered the BLT wrap that boasted of thick cut bacon on the menu.  Well, they didn&#39;t lie.  Hands down the best BLT that I&#39;ve ever had the opportunity to snack on.  Thick but crunchy flavorful bits of bacon.  Fresh tomatoes and Romaine lettuce in a delectble wrap.  All with a side salad and a huge pickle spear!  Who doesn&#39;t like a big pickle?!"

Food was prompt and very delicious. Very generous portions. Our server was Jenny and she was lovely. Very attentive and quick. Our hostess was Kyla and she definitely stole the show. I have never received greater service from a hostess than I did that day from miss kyla. She reserved our table for us, made sure my son was perfectly  accommodated, and made a latte for my mother and it was the best damn latte she&#39;s ever had. She checked on us when our server was busy, all while answering the phones and seating people walking in. I think that one of the key elements of a restaurant is who greets you when you first walk in the door. Burnt toast by far has lucked out with this girl being the first face to greet you. A++. One star off for the woman who I&#39;m assuming is the owner? Manager? She was circling the restaurant seemingly watching  everyone like a hawk and it was sort of uncomfortable. The  rest of the staff seemed a little up tight.. which kind of killed the relaxed atmosphere..other than that everything  was great!"

The food was very good, the omelette and hash browns were good though the chicken in the omelette tasted precooked. The strawberry orange juice was really good and the service was good."

And even though it can be packed, I have never had to wait very long as they have lots of tables and turn them quickly. Just watch out for Saturday and Sunday mornings and they really bring them in on those days. I think they are a breakfast lunch only place that closes about 2:30 each day. Very friendly service and top quality food with tons of choices. The chicken fried steak and eggs is one of my favorites along with the breakfast tacos. Really good hash browns and several varieties of freshly squeezed juices. This place has sort of become my regular first stop after early morning return flights from the airport."

I doubt I&#39;ll be back.

It was a Monday morning at 9am.  My friend and I were seated in the middle section right away, which was nice.  And then we waited...and waited...and waited... We had already picked out what we wanted, how we wanted it, what sides to get, and we might have solved the problem of global warming (yes, we were waiting that long) had my friend not flagged down a different waitress serving the next table.  

Long story short, she was our waitress and she didn&#39;t know we were in her section.  She said she didn&#39;t see us.  Which is strange because we made solid eye contact four times before she was stopped.  

**Ghirdelli chocolate chip pancakes: Good, if not a little too sweet (Yes, that can actually happen!! I had no idea!)
**Veggie Omelette: Yummy
**Well done hash browns: Not well done and didn&#39;t really taste good

My friend said from now on, she&#39;s leaving me in the car until we get good service before she will let me out--I&#39;m bad luck!!"

I&#39;ve never ordered anything that I didn&#39;t like. The food arrives quickly and tastes fresh. Even when there are a lot of people waiting to be seated, it doesn&#39;t take an absurd amount of time. The servers are usually great too!

My only complaint about this place is about how some of the staff is treated. The busboys and table runners are fantastic! I feel bad for them sometimes because I&#39;ve heard the servers bark at them just for doing their jobs. They don&#39;t seem phased by it, probably because they&#39;re used to it, but I hate to see that happen. I just think it&#39;s tacky and unnecessary, so I had to take a star away, but I am otherwise a huge fan!"

The kids love the happy kids meal and the bacon is so thick and perfectly cooked.  Our favorite server is Mike. He&#39;s always so friendly and attentive even if we aren&#39;t his table.  I highly recommend this place! The only thing I would like to see is the specials changing as they have been the same for a long time and maybe the prices to be slightly cheaper. Also drinks included with the kids meals.

Thankfully we only had to wait about five minutes which was nice. 

The menu was extensive, it was hard to pick what to order! So much of it sounded really good. I ended up getting the two eggs with sausage and hash browns and it also came with a side of pancakes. Everything was really good but the portions were HUGE! I know a lot of people like giant plates of food but this was not the kind of meal where I could bring the leftovers home and I absolutely hate to think of how much food they must waste everyday. Seriously, there is NO WAY anybody could eat as much food as was presented to me. If you could physically eat that much, there is no way anybody needs to. The prices were so good that I would not have felt ripped off to get half the amount of food for the same price! Seriously, Burnt Toast, serve smaller portions!!"

Place always packed, but service always fast and food is delicious. Waitresses always polite and smiling, never had complain about this place always good :) ill suggest to go there and ignore the waiting period, because food and service will cover that. Egg Benedict&#39;s are the best!"

They also offer free Wi-Fi for those that want to get a jump on their day before they head into the office any weekday morning.  

I love their skillets!  Possibly the most filling item on their menu...plus they are cooked to perfection!

The staff is very attentive and aim to please.  They love serving their guests and want to make sure your visit is a great one.

We both LOVED our server, Tamra. She was very friendly and accommodating. Our food came out quickly, was hot, fresh and absolutely delicious. The only reason this place doesn&#39;t get 5 stars is due to a snotty hostess at the front desk. We have been here several times and she is usually at the door. She looked as though we were bothersome just checking in to be seated. She also made my specialty coffee incorrectly and dropped it off with a little bit of attitude. Other than that, it was great."

Both times the food was amazing! I didn&#39;t get anything from the lunch menus but the breakfast is well prepared. First day I had the rib eye steak and eggs! Steak was AWESOME!!! The flavor on that was to die for!!!! 2nd day I over ordered because it was going to be my last day eating at Burnt Toast, the very berry french toast was GREAT!!!! Presentation was beautiful! I also ordered smoked sausage and eggs! I&#39;ve never had such wonderfully flavored smoked sausage before and it was succulent! Service is good too, very impressed!"

Both times I have visited this establishment there was confusion at the hostess stand. Partially because the other parties ahead of my group seem to think everyone should read their minds... No sir- I did not realize asking if you were in line would cause you so much discomfort and stress.

That being said, once you get to your table things should be an easy journey. Service both times was prompt and friendly. There is a pretty vast menu with surprisingly healthy options amongst the comfort foods of breakfast. I&#39;ve enjoyed the eggs Benedict and the veggie omelette. Ask for your potatoes well done and you&#39;ll get crispy potato goodness. You can get omelettes done with just egg whites. The bread and side options are vast. I wish there was one of these closer to home for weekend breakfasts."

It&#39;s our favorite breakfast spot hands down. However, an incident happened last weekend, in which we will never return to the Randall rd location again. In particular, the manager, Veronica, made it a nightmare of an experience. 
When we arrived, we put our name in at the hostess stand as usual. When our name got called, we were making our way to the hostess stand while 2 members of our party were just arriving and finding a parking spot.  By the way, if your full party is not there, they will not seat you. Completely understand and get that. BUT, the hostess sat us, clearly seating 4 out of 6 in our party.  She didn&#39;t say anything to us about the rest of our party.  
We sat down and starting viewing the menu. Next thing we know, the manager, Veronica, came over to our table. She approached us by stating they only seat complete parties and its not fair to other guests. She then asked us the get up from our table and make our way back to the front.  I thought this was absolutely insulting.  I informed her to take it up with her hostess because she sat us, clearly seeing there were 4 out of 6 of us. I told her that its their error not ours, and we were not getting up.  After she continued to argue with us, the other 2 people in our party showed up.  She finally went away from our table after arguing for quite some time. 
Side note, we had a wonderful breakfast and the food was awesome as usual!
Afterwards, we were getting ready to leave, and Veronica came back to the table to argue her point AGAIN!  This is when we told her that it was ridiculous to ask guests to leave a table they&#39;ve already been sat at. She kept saying, &#34;you won&#39;t see it from my side.&#34;  We said that&#39;s fine, we just won&#39;t come back here. In which she replied, &#34;no problem.&#34;  
Needless to say, we will never return to the Randall rd Burnt Toast again because of how rude and uncalled for the manager, Veronica, treated us.  Horrible customer service!"

The staff is very friendly....the food is excellent, the prices are just right....the parking lot is not large enough to service the customers but ample parking is available at the restaurant next store....if I have one gripe it would be with the noise level it could be very loud at times.

I recommend this restaurant to anyone!"
burnt-toast-elgin-3,Amanda S.,T7FVQAoonDv3QcuTHfK4Jw,"Saint Charles, IL",0,1,0,116,10,k6RZIp6_5_ZSOA1B9EdUvQ,4.0,2012-01-04,"I&#39;m so f-ing full right now that I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;m capable of writing about food but I will try...
The strawberry orange juice:  Ri-goddam-diculously amazing.  So sweet, slightly tart, the perfect marriage of orange and strawberry with just enough seeds to know it&#39;s legit fresh SOJ.
The mocha latte:  large shallow cup, thick layer of perfect foam and a chocolate drizzle?  O yeaaa.  The latte itself wasn&#39;t the greatest ever, I would have preferred it a little stronger and a little less sweet..but that&#39;s what I get for ordering the caffeinated version of hot chocolate.
The strawberry stuffed French toast:  Is this real life?  It appeared before me, like some type of sugary panini..two thick layers of perfectly browned toast, piled high with a mountain of whipped cream littered with strawberries in syrup and filled generously with cream cheese.  To die for.  I could never eat this for a meal, but my bf sho did and when I took a bite I was instantly jealous of his sweets eating capabilities.
The seafood omelet:  Admittedly a borderline idiotic choice.  It sounded kind of interesting and not incredibly unhealthy so I went for it.  An interesting blend of shrimp, scallops, crab meat, cheese, and onions...I&#39;m still not really sure what I thought.  I guess it was a weird combination and I&#39;ve never seen anything like that offered so I figured why not try it.  It was decent but I&#39;d probably order something else when I return.
The hash browns:  crispy on top and thinly laid across the plate, just how I like it.  No heaping piles of browned top with undercooked mounds of potatoes just beneath to be seen @ BT.  A smaller portion than most other breakfast joints, but no complaints. I&#39;d rather have a smaller portion of quality than a big pile o sh*t (IHOP).
The pancakes:  pretty good.  Not that most amazing ever, but I&#39;m not much of a pancake gal as it is, so I was satisfied.  They give you three as a side which was more than enough.  I had a few bites and that was good enough for me.
The garbage potatoes:  Looked phenom but I didn&#39;t have any.  It&#39;s basically a skillet full of hash browns loaded with onions, green peppers, diced ham and topped with cheese.  Since I don&#39;t eat ham and I was on the verge of becoming one due to the consumption of the aforementioned food/drinks, I didn&#39;t even attempt a bite.  My bf really liked them however.
Our server was nice.  We got there @ about 1:40, and they close at 2:30 so at first I felt she was kiiinda trying to rush us but I quickly told her we had never been there and I had some dietary restrictions so just gimme a minute and she def did.  By the time she returned we had decided and we got along for the remainder of the meal.  
I will def return, perhaps when I&#39;m in the mood for something sweet because by judging my bf&#39;s French toast and some of the other dishes I saw come out of the kitchen, those seem to be their specialty.
The ambiance was nice, a little classier than your typical breakfast digs with a nice selection of coffee drinks, juices and even mimosas!!"

People waiting behind the counter cannot clear the occuppied tables, dont get frustrated at them either.

 i always want to try one of everything, unfortunately my stomach wont hold it all.
my usual is 2 eggs w/ bacon &amp; side of french toast. this place has the best french toast that has ever been in existence! love love love it! my husband gets the meat lovers skillet no matter where we go for breakfast, every where we go he always says &#34;not as good as Burnt Toast&#34;.  In the fall they have pumpkin specialties, i tried the pumpkin waffle... omg, it was so so good i actually ordered one to go &amp; warmed it up that night for dinner. I&#39;ve also had the hot chocolate, i thought i had died &amp; gone to heaven. 

we&#39;ve brought friends here &amp; everyone always says its a great place this is, i wish they would open a location in schaumburg/hoffman estates, but regardless we&#39;ll always make the trip to Elgin for our favorite breakfast place!"
burnt-toast-elgin-3,Thomas L.,qNmcbY0f-pJNGY0Gx3Ss-A,"Crystal Lake, IL",0,1,0,4,10,c30a_cGH15c0d3RQZ4p9fw,2.0,2011-12-16,"I had the Biscuits and Gravy with two poached eggs.  The poached eggs were alright.  The Biscuits and Gravy, the main part of the meal, left  a lot to be desired.  

- The biscuits were stale, and hard to cut.
- The gravy was flavorless, and was basically country gravy without any flavor and just a few pieces of sausage thrown in.
- The coffee was disreputable.   IMHO, if I go to a &#34;breakfast&#34; restaurant I expect to have a cup of coffee that taste like a cup of coffee and not &#34;brown dishwater&#34;.  I don&#39;t expect it to be Starbucks strength, but seriously it shouldn&#39;t look like tea either.

The only place I&#39;ve found around here that really understands that Biscuits and Gravy is supposed to be a &#34;Sausage Gravy&#34; and not a &#34;Country Gravy&#34; is the The Olympic in Crystal Lake.

My definitions:

Sausage Gravy: you start with the white gravy base used for a country gravy, but then you season and cook it with ground up breakfast sausage.  It should end up with a light brown coloring from the sausage.

Country Gravy: start with a basic white gravy base and add salt and pepper to taste.  Yes, it should taste like something, hence the salt and pepper.  It should not taste bland and boring.

Makes me wonder if the burnt toast is any good?"

There seems to always be a wait at Burnt Toast Elgin, even if just 10 minutes, which is how long the two of us waited before being seated. The place is popular, and busy, which is noticeable not only by the noise level or crowded tables, but by the amount of food on the floor. Our booth had everything from crushed cereal to cutlery and chunks of toast under it when we were seated. I asked for it to be swept and it was done immediately. Our waitress greeted us right away offering coffee and juice, giving us as much time as we needed to order without being rushed (instead asking if she could bring us ice water while we read over the menu some more). I enjoyed that detail to start the meal off, no one likes to be pushed around when out for Sunday Brunch. 

 I ordered the Combo #1 (2 eggs, ham &amp; 2 slices of French Toast), my husband ordered Combo #2 (the same as above except with bacon instead of ham). I asked for eggs over medium, he ordered over easy &amp; we both drank plain coffee.
Our meals came out in a reasonable amount of time, the French Toast topped with a generous amount of cinnamon sugar and the eggs sunny side up. 
Up next, a test of egg cooking skill... over easy vs over medium is a fine line with an egg! I know, I absolutely LOVE eggs and know how to cook them well. This test was FAILED however. Both orders came out with yokes as runny as a nose (hungry now?), which I can handle, but isn&#39;t what I ordered. I don&#39;t send eggs back unless they are health code violation  raw, so that was that. 
The bacon was cooked perfectly, not floppy and not burnt, just crisp and medium to thick cut. The ham was pan seared and tender, just the way it should be. No complaints there. 
The French Toast is served thick cut from fluffy loaves of bread, which looks beautiful plated. The taste was good, but I couldn&#39;t get over how dry it was. It is lightly battered in egg, so the thick slices don&#39;t absorb the egg mixture. It didn&#39;t appear to have been buttered before topped with the cinnamon sugar, so the result was a mouthful of dry bread and dry sugar. I found myself topping it with butter and syrup (went back for syrup 3 times in an attempt for moisture). When I make this dish at home, using a thick slice of bread such as challah loaf, I let the bread soak up the egg &amp; milk batter enough that if you add sugar, you shouldn&#39;t need a dump of syrup too. The though did cross my mind while chewing that they were worried about cost so thus the lack of batter, the thought also crossed my mind that this is just their idea of good French Toast, which then lead me to believe I could open a great breakfast diner one day.... Pipe dreams. Should have ordered the Grand Marnier battered French Toast instead (it just sounded too sweet).

 The ambiance is a well lit , high ceiling room with high noise level but good air circulation (thank goodness, the guy in booth behind me  had awful B.O. which we could smell while be ate... not the restaurant&#39;s problem but yeesh...).

OVERALL: Our waitress was a professional by all means, very cool. The food was nice looking and average tasting. Try going for the specialty items over the basic breakfast items. The prices are average (about $8 per meal without drinks or extras), and BONUS: they let you take home an additional fresh cup of coffee to go (no additional charge), which make&#39;s your $2.49 per cup all the worth while (I loved that)."

Yuck.......your underlying sauce is the foundation of any and all pizzas and yours failed miserably.

Sauce.........simple to do and makes or breaks the pizza.

Very disappointed in the bland, icky pizza sauce.............you might want to think something else.

Did I say it reminded me of Gene and Jude&#39;s? That&#39;s for good reason... I guess it was started by their daughter and the dogs remain the same!

I&#39;m a lover of both the grilled chicken sandwich and the mini-beef -- the perfect size, and nice and juicy!

And my favorites remain the shakes! You can taste that they are made from real ice cream. Topped with whip cream and a wafer cookie -- perfection!

Service is always good -- they always get it right, and it gets delivered quickly!

This review is solely based on their Italian Beef sandwich. I placed my order for an Italian Beef with giardinera.
Now, Italian Beef is one of my favorite things and I have had them from many spots throughout Chicagoland. 
I received my beef sandwich and parked myself at a table. Now eating an Italian Beef sandwich can be almost like a commitment sometimes that once you pick it up, you&#39;re kind of committed to finish it since it can become somewhat fragile due to the beef juice.
Wow. I have to say that this was one tasty sandwich. The beef was very flavorful, the giardinera was spicy. It was also messy. I&#39;m OK with messy as long as the sandwich is worth it and this one definitely was worth it.
If I am in the area, I will stop back for sure to have another one.

I ordered the meal deal with the Nana&#39;s hot dog, mini beef, and drink.

Decor: There isn&#39;t much to this place - it&#39;s a bit of a &#34;hole-in-the-wall.&#34; But, as any good Yelper knows, these type of places have the best food! And Nana&#39;s is no different. But I digress... there are a handful of tables and not much to look at on the walls. It is a clean place, well taken care of for sure.
Bathroom: It&#39;s in the back, through the kitchen, but it is clean and inviting.

Staff: While everyone was nice, they were a bit slow (from what I remember). We did not have a complicated order but it still seemed to take awhile for them to make - and there was NOT a big crowd at all.

Food/Drink: The food is classic Chicago hot dog joint fare. They have a little bit of everything but we went with what they do best: hot dogs and beef. The dogs come with fries (some of the BEST around) and the beef was extra juicy. The only thing I was a bit disappointed with is a hot dog with &#34;everything&#34; is not a standard Chicago-style dog - it is lacking several key ingredients. I will remember for next time, however.

Value: The food is cheap for what you get. Great quality and great value!

The outside looks old..vintage I guess. But, don&#39;t judge a book by the cover. Good, cheap food.

Having had several people recommend I review this place, I finally made the voyage to Nana&#39;s to try it for myself.

First off let&#39;s go over the hot dog. Nana&#39;s serves a natural casing Vienna Beef dog on a very soft bun. The bun does not have poppy seeds like most Chicago style hot dogs. Pickles, peppers and celery salt do not come standard on the Nana&#39;s dog and because I was unaware of this I failed to ask for a pickle on my hot dog, so I can&#39;t comment on that. But the application of condiments on my hot dog was perfect, the bun was soft with some fry grease soaked in as the fries are bundled in the same wrapper as your hot dog. The sport pepper wasn&#39;t too hot. The relish is sweet and flavorful and the onions were perfect. If you make sure to ask for the optional pickle, peppers and celery salt, the only thing missing from this being a near perfect Chicago style hot dog is the poppy seed bun. This hot dog is absolutely fantastic and stands among the best I&#39;ve found anywhere in the city or suburbs.

I also decided to try the cheeseburger, this was a well grilled masterpiece of flavor on a sesame seed bun. The condiments were applied well and this was just a fountain of wonderful flavor. This is possibly the best fast food burger I&#39;ve ever had. It wasn&#39;t too greasy, but maintained that char grilled flavor that makes a fast food burger great.

The fries included are tasty fresh cut fries, very similar to those served by Gene and Jude&#39;s in River Grove. They are mashed into the hot dog in a similar fashion as well. They&#39;re not too greasy, but what grease does reach the hot dog simply soaks into the bun.

Overall Original Nana&#39;s easily exceeded my expectations, this is one of the top five fast food places I&#39;ve found anywhere. I can&#39;t recommend this place enough!"

Its not as it once was, frankly its gone through three major changes since the original family first sold it, and none of them have improved the business, service, and the quality has only gone down.

The latest &#34;remodel&#34; which incorporated a drive through window, also eliminated the customer bathroom.

So, if you need to &#34;go&#34; or just wash your hands, you have to navigate through the kitchen, storage,   and food preparation area to do so.

Although they grill in front of you, and re-fry the fries in front of you, the vast majority is just final assembly in the front.  The prep or pre-prep is all done in the back.

One trip through same, and if you&#39;re wearing your glasses (or if you don&#39;t need glasses, you&#39;re paying attention to what you pass by/through, as well as pay attention to what you have traveled to) I&#39;m thinking you, like me, won&#39;t ever be back.

Bit of a regular of their delivery service, never been to the actual location.

Small corner spots, run by a mom &amp; pop or family situation with delicious food, fresh cut fries &amp; incredibly cheap prices. This was back in the 80s &amp; 90s mind you &amp; its hard to find places in the suburbs that mimic the food or the prices, till Nana&#39;s. The prices are crazy low and there&#39;s no minimum order amount required for delivery! Incredible! No one does that out in these parts so I love that about them. The service is super fast &amp; everything is always hot upon arrival. Their hot dogs are delicious, with a lil give to them if that makes any sense. Just like the old days. I like their slices too, melted cheese with a buttery crust &amp; more than like three pepperoni slices on the actual pepperoni slices. It used to bug me that they placed the fries on top of the dog, so I&#39;d request them on the side, but I actually like it now. And they don&#39;t water down their sodas, major plus!

My in-laws ate here when they first moved to Streamwood 31 years ago.  And Nana&#39;s is still there on Irving Park Rd. serving up some of the quickest and tastiest hot dogs and fries around.

The decor isn&#39;t much to look at; a high counter, a few tables and booths about, all worn and needing a fresh coat of paint.  BUT, you aren&#39;t here for the decor.  You want a dog!  You want it fast!  And you want it cheap!

All the dogs come with fries, literally.  The dog is covered in fries and then wrapped up tightly in deli paper.  This can be a tad messy so don&#39;t even think about trying to eat one of these in the car.  The fries are fresh and you can watch them put the potatoes in the special do-hickey to cut them up.

They have other traditional dog-joint fare on the menu like pizza puffs, beefs and the like.  They even have those yummy Mexican bottled sodas and GREEN RIVER soda at the fountain.  And if you like their fun retro logo you can even buy a t-shirt :-)"

It&#39;s a little dive place on Irving Park Road. 

Here&#39;s what we&#39;ve had there:

1) Double Dog, Easy Mustard: Great snap. Perfectly steamed!!
2) Fries: Typically, I&#39;m not a fan of handcut fries. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the oil here or what, but their fries are great. Not soggy, not burnt tasting.
3) Chili Dog: Husband claims it&#39;s great.
4) Cheese Pizza: Meh. Was great for my kid after football, I&#39;d like to try it with something on it before I give a full evaluation.
5) Onion Rings: TO DIE FOR.
6) Cheese Sticks: Good, nothing special.
7) Chicken Strips: Good. Can tell it&#39;s real chicken breast.
8) Drink Options: GREEN RIVER and other assorted drinks.
9) Double Cheeseburger: Was pleasantly surprised. It was Great! Next time I&#39;m going to see if I can get a Bacon Cheesburger!

Speed of delivery is average. But what stands out are the grill guys. These dudes are workhorses. If there was a lull in walk in traffic -- they were cutting fries. They were constantly working hard. And they make great food!

BONUS: Nana&#39;s delivers. :)"

My husband wanted a triple cheeseburger (which he has gotten there before. We pay a little extra, but it&#39;s what he wants.) The cashier (who I assume was the manager) told us &#34;no, but you can get a double and a single&#34;. Well sir... I don&#39;t want the bun or the condiments. All I want is an extra patty and piece of cheese. That was b.s. I&#39;m also not crazy about the fact that they lump the fries in with the hotdogs. What would be the big deal about putting them in a different bag? Also the fried mushrooms are mushy, and the fries could be a little crispier. All in all... I wouldn&#39;t go back that often. I think I&#39;ll go to Portillo&#39;s instead. (Past review)

(New review) I liked their facebook page and posted the same complaint. A couple hours after posting this and posting on their facebook page,  I received a comment back. They apologized and said on my next visit to ask for the manager and they would fix this. Also they would be happy to make a triple cheeseburger! Now that is what I call customer service. I have changed my review to reflect how happy I am! Now I definitely will be returning to Nana&#39;s! Also about the fries....

I live in Streamwood.  I want to love this place.  Why do they make it so hard for me?

I keep giving them second chances and they keep blowing it.  First off, who sells hot dogs in the greater Chicagoland area and doesn&#39;t make them Chicago style by default???  Why do I have to request Chicago style and why do they still get it wrong?  So I changed my approach and asked for each item individually.  How do grilled onions make their way on a Chicago style dog?  Why can&#39;t I get a pickle and why are there no poppyseeds on the buns?  The cashiers are high school kids who are more interested in doing anything but helping you, which I can live with, but can I just get a hot dog the way I want it?  Chicago style, people.  It&#39;s not that complicated."

I come here every once in a while when i&#39;m near the area.  All their dogs come with fries jammed into the dog so if your into that kind of thing, this place is for you.

Personally I don&#39;t like this style because all the fries sop up alot of the toppings so I end up having to eat fries with onions and relish on them. 

The fries by themselves are great and clearly freshly cut everyday. 

The hot dog is also as good as a portillos dog I would say. Nice juicy pop when u bite into them.  

One of the better features of this place is green river soda available in bottles. Stop by for a quick bite sometime if you&#39;re in the mood for a good dog w/fries. You wont regret it."

They had good milk shakes but I&#39;ve given up on that too, since the last several times I&#39;ve went my shake was literally the consistency of milk.

Easy to find right off Irving Park Rd. I had my first dog from NaNa&#39;s in 1974.

I remember the day well, my father asked what I wanted on my hot Dog and I replied, &#34;I want a hamburger&#34;. Dad ordered me hot dog with mustard, relish and onions - The NaNa&#39;s STD dog. In fact, for a long time that was all that was offered as far as toppings, kind of like Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s. Nowadays, you can get it with ketchup, sport peppers and celery salt if you like. My advice for those who enjoy  ketchup on your dog, order two and try one with mustard, relish, onions (add sport peppers if you like&#39;em). The fries are heavenly, served right on top of the dog. Its o.k., just move the fries off of the dog but make sure to leave a few on top, trust me. French fries are fresh cut and blanched first, which is really the best way to cook fresh cut fries.

 I know everyone in Chicago thinks Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s is the bomb but I have had both. Nana&#39;s dogs have the same snap to the hot dog when you bite into it - essential for the true Chi-town dog! I grew up with NaNa&#39;s and I have been tellin&#39; everyone about it for years. Now I&#39;m yelpin&#39; it - NaNa&#39;s is simple, original, consistent and still there after all these years. My kids love it too! Beefs, gyros and pizza too.

On the way to Jimmy John&#39;s (we don&#39;t have them in CA) I saw Nana&#39;s. Looked like a cool local place so I stopped in.

Somewhat small but clean interior. Plenty of seating at 12:30 on a Tuesday.

I got the original dog, which is mustard, onions and relish and comes with fresh cut fries. They put the fries on top of the dog and wrap it all up, which was a bit odd and left a few fries intertwined with the dog.

I wasn&#39;t a fan of the fries. I like natural cut, but these were just a bit too soggy for me (I like crispy fries, but the flavor of these was good, just not crispy enough).

The dog was very good. A bit heavy on the onions, and nowhere close to Burney&#39;s in Auburn, CA, but tasty enough.

I&#39;d go back and try other things (they do burgers and other stuff too)."

Fries: Neither my husband nor I cared for them, and I am a huge fry junkie.  Maybe this is one of those things that needs to be eaten THERE because mine were soggy and cold:
Regular hot dog: My husband said it was pretty good!
Onion Rings: Absolutely delightful!!!

First up they added pizza to their menus. The slices are huge and cheap! Are the best in the world? Not really but they are pretty good. One slice could probably feed to average adult eaters.

They also started a Facebook page and if you add them you can get a free slice of pizza or a free hot dog!

If your a fan of Gene &amp; Judes, their hotdogs are similar in style and also on how they wrap it up. The dogs are wrapped with fries on top. If you ask they can put the fries on the side for you. The fries are cut fresh from real potatoes not the frozen stuff you may find at some places. The have the potato slicers mounted on their wall and you can see them slice them when they are low on fries. Unlike Gene &amp;Jude you can add ketchup to your dogs here! Sacrilege! 

It appears as if they might have picked up on their customer service and freshness of their food or perhaps they started reading yelp or other review sites and took to heart what people have to say. In any case, it&#39;s good for us and good for them!"

The combo is pretty close to perfect. The only thing that I wasn&#39;t too impressed w/ was the fries. It&#39;s probably just my preference though.

I visited more frequently when I used to live in Streamwood, but now that I have moved and I am a little more conscious about eating junk food, I save Nana&#39;s for special occasions.

Those occasions are when I just need to have the best dogs, burgers, beefs, fries, and malts!

Nana&#39;s is a small place decorated in the traditional yellow and red scheme.  The private parking lot is plenty big in proportion to the tiny amount of seating inside.  They do a lot of takeout business.  I like my stuff hot and fresh, so I tend to eat in.

Walking in the door puts you right in front of the counter where you can order your food.  Be aware of the definitions of &#34;everything&#34; which are posted on the wall for hot dogs and hamburgers.  Nana&#39;s definitions may be different than yours.  It&#39;s no big deal though, because they will do the toppings any way you like, you just may have to say something other than &#34;everything&#34;.  They conveniently accept credit cards too.

After ordering you can mill around in front of the counter waiting for your order or go pick one of the hard surface booth seats.  I think there are about 6 four seaters  and 2 two seaters.
A few minutes after you order someone will announce in a half mumble as they set some food on top of the counter down from where you ordered.  This may or may not be your food depending on how many people were ordering. Also depending on what you ordered, it may not be complete.  This usually happens when I order malts which take longer to make.  So keep an eye and an ear out and eventually you will get everything.  On the way back to your table, be sure to grab ketchup, mustard and napkins from the counter as there are none on the table.

So finally I get to the food.   I love that the hot dogs have that &#34;snap&#34; to them from the old fashioned casings.  I love the fresh cut fries, which they make by pushing a whole potato, skin and all through the cutter and right into the fryer.  What I am not as fond of is that when I order a hotdog, they serve the fries and dog wrapped together.  This tends to make everything a little too soggy.  I also get the Italian beef and the combo occasionally.  Very tasty and soaked and au jus as it should be.  The final belly buster that I can never resist are the malts.  They are big, thick and delicious.  They are topped with whipped cream and a wafer cookie.  Practically a meal in themselves, we always get two just because I cannot decide on what flavor I want.  The banana and chocolate are my two favorites.
They do a lot of promotion around the Gi-Nana-mous pizza slices, but I have never had one.  Having seen them on display, I am not even tempted.  They are huge, but it just looks like standard fast food pizza.

Overall, I like Nana&#39;s for what it is.  There is no service or ambiance to love, but that is not why I come here.  This is the way fast food is supposed to be... the way it was before the corporations refined it into a terrible cookie cutter experience of bland food.
As long as I can still look down and see my shoes, I will be back to Nana&#39;s for my fast food fix."

We started off with some warm fresh bread that was served with some garlic butter and an olive tapenade. It was delicious! We got the fried calamari (off the specialties menu), which was probably one of the best I&#39;ve had. For the main course, I chose the Black Pasta (a popular dish recommended by our waiter), and my husband chose a veal dish that was off the specialties menu. Both were very tasty.

Waste of my money. Anyway nothing good restaurant in downtown Arlington heights anyway. There is only good atmosphere.
But waiters were nice so I gave them good tip and 2 stars. Otherwise 1.

Added, they proudly serve squid ink pasta. But please, if you serve this, please learn how to cook this pasta. They cook with cream sauce and squid ink pasta was over cooked angel hair pasta. The restaurant owner or chef doesn&#39;t know how to serve this type of pasta at all. 
Seafood tomato sauce pasta...... it just shows only how it looks good and taste nothing. They put few big clams which is unnecessary to use it for this type of pasta. Pasta was soggy.....

People who give good review about this place, they probably don&#39;t know what is good Italian restaurant about. Well, sometimes restaurant follows customers needs, so they probably serve what is the customers like.

We walk in around 8-8:30 on a Saturday, the place is crowded; we think its a good sign. We get seated in the little nook, service was just okay. The waiter seemed uninterested in us and making small talk, just did his minimal duties - which is fine, I get it. Not every night can be your star performance. We felt like the menu was very limited in selection. 

The pre-dinner bread and butter garlic was a cool start. But I wish the bread was warmed up or toasted or something- but alas I will survive. 

We also had unexpected guests dinning with us... ANTS, ants were crawling all over the wall next to us- disgusting. 

The food was greasy, bland and terrible. I ordered the chicken, and my boyfriend ordered a pasta dish. We both did not finish our food due to how bad it was, this says alot, because we never leave food behind! The side potatoes were discolored and just drenched in oil- unappetizing.

Our meal began with our hosts pushing in our seats for us and pouring our water.  Warm bread with some kind of olive/garlic tapanade as well as garlic butter quickly followed, so we were already off to a good start.

The two of us split &#34;La Bella&#34; salad, featuring arugula, pears, figs, goat cheese and cranberries in a citrus vinaigrette dressing.  It was every bit as good as it sounds!  We then split the mussels and clams appetizer for our entree.  They brought each of these dishes to our table already split into two plates for us, which was greatly appreciated.  Between the salad, seafood, and never-ending bread, by the end of the meal we were full and satisfied.  Everything was excellent; the only criticism I can offer is that the angel hair spaghetti with the seafood seemed overcooked, and I feel like any legit Italian place should be able to get that al dente texture right.  So I can&#39;t vouch for the pasta, but otherwise we were thrilled with our main dishes.

I&#39;m confused by some of the reviews below because the service was SUPER personable and friendly.  You could tell that the owners remembered their regulars and it constantly seemed like a reunion of old friends anytime patrons entered the doorway.  And even though I had never been here before, I had no sense of neglect.  Everyone was super friendly!  Moreover, every single member of the staff was attentive and buzzing about, serving or cleaning or otherwise just providing a great experience for guests.

The environment is great and the bar is great. That&#39;s four greats. Then there is the men&#39;s bathroom. Oh yeah. It&#39;s great too!!!!!

I had the calamari, veal, and beans. Delicious. Then the after dinner sip and cannoli were divine."

From the warm bread accompanied by garlic butter and tapenade.  Great bar drinks.  The waiter recommended Veal Carlos and it was one of the best few all dishes I&#39;ve ever had.

Had the seafood pasta which was devine.

In the summer you can sit outside by the fountain which is nice.

Service was a little slow but not an issue for us."

The atmosphere is very quaint. There is one TV by the bar (they had soccer on when we came in). There are a few platters on the wall honoring VIP/long-time loyal customers. You can also see one of the chefs making the ravioli/pasta by hand. It looks so yummy!

When you first sit down, you will be greeted with fresh, warm bread with garlic herb butter and  an olive tapenade. Eat it. All of it. It&#39;s so good!! I had to stop myself because I didn&#39;t want to ruin my appetite. The menu features a variety of pastas, chicken, veal, and fish. I had the penne farcita and was not disappointed! My friend had the chicken parmesan and it was huge!! Probably the biggest chicken parm I have ever seen. So, it&#39;s worth the money.

We left very full, so we did not get dessert. However, they all looked amazing, and if I were to go back I would order the espresso brulee. Or the tiramisu, because you can&#39;t go wrong with that.

They have a nice wine list as well. They have a house wine in almost every traditional variety for $8.50 that is actually very good. 

Also, they had free butter cookies to eat on your way out! I wish every place gave me a cookie just for coming in. Awesome!"

The bread brought out was very different.  They served it with a tapenade and a great cheese, herb butter.  We had a caprese salad, which was a take on it and not really traditional. We each had one of their great house made pastas.  My wife had a seafood dish with black pasta.  I had a spinach ravioli that was great in a simple sage butter sauce.  We will definitely be back."

Came here on the suggestion of a colleague and it did not disappoint. Greeted as we walked in with a friendly smile and sat right down. Waiters were attentive and friendly.

The bread was fresh warm and crispy. We had the grilled calmari appetizer with tomatos and capers and it was really tasty. I ordered the veal milanese which came with roast potatos and cauliflower. It was really good. My wife had the pasta with langostino in a creme sauce which she loved.

The wine was ok but a little overpriced. All in all a terrific experience."

We came in at 6pm on a Sunday and the place was empty so that should have been my first clue but I came in opened minded.  The service was good but the food was some of worst we have ever had.

It started off with bread that was extremely hard, almost like it had been sitting out.  We then were given salads &#34;on the house&#34; that had dressing that tasted like caesar gone wrong.  Almost all you could taste was anchovies.

Finally, the meals came and things got worse.  We ordered spinach raviolI that was very undercooked and super salty.  The spaghetti and meatballs tasted like they were frozen and the pasta was not fresh. Also both entrees were very greasy.

Overall,  I would recommend Maggianos in Schaumburg or Giacomos in Des Planes if you want good Italian food."

I don&#39;t usually crave Italian food but this place has me hooked. The 2 times I&#39;ve been here wasn&#39;t too busy and staff was super friendly! I made a reservation online and I got a personal email back saying they couldn&#39;t wait to have us which I thought was so cool!!  and strange haha

Appetizer: fried calamari. I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s in here but I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. The fried calamari comes on a bed of salad. The flavoring of the salad is so good.. I could probably eat this dish as my entree but the menu is too delicious to just eat appetizer  

Entree: I&#39;ve had the black pasta and gnocchi di casa. The sauce for the black pasta is SO GOOD. I didn&#39;t really like their gnocchi dish bc the sauce tasted greasy and fatty but I loved the gnocchi. On my 2nd visit, I requested the gnocchi but with the black pasta sauce and they were more than willing to accommodate. 

My friends had the spaghetti and meatball which i thought was also really good. I also tried their penna farcita and did not enjoy that dish at all. :(

Knocking off a star bc on my 2nd visit here everything tasted SUPER salty and my salad was SUPER greasy. Guess the chefs were different. I&#39;ll just assume it was an off day bc I still want to go back some time again. Just request them to go easy on the salt and grease.

Overall, I would be back bc this place has me constantly thinking of italian food now. Carb overload..."

Appetizers included the grilled calamari (good but saucy, and I wish it was fried) and the caprese salad. 

Entrees were linguine pescatore (too salty), black pasta (the best dish we ordered), risotto with shrimp, and beet salad. 

We ordered the chocolate lava cake (delicious and served a la mode with Neapolitan ice cream), peach cobbler (also excellent and served a la mode), and crime brûlée (coffee flavored? But good as well).

Complimentary warm bread with olive tempanade and tasty butter combination spread. 

The wine selection is fairly large with a refreshing Sauvignon blanc that we really enjoyed. Overall good experience with friendly wait staff, food was not as exquisite but still good."

Plus we thought, by the name, it was Mexican.  And because there are two very good Mexican restaurants on either side of it we never bothered going back.  Fast forward about 7 years.  We&#39;re talking to a coworker who mentioned how good this place&#39;s ITALIAN food is, and we decided to give it another try.  Well I&#39;ve been there twice and I still can&#39;t get past ordering the spaghetti and meat balls.  It they weren&#39;t so good, I&#39;d try something else. :-)  The first time we went we ordered dessert and they brought around complementary after dinner drinks like brandy, burbon and many others.  This time we skipped dessert and getting the free drink.  Even though I had spaghetti and meatballs, the two other people I was with ordered filets and it looked so good I just had to try it.  I&#39;m a big filet guy and I have to say I&#39;d put that filet up against ANY filet I&#39;ve eaten, including ones at Ruth&#39;s Chris, Mortons, and Gibsons.  With 2 filets, 2 glasses of wine, 2 beers and spaghetti the bill came to around $45 per person without tip."

Then I went to the restroom, my gf asked for the wine menu and was told to wait until I got back. Then after choosing what wine she wanted, was asked for an ID after showing it was told it didn&#39;t look like her and and he needed to see something else to make sure it was her. Then after waiting for about 30-40 minutes was finally able to get the servers attention to order...and I&#39;ve worked in a restaurant for many years mostly back of the house but also front work as well and as we were seated inside there was barely any tables that our server had. Then we made the server aware that my gf had a severe shellfish allergy and after rolling his eyes at her when she said that...even though she ordered a chicken pasta dish with no shellfish in it. The food came to the table and asked the runner if they made sure no shellfish touched or was near it and they said yes it was prepared totally separate...food tasted amazing but about 10 min after my gf starting to eat her food her mouth felt really tingly and swollen...the only plus to this experience was obviously the server could tell we were dissatisfied and brought is free dessert.
After having to go to the emergency room afterwards and be there all night because of the lack of care provided, kinda makes me disgusted to say that I&#39;m a chef, very severe allergy not to be taken lightly and it was just not cared about at all...no manager to talk too at all. I would mention the servers name but never once did he introduce himself or tell us his name during the whole time being there. Service was terrible, never recommend this place to anyone. My gf called the next day to tell them that this had happened and found out our server was actually the manager there...and he was just as rude to her about it as he was at the restaurant ...horrible place"

Our reservations were 100% successful on a busy Saturday night.  Our table was ready and waiting despite a packed house. Our open table didn&#39;t go to a walk in.  

Service was exceptional. Not too much; not too little.  We had all the water, bread, etc. that we wanted.  Our wine glasses were topped up. When we gals said no more wine (designated drivers), the waiter remembered and only the guys got vino.  We were able to take our time ordering throughout.  No rush to push us out the door after. 

The food was delicious as always.  Of special note was a filet mignon and veal meatball spaghetti topped with exceptional bolognese sauce.   It was on the specials menu and it blew one of our guests away.  The other guest had the mushroom and sausage risotto topped with goat cheese.  She said the layers of flavors and textures were amazing. 

We all loved the bread that came out with house made green olive tapenade and herbed butter.  Yummy!!!!

The only thing that gets me is the wine list is all lower range wines.  $10 wine for $40.  No midrange or better wines."

Bread awesome, wine good.  Shrimp salad was solid, steak was bland but cooked exactly as ordered.  Had sauce on side, it definitely needed it.  Lava cake was the best part of meal.

I even tried to pop in for lunch one day and that was a major fail (they only offer dinner service!). My expectations were met with solid service, an inviting atmosphere and, most importantly, pretty delicious Italian eats. 

Let me preface my review experience by stating that hubs and I made my birthday reservation here on the night of a very important Blackhawks game. We&#39;re not huge Hawks fans, but I knew the (from what I&#39;ve heard) intimate setting of this restaurant would likely be altered significantly because of said game. And while it certainly wasn&#39;t a sports bar feel, I imagine it was brighter, louder, and hosted much more TV attention than the typical Saturday night. 

All that being said, Carlos &amp; Carlos is adorably quaint. We sat practically smack dab in the middle of the restaurant and started by launching ourselves into the delicious fresh (warm) bread and garlicky whipped butter. Please and thank you. 

Our server was swift but friendly, offering his take on a variety of their Italian classics as well as some specials of the evening. We went with the scallop appetizer and since I couldn&#39;t quite make up my mind he offered to let me order halfsies on the two pastas I was mulling over. Here&#39;s a quick rundown of the dishes I tried...

Scallops Pistachio: 4/5: Three small scallops nicely seared with an awesome mango roasted pepper sauce. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the cold cauliflower &#34;hill&#34; in the middle but the main attraction (scallops) were great. 

Risotto Gamberi: 3.5/5: Arborio served w/ prawns, shaved garlic, fresh tomatoes, spinach, and touch of terragon. A solid risotto dish but I felt it could have used a kick - red pepper, heat, something. 

Gnocchi Di Casa: 5/5: Pillowy homemade gnocchi served with small chunks of fillet mignon, broccoli, shaved garlic, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms in a olive oil sauce. Fantastico. 

Veal chop: 5/5: Hubs ordered this as a special and it was pounded thin, and lightly fried to crispy but tender perfection. 

Chocolate cake: 5/5: Decadent mousse-like chocolate cake with a heavy hand (appreciated) of fresh whipped cream on top and a drizzle of raspberry. 

Apple turnover/pastry/pie: 5/5: So much cinnamon, so much apple, so much sugar. Plus ice cream. You cannot go wrong. 

I definitely want to come back to Carlos &amp; Carlos during a non-Chicago sporting event night to get the full experience...and imbibe from their famous drink cart!"

Yes, yes, yes, yes. 

Have I mentioned I like the place? It&#39;s my new favorite. It&#39;s in Downtown Arlington Heights, and it&#39;s amazing. Part of me doesn&#39;t want to share it with you. I should tell you how awful it is, so that I can keep it to myself. But it&#39;s not. Its a delicious party in your mouth that will keep you coming back for more. 

The front of the building and entry are very understated. But the inside of the restaurant is beautiful! It&#39;s very classy, but the dress-code is casual. I&#39;m sure on a  Saturday night it&#39;s probably a little nicer than &#34;casual&#34;, but i&#39;ve been twice on weeknights and we wore  jeans, and didn&#39;t feel out of place. 

They have delicious fresh bread, but that&#39;s not the best part of it. They&#39;ve got this herb/garlic butter spread that is just amazing. YUM YUM YUM. It&#39;s the kind of thing that you crave. It&#39;s the kind of thing that at 3 o&#39;clock on a Thursday you think to yourself &#34;Damn, i could go for some of that bread and butter right now&#34;. 

Rumor has it they make their own pasta on a daily basis, and I have to tell you it is just to die for. There is SUCH a HUGE difference in the pasta we all use to cook, and the fresh pasta that they use here. The texture itself even stands out.  But once you put it in your mouth, you&#39;ll never want standard pasta again. Nor should you, when something this delicious is available to you!

The first time I went, it was suggested to me to try their Spaghetti and Meatballs, even though it&#39;s not on the menu. So I did. And it was so delicious. I&#39;d literally been craving it ever since the first time I went. So I went back a couple nights ago to get it again. It&#39;s phenomenal, and I highly recommend it. 

The place is kind-of small, quaint I should say. So if they take reservations on the weekend - I&#39;d be sure to call ahead. They&#39;ve got a full bar. The service has been great. All the servers there have been very friendly and helpful. They even remembered us when we walked in after having only been there once before! The prices are very fair. 

HIGHLY recommend this place. Can&#39;t say enough good about it. I hope they are very successful and that they are here to stay."

There of course is the food and drink and there is also what I like to call the &#34;experience&#34;. Most people know if they have been served a good meal, but many times the &#34;experience&#34; is what we remember the most.

Our &#34;experience&#34; at Carlos &amp; Carlos was very enjoyable- we were greeted and seated quickly, everyone that we came in contact with smiled, seemed to be enjoying themselves and also made us feel very welcomed. It was almost like being invited to someone&#39;s home for a special occasion.

That having been said- we enjoyed everything that we ordered, but I wanted to mention two things in particular. I ordered the Linguine Pescatore which was served in a wonderful tomato-based sauce. The Linguine was cooked just the way I like it and the seafood was well done as well. Trust me if you enjoy seafood that this is a great dish to order and enjoy.

Second- we don&#39;t often order dessert, but when our server brought out the sample dessert tray, we couldn&#39;t help ourselves. There were at least a dozen lovely choices on the tray plus a number of ice creams and sherbets also. We ordered the Pistachio gelato which was more than enough to share. We both thought it was very tasty and was served with a vanilla wafer cookie.

A small thing to mention- We were seated in the back area away from the bar and the main dining area. I felt that there was more space between the tables in this area and certainly less overall activity than in the main dining space. If you are looking for a more intimate and quiet place to dine, I would suggest that you ask when checking in to be seated in this back area.

Overall we had a great meal before going to our show at the nearby Metropolis theatre; I&#39;d encourage you to give Carlos &amp; Carlos a try the next time you are looking for a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience."

We arrived without a reservation and were seated immediately. Although the menus and the wine list seemed a bit tired looking, no matter. The bread was hot and crusty. The butter perfect consistency. The olive spread just right.

The owner came by and suggested the Grigilata di Mare, which is a spectacular seafood dish with sauteed peppers and tomatoes over pasta. It was perfect. 

They provide you with a selection of complementary after dinner drinks and a selection of excellent desserts.

My spinach salad tasted like the dressing was made from chicken stock.

There were two bones in my chicken breasts in my Pollo Piccata (lemon chicken) and overall, the dish was meh.

Instead of a loaf of soft, warm Italian bread, both loaves were crunchy (inside).

Tiramisu was like a Tiramisu-flavored cake. Didn&#39;t appear to have ladyfingers. 

I really can&#39;t stand the way Carlos &amp; Carlos does their checks. 

Most restaurants will print out a white slip with the price of each item...itemized. 

At Carlos &amp; Carlos, you get the actual waiter&#39;s ticket with cash register prices in a column and not the best sense of what each price represents from your meal. 

So, best advice is to never go here if you plan on splitting a check among two or more people. Would have to be separate checks for all payers."

Recently tried this place for the first time.  We came with a party of five for a reservation on a Wednesday night based on the recommendations here on Yelp.

We made reservations early in the day and they were answered fairly promptly by e-mail and phone with responses that were almost a little over the top flowery, but nice.  

Unfortunately, once we arrived that service didn&#39;t quite hold up with a waiter who, while friendly, did not seem particularly knowledgeable or attentive.  He also seemed to have some trouble understanding even basic requests about the wine list or wanting more bread.  In addition, the restaurant was not particularly busy but the food still took quite a while to arrive.

The food itself was quite good, I had the chicken picatta which was delicately balanced without too much acidity or too much oil.  Our table also had the steak, which was perfectly cooked; the minestrone, which was also well balanced with fresh vegetables but not overloaded; and the tilapia special, which while a bit fishy for my taste was perfect for the person who ordered.

The table bread was also notably good with a perfect yeasty taste that smacked of home freshness.

For dessert we had the cannoli which was again well made.  It hit the spot for our whole table who prefer slightly less sweet desserts and a crunchy shell for a cannoli.  The only item that wasn&#39;t up to par was the carrot cake.  It had a nice dense cake body but a bizarre and terribly unappealing frosting which had the addition of garlic that just permeated in through every bite and out your nose.

Aside from the service, which may have just been our experience according to other reviews, the food really was worth the stop if you&#39;re looking for good Italian."

My husband had the Filet Mignon and I can honestly say it&#39;s the best steak you&#39;ll find in Arlington Heights. It was seasoned and cooked to perfection! I had the Gnocchi Di Casa and it was also phenomenal. Wine options were excellent and the complimentary bread and olive tapenade was a great way to start the meal.

Started off with the hostess (possibly owner/manager) telling us there probably aren&#39;t any seats outside available (without actually checking), I told her there were 2 available and she was surprised. She walked us outside and sat us down at one of the 2 available tables.... Without menus. So my fiancé and I figured the server would just come by or even bus boy with menus immediately. Nope, that&#39;s not the cause. Waited 15 minutes for menus , server came by with them.  Which then we are slowly realizing that the entire patio has only 1 server. We were handed the menus and started overlooking them. Another 10 minutes go by and the server comes back, we order the Beef Carpachio. Thankfully food arrived within the next 10 minutes... But the server? We finished the beef Carpachio and we never saw the server again. While the fiancé and I are discussing if we should even bother staying, the lady (owner/maybe manager/ hostess) grabs a glass of wine and sits with the table directly behind us. How does this woman seriously not noticed that the restaurant is backed up? Instead, she&#39;s drinking with another table. It felt like an episode where Gordon Ramsay comes out with cameras and says &#34;THIS IS WHAT YOU DONT DO&#34;, except.. Gordon never came out. Immediately when we saw this, we knew we were going to go somewhere else because that is plain ridiculous. Waited another 15 minutes for the server to come back, we told him we were done here and we would like the check. We paid the check and left and now we are next door at Magos getting 100x better service. Never again will we step foot in Carlos and Carlos."

We had a reservation for 5:00 turned out to be opening time.  When we got there we found that they had forgotten to unlock the front door. After waiting about 10 minutes I called the number on the front window and informed them of the situation.  The door was opened a little more slowly than I expected, but we got in and had our pick of tables. 

Once seated drinks and warm bread were provided.  We ordered the Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer.  It was very good.  For my entree I ordered the Black Pasta: black angel hair pasta, shrimp, scallops, red and green bell peppers, mushrooms and a delicious sauce.  She ordered Linguini Pescatore, also with shrimp and scallops, plus mussels and garlic in a marinara sauce.  As a single shared side we ordered the grilled asparagus with hollandaise; a great tasty choice.  Then we finished up with the chocolate lava volcano dessert.  Every dessert on the tray looked so good I wish we could have ordered them all.

Aside from the door hiccup at first, the service was impeccable.  We never had an empty glass or had dirty dishes hanging around the table for long. I think that every employee in the place stopped by the table at least once to take care of us (aside from the chef).  Carlos even stopped over to close the blinds since the sun was coming into my eyes and greeted me with a shoulder rub. Overall it was a great choice for our anniversary dinner, and we will definitely be going back again.

Collateral info:  The restaurant is next to a small park where concerts are hosted on Thursday and Friday nights.  It is just across the street from a free parking garage, and centrally located in downtown Arlington Heights."

Came here with a friend who lives in the area who suggested dinner at Carlos&amp;Carlos. Typically, I am not a gal who likes Italian restaurants. Perhaps it is my dislike for pasta and heavy tomato sauces? However, this place is the exception. 

The place is quaint and you would probably walk past it since there isn&#39;t a giant sign. The decor is cute and cozy. The menu isn&#39;t extensive nor is it loaded with a crazy amount of different pastas.  The waiters bring some herbed butter and an olive tapenade that is to die for! Seriously, I had to stop my self from eating all of the tapenade....it is that good! The butter you can take a pass on...but eat that tapenade!!!  

I ordered the rack of lamb and my friend ordered the talapia and pasta. The rack of lamb was more of a medium than a medium rare. However, it was delicious and juicy. I had a bite of my friend&#39;s dish, which also was pretty damn good too! The only downside is that you have a million waiters taking your orders or checking up on you.

The reason I&#39;m giving 2 stars is due to the terrible service.  I&#39;ve been here 3 times in the last 6 months, with the 3rd time being tonight.   I always come back thinking maybe this time will be different (benefit of the doubt), but tonight solidified in my mind that the service is just going to be bad forever.   Each time I&#39;ve been there there&#39;s a tense feeling in the place, largely in part to it being seemingly overbooked, and long lines of frustrated customers waiting to be seated for past-due reservations.  It is always chaotic inside (loud and overcrowded).  Sometimes when it&#39;s so busy they will try to rush you through a meal in order to get the next group seated, but this time it was unbearably slow.  We were seated for 20 minutes before we got menus (only because I had to ask for them), and we were there for over 2 hours only because it took so long to get our food.  It would have made it more bearable if someone was coming by every once in a while to refill drinks, but any time we needed anything we had to go find our waiter, or sometimes someone else if the waiter was nowhere to be seen after 5 minutes.  My advice to Carlos y Carlos is PLEASE either avoid overbooking, or hire more wait staff!   When the food is good, it&#39;s a shame for a reputation to be ruined because you feel stressed when you arrive, and when you leave."

I and two friends had a 6pm reservation on a Saturday night. My friends had eaten here once before, and had a good experience. This was a new place to me.

Arlington Heights is not exactly terra incognita for me, but it&#39;s not familiar territory either. This downtown area seems to be full of restaurants, including Carlos &amp; Carlos, which is Italian food. I did wonder why it wasn&#39;t called Carlo &amp; Carlo, which sounds more Italian to me, but hey, whatever works, right? It&#39;s not a Mexican restaurant.

The bar is on the left when you enter. It was already half full when we arrived. From the time we came in, we were very well served. They offered to take out coats. We said no, since we were three people sitting at a four-top. Someone hung my coat on the empty chair. I was last to sit down, and then he took the cloth napkin, unfolded it, and placed it on my lap. This could be because I look older than the other members of our party, though, and he wasn&#39;t sure I was capable of doing things for myself.

We had water, hot bread, and an herbed butter and an olive tapenade within 10 seconds of sitting down. The butter was fine; nothing special. I did like the olive tapenade very much. My friends dug into it too. 

The house wines by the glass were all $9. One friend had chardonnay, and I had the pinot noir. We were both very happy with our choices. The third person just ordered a Bud Light. What can I tell you - he&#39;s a nice man, so we let him come with us. 

We had the La Bella, Caprese and Roasted Beet salads. All were good. The Roasted Beet was mine, and I thought it was absolutely delicious. I&#39;d order it again in a heartbeat.

For the entrees, one friend had a special Seafood Risotto; the Bud Light man had Chicken Vesuvio; and I had the Penne Amatriciana. I thought the pasta was good, but it sure didn&#39;t wow me. Frankly, it was a disappointment. The leftovers tasted better to me for lunch the next day. The other two were very happy with their entrees.

All the pastas are made fresh in-house. When the waiter gave us the menus, he told us that everything is cooked to order, so they could accommodate any special requests. That&#39;s very nice. 

We had cappuccinos and coffee afterward. That was just fine, too. No dessert; we were too full.

This is a very popular place on Saturday night. By 6:30pm, there were at least 20 people waiting by the entrance and the bar. At least. We were patting ourselves on the back for making an early reservation.

We parked in the parking structure about a block away. Again, we were happy we&#39;d decided to come early. Three cars were jockeying for our space. Be aware that the later you come, parking might get tight here.

All in all, it was a very good experience. I would go again."

They all seem to disappear. We won&#39;t be going back.  Two dinners, soup and coffee 70.00."

Had my favorite dish of Veal Carlos-veal tenderloin &amp; mushrooms in a delicate cream sauce with a scoop of fluffy mashed potatoes and sweet cabbage. Yum! (My husband copied me so he wouldn&#39;t be jealous again.) My daughter had the black ink pasta which I can say was also delicious since she had enough leftovers for me to share the next night. My son had the special veal/beef meatballs and spaghetti and they were indeed special. Best meatballs I have ever tasted. We also shared the fritto misto appetizer and recommend that as everything was lightly breaded and fried to perfection!  Will be back again of course!

I agree that the warm bread and olive tapenade were very tasty as was the house Chianti. The grilled Calamari very tasty but there were more veggies than calamari in the dish. But still overall enjoyed it.
Now for the Main Course ....
Let me say first that I am a salt lover, and usually don&#39;t complain about it.So if I felt the food was too salty, it really was overpowering. My friend and I ordered the lobster ravioli, always one of our favorites. The presentation was lovely, however, the first bite rendered such a salty taste we both knew it wasn&#39;t an accident. The lobster filling was lost because all we could taste was salt. The other thing I noticed was that instead of a nice big fluffy pillow stuffed with the lobster and ricotta, the ravioli noodle was rather long and flat at one end ( at least three fingers width) and a small pillow at the other end. This indicated to me that they were skimping on the filling and used the extra flat part to fill you up.
My husband who eats everything and rarely complains about food offered to trade his spaghetti and meatballs for my dish, he also said it was over salted. My first taste of spaghetti sauce in comparison was not as salty as my ravioli. However, even tho the meatballs were soft and tender after a few forkfuls the Bolognese sauce (which happens to be one of my favorites) was just as salty. My conclusion?  We should have saved the 142.00."

It was a Saturday and the house was full, so make reservations. The drinks came right away, as did the delicious bread. Vegetarians and vegans beware, they serve two dips with the bread. One is obviously butter with some sort of green herb. The other looked like garlic oil, which I ate but soon realized there was fish in it. When I asked the server, he had to check (strange) and informed us that it had anchovies in it. This was a huge turn off for me and my vegetarian husband. We didn&#39;t make a huge fuss over it, but did tell the server we are vegetarian. In the future, I hope the servers tell their guests what they are placing in front of them, since it wasn&#39;t clear. 

The food didn&#39;t come out right away, which I appreciated because they were taking their time preparing quality food for us. You can watch one of the chefs making your homemade pasta! The decor is very simple and the lighting is just right. The servers were attentive, but not overly involved. Water glasses were kept full and the owner (I think) checked on us a couple times too. At the end of the meal, he brought a cart of after dinner drinks for us to enjoy on the house. Fabulous! As you walk out the door, there are cookies at the exit for you to take as you go. So many unique touches! I highly recommend this place and can&#39;t wait to return. Had it not been for eating fish on accident, I would have given it a 5+."

The mussels and clams a&#39;olio has great flavor and the sauce with the seafood I would have as soup and soak some bread in it. The lagostino ravioli is very tasty. The sauce is nice and creamy and the filling is very good. The spaghetti with meatballs is also very good. The marinara sauce is the best marinara sauce I&#39;ve ever had and the meatballs are very tender, soft, and melt in your mouth. I have had a special here once which was the shrimp diablo which is the best shrimp diablo I&#39;ve had. It was extremely spicy which I loved and the shrimp were big and perfectly cooked.

The appetizer and soup came out superfast but the main course took 30 minutes after we got our soup.  This was a common complaint amongst the other patrons.

The food was very good.  We had the escargot and calamari both of which were well done.  The calamari was cooked perfectly with a sauce that had pepperoncini peppers in it.  The black pasta with shrimp and scallops was on the spot, creamy and delicious.

Well worth a try but be prepared to wait for your main course a while."

Freshly baked bread and and some delicious spread was brought out, Then a salad came out and I gobbled that down, Then a scoop of sorbet to clean my pallet. Shortly after my main dish came and I was impressed. Every single dish was delicious and had great presentation. I&#39;m a stickler about presentation. The food was on point.

I ordered a Negroni at the bar, which was killer. For appetizers we got the stuffed eggplant and the calamari. Very good. For entrées, we ordered the classic spaghetti and meatballs and the black seafood pasta. The pasta is freshly handmade and the seafood was perfectly cooked. The meatballs melt in your mouth like butta.  Service is wonderfully friendly. We received a complimentary digestif/cordial after our meal.  And the best part? Nothing is really overpriced!

Must have been a hockey game or something because there was no discernible reason for the light crowd.

Started off with grilled calamari which was tender and flavorful. A unique combination of ingredients and just enough heat to make it interesting.

For salads we did the capresse salad. Tomatoes could have been a bit more flavorful. I guess it&#39;s tough to get good ripe tomatoes this time if year. Liked the presentation and the addition of avocado, nice touch.

Entrees were very try to the Northern Italian style you would expect, flavorful rich and creamy sauce on the veal piccata and the squid ink pasta with shrimp and scallops. Our other companion had the meatballs. I sampled one and found the blend of veal and beef very flavorful. A little rice was added to make the balls a little less dense. 

We were full so cannot comment on dessert."

As for the food, I went with a turkey carver on multigrain.  It was delicious and as with most Boston Market dishes, a bit more than I needed to eat.  The giant cups they gave us for our drink orders were daunting and I was glad I opted for lemonade instead of what might have added up to being a liter of soda otherwise.

Two things I hadn&#39;t ever seen done at a Boston Market before had to do with service.  First, after we paid for our orders, the staff brought our plates to the table of our choice.  This is nice but seems silly when we still have to fill our drinks and such.  It was almost a wasted service, if you ask me.

The prices aren&#39;t too bad, and they are pretty good about delivering on time or sooner.

The food: Well, the first time I ordered I got a chicken sandwich with fries, and an order of potato skins. The chicken sandwich was fantastic. Fries were soggy and bland. The potato skins were also soggy and lukewarm as if they were microwaved, but loaded with cheese so it somewhat made up for it.

The next time I ordered, I got a small Lieutenants BBQ pizza and....well, there no nice way to put it. It wasn&#39;t very good. The crust was soft and didn&#39;t hold, there wasn&#39;t much cheese on it, and each slice, the toppings and cheese fell off.

minghin-cuisine-rolling-meadows,Gordon G.,-1eyZGJDZRBKXCqIykNaxg,"Algonquin, IL",0,1,0,40,128,HyIIMJnggg9q8ZHc8L3Atg,5.0,2016-11-16,"I was just about to move to New York City in order to be close to the crème de la crème of Dim Sum cuisine.  My bags were packed, Diego and Juan were loading up the moving truck, and my cousin, Vincent, had his sofa all ready in his 300 sq. ft. Manhattan basement apartment for me to crash on while I searched for a place to reside in NYC for under $8,000 a month.

But then I saw a friend&#39;s review of Minghin Cuisine on Yelp, with the words 点心 &#34;dim sum&#34; highlighted, and more importantly, the city name &#34;Rolling Meadows&#34; staring me in the face.  Could this be true?  An impressive Chinese restaurant with phenomenal Dim Sum located just a short drive down Algonquin Road opened up without my knowledge? How could this be? 

Immediately, I postponed my move, in order to investigate this new discovery of the NW suburbs.  

On a Sunday afternoon, my better half and I went to Minghin to give it a try.  Now since I was in the process of relocating to Manhattan to be closer to Elizabeth Street in Chinatown, which houses such fabulous Dim Sum establishments as Oriental Garden, and Jing Fong, amongst others, Minghin would have to surpass all expectations I had built up in my head.  Before even entering, they already had two strikes against them.  1.  No cart service.  2. I would not be able to pick up &#34;Croach&#34; handbags or &#34;Rolecks&#34; watches for 12 dollars on the sidewalk outside of Minghin Cuisine.  But that&#39;s okay... flavorsome  food can certainly make up for the lack of atmosphere.

We waited 8 seconds (must&#39;ve been for good luck) before being seated at a table between the front of the restaurant and the centralized bar.  Boy those chairs are comfortable!  Given a tablet and a Dim Sum paper menu, I quickly started filling out the paper menu while the better half ordered some soup and a roast pork main dish via the tablet.  

Sadly, they were &#34;out&#34; of the roast pork dish, which seemed quite odd to me. 

About 3 minutes later, a parade of individually sized bamboo steamers showed up onto our table, housing har gow, shu mai, sticky pork filled buns, fried pork and vegetable buns, shrimp crepes, egg tarts (more on that later), potstickers, as well as a bowl of hot n sour soup.

The soup was steaming hot and strong!  Nice and spicy just the way I like it.  The really only negative with the rest of the food was that it lacked the same steaming hotness that you would normally find from steaming bamboo bowls on carts.  It didn&#39;t matter too much to me, but to some, it may.

Back to the egg tarts. This is traditionally a dish that seems to only be served to ones who have actual physical or verbal cues of Asian descent.  I have ordered egg custard every single time I dine for Dim Sum, and 90% of the time, I do not receive any.  Even while neighboring tables with Asian patrons of the restaurant are enjoying MULTIPLE orders of egg tarts!  I have seen other white folks be denied the coveted tarts as well, so it&#39;s not just me. It&#39;s all round-eye white people. However, this time was different.  My white pasty face certainly does not show any signs of me originating from Asia.  Yet, this time, at Minghin Cuisine, I was served the prized-dish.  And it was delicious!  

All of the food was spectacular, leaving me in a food coma, unable to drive home until I had hit the drive-thru of a coffee house and ordered a double.  Folks,  Minghin Cuisine could become my favorite Dim Sum restaurant of all time.   I have since cancelled my plans to relocate to The Big Apple, and will stick around the NW suburbs for awhile.  As long as Minghin Cuisine continues to serve me egg custards, I see no advantage to traveling to a major Chinatown for authentic cuisine.  

PS- We were seated at a table with Chopsticks as the only utensils.  This time, forks and extra napkins were automatically brought to our table after we ordered our food.  We had not asked for forks, but yet we received them (and I cried a little).  You know you have truly arrived as a respected connoisseur of Dim Sum (or Chinese food in general) when forks, knives, or a menu in English never makes it to your table.  I hope that will happen to me at Minghin Cuisine by New Year&#39;s Day."

The restaurant is well decorated and spacious. The wait sucked, but it seems like they get people in and out quickly even though it&#39;s busy.

The food is exactly the same as well. We ordered a little of everything on the dim sum menu. Everything came out fresh and hot. It was all so good that we ordered a second round for a couple things! It was sad that they ran out of the curry cuttlefish or Macau style pork though. We wanted to try those. My absolute favorite dim sum items are the taro puffs and custard tart and black bean pork ribs and tripe.. and this place makes them perfect. So good!!

I love how their food is not overly salty. Everything tastes simple and nice.

The service was a bit lacking... they tended to overlook our table and help tables with more guests. A couple times we had to call the server over because we either ran out of stuff or we wanted to order more. I also didn&#39;t like that one of the guys took my plate before I was done eating. None of the servers look happy... I guess that&#39;s common in asian restaurants and I guess they are very busy, but it doesn&#39;t make for a pleasant dining experience when all the servers look pissed off. 

I still gave 5 stars because I love the food here and I&#39;m so glad they FINALLY opened. We don&#39;t have to drive to Chinatown or Naperville to get dim sum anymore."

I went here with my family on a Saturday night. I recommend getting a reservation however small or large your group is because it&#39;s such a popular spot. 

Our wait time for our food wasn&#39;t that long. Dim sum we enjoyed: short rib with honey sauce, shrimp dumpling, the crepes, and bbq pork bun. Dim sum we wouldn&#39;t order again: siu mai, and stuffed sticky rice in lotus leaf. We also ordered from the dinner menu and wasn&#39;t disappointed with the amount of each dish they gave us. However, they ran out of roast pork belly by 7pm, which looked really good on the menu! 
For sweets, some ordered mango freezes and those were delicious. It was served in a cup with small, clear tapioca. Others ordered taro, mango, honeydew, and avocado smoothies with tapioca, which were not all that great. They were all too sweet and too icy."

Fortunately, they take reservations of groups of 6 or more, as the large place was totally packed and with maybe 20 people waiting at the reception area at 7pm on a Saturday night.  Virtually all of the diners looked to be Chinese, which surprised me a little in that there was not a little more diversity at this suburban location.  I would say our dining experience was more like 4.5 stars though.  The food was all top notch except maybe the cage-free chicken dish which was a bit on scrawny side, and the average tasting pea tips in broth.  The ratings drawback is due to the space being so loud when it&#39;s packed - it&#39;s like dining in a loud bar, and one could not have a conversation without some extra effort. Anyway, our dinner entrees for tonight were:

- Minghin cage-free half-chicken (scrawny as mentioned)
- clams Hong Kong style (a nice spice level from the jalapenos and red peppers)
- salt and pepper soft shell crab (great dish and value at $15.95)
- beef brisket with eggplant (a tasty and somewhat unique offering, and great with white rice)
- Nagaimo yam gingko shrimp
- pea tips in broth (a little on bitter side, and so-so)
- jumbo sesame balls (served hot, and delicious and addictive)

Overall, still high on my list of Chinese dinner places, but I might try to avoid peak traffic periods.

ps - they had one TV by the bar showing the depressing (for Cubs nation) WS Game 4 going-ons, and other TV&#39;s in the dining area were static with Chinese TV station menus, so they don&#39;t cater to a sports minded audience anyway."

Minghin has mitigated the mystery underneath each metal lid by making it super easy to order dim sum. 

Minghin is one of the top restaurants in Chinatown and they just opened their fourth location in Rolling Meadows. They&#39;ve invested quite a bit of money on the interior because the place is pretty swanky. From the old days, dim sum consisted of carts full of metal tin containers. Unless you knew the name of the dish in Chinese, you were often stuck with asking the wait staff to lift each lid. You also weren&#39;t sure how long the food had been left on the carts. The great thing about Minghin is that you can order dim sum from the convenience of a menu or a tablet with photos and the food isn&#39;t lukewarm .  

Indicators of good dim sum are the quality of ingredients used, variety of options, and the temperature of the food. Minghin delivers in each category. Still not sure what to order? Get a variety of items that are steamed, braised, pan or deep fried, and a mixture of savory and sweet dishes. Dim sum is offered all day and it&#39;s 20% off Monday through Friday from 2:30-5pm."

After OCB rolled out, there has been a steady stream of subpar buffets and other random restaurants trying to set up shop here. But Minghin has good service, great food, is fancy and fun inside and on top of it all, has the Minghin name we&#39;ve all come to love from Chinatown right in Arlington Heights! Woohoo!

My coworkers and I went during lunch to try their daily dim sum. Yea huh, you read that right! Daily dim sum in the &#39;burbs! Don&#39;t expect the carts rolling around that you can grab your goodies straight from. Instead they have a photo menu on which you check which dim sum items you want. Everything we ordered was bigger than expected, decently priced and came out quite fast.
+Spare Ribs with Black Bean Sauce - some pieces had little meat on them and I was gnawing on bones. Overall though, a good dish, tasty sauce, but I&#39;d probably skip it my next go around.
+Pan Fried Vegetable Roll - meh. Skip this. Nothing amazing.
+BBQ Pork Crepe - The meat was good though not plentiful. I liked the crepe a lot but there was soooo much of it folded over. I just had huge bites of dough at times. Don&#39;t get me wrong it was sticky &amp; wonderful dough ---- but I need some meat with my sticky icky.
+Egg Tarts! My loves. I love these little custard pastries and they were just as good here as I&#39;ve had anywhere else and served warm.

They were out of pork belly the day I went! Oh so sad. Aside from the dim sum, we split an Orange Beef entree dish that was so delicious. Seriously it was so tasty I couldn&#39;t stop taking just &#39;one last piece&#39;. We wished for a bit more crispiness to bring it to perfection, but I gotta say it was pretty close to a perfect ten dish even without that.

I&#39;ll be back a million more times to try a million more dishes I&#39;m sure. It&#39;s going to be hard not ordering that Orange Beef though....Man is it tasty!"

Waited 30 minutes for a table (it was packed on a Sunday night,) and the seating area was plentiful. There are menus up at the front, so we were productive in that time and had our order ready by the time we sat down.

There&#39;s a tablet with an expanded menu (non-dim sum) at each table, but it was a little too complicated for us, so we stuck to dim sum. Bubble tea is also offered, but I don&#39;t recall it on the menu. 

The food came out quick and in reasonable intervals. It was just as good if not better than the Chinatown location without the grimy feel of most restaurants in that area. Service was also pretty quick. Usually hot tea is automatically served, but we had to ask for it, and it never came. 

Food was hot and fresh, but some of my friends commented some items lacked flavor. I just use Sriracha to take care of that, so seasoning was a non-issue for me. 

I&#39;d just keep in mind to order a variety of textures. We ordered crepes, and it came with the &#34;beef with soy sauce noodles,&#34; which were rice noodles, and everything at the point was a bit too gelatinous for me. All-in-all, I&#39;d return to get my dim sum fix whilst in the area again. For regular Chinese, I&#39;d go to Chef Ping down the street."
minghin-cuisine-rolling-meadows,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,"Buffalo Grove, IL",1,1,1,389,13,FzFw3zV5qUyFo2XAOmg2Yw,5.0,2016-09-25,"Foodies around the Palatine -Rolling Meadows - Arlington Heights - Schaumburg area have been waiting patiently for this famous local Michelin Recommend (Big Gourmand) restaurant to open. In the northwest suburbs, if you&#39;re lucky enough to find dim sum, it&#39;s generally very pricey and only mediocre in quality. Even if you head further down to Westmont or Schaumburg, the quality of dim sum you&#39;ll get is nothing to write home about.

So, does the new Ming Hin live up to the expectations and have the same great quality as the other branches? The answer is a resounding &#34;YES!&#34;. Like the other Ming Hin locations, there are some signature things you&#39;ll definitely notice. The restaurants are very spacious with upscale decor, plenty of servers, well lit, and plenty of parking -- with decorations that are sure to impress your friends. 

But, most importantly -- how is the food? The food comes out piping hot and beautifully presented. There are plenty of dim sum options (more than any other local Chinese restaurant by a mile) with plenty of protein and vegetable variations (don&#39;t forget about their delicious bao and desserts as well!). If you have not eaten much dim sum before -- there are some points to note. First, the portion sizes are a bit smaller and priced as such -- like Chinese tapas. Second, you will find much less sauces than you&#39;d expect from Chinese food. The flavor relies on the freshness and natural quality of the ingredients and avoiding the use of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and oils shows the confidence they have in their ingredient quality. Although the size of the dishes are smaller, using high quality ingredients allows them to pack a ton of flavor into each bite. Third, the dishes will in general be a bit less sweet and salty, while demonstrating a higher level of cooking technique. This is preferred in finer dining -- where fresh spices and herbs provide the majority of the flavor instead. Fourth - Bring friends. Dishes are meant to be shared and you&#39;ll want to try a bit of everything.

Like other Ming Hin restaurants - make sure you try the shrimp crepe, beef crepe, siu mai, beef balls, ** fresh bao **, and bbq pork turnover. The food is pretty consistently between good and excellent for any dish you order so be adventurous and prepare to be delighted."

They have a huge presence in Chinatown and now their plan is to branch out to the burbs. Their doors opened in a remodeled building that used to be a Chinese buffet. There&#39;s plenty of room (unlike its original location) and pretty Chinese decor. 

It feels like Chinatown too. I had no idea there were so many in Arlington Heights. Or are they just flocking here for the first few months. 

My hope is that they do not follow the Chinese buffet trend of putting their best foot forward only to go back into their ways a few months later that detracts customers and will flop in a matter of a year. 

Food is food. It&#39;s noisy. Feels too sophisticated. Suburban families will not get it. Chinese tv on will be confusing for those not used to the Chinatown scene. 

I don&#39;t know how I feel about this place. 

I suppose if you want Chinese food this is nice. But maybe I&#39;m just old fashioned. I don&#39;t want Chinatown in the suburbs. I&#39;ll just take a walk to the Panda Express I see through the window."

1. BBQ pork puffs were crispy, warm enough and delicious!
2. Fried dumplings were crispy with soft mochi wrap. However, they were very greasy and didn&#39;t have enough filling.
3. Turnip cakes were flavorful! I wish they would pan fry those a bit more so they don&#39;t fall apart that easily.
4. Pan fried buns were okay. Not the best I have ever had, but certainly edible. The bun itself was light and soft, I wish they could be more juicy inside and with saltier filling.
5. Stir fried sticky rice was the worst dish we got at this meal. They were very bland and parts of the rice were still pale. Will never get this again!
6. Roast pork was okay. The skin was kinda hard but I absolutely loved how fat and tender the meat was!!
7. Roast duck was okay. I like the sauce but the duck skin was not crispy at all. The meat was good though.

The interior was very nice and the service was pleasant too! The food came very quickly and they took away our empty plates very fast. They came to check if we had enough tea so often that we didn&#39;t even have to ask for more hot tea while we were there!
We will be back to try more stuff on the menu!"

I am excited beyond words that they opened a location even closer to me.  Expect me to be there once a week now...not even kidding. This is in a strip mall but that doesn&#39;t take away from the ambiance of the place.  It is more of a luxurious/upscale type of dim sum restaurant and the décor feels classier than your usual Chinese restaurants.  This is a chain and I&#39;ve only been to the Chinatown location until now but the food is just as delicious.  You can order dim sum anytime of the day which is amazing!  I recommend coming here for their dim sum or pan fried noodles with beef.  You can&#39;t go wrong with anything you order here but some of my dim sum favorites are the siu mai, shrimp dumplings, pan fried turnip cake, beef crepe, and the pan fried green chive cake.  Also, this location is fancy when it comes to takeout orders you place there; they give you a tablet where you place your order by selecting the items you want and adding them to your virtual shopping cart.  Ooooh!"

Count me in!  Our first experience was so good we came back 3 days later.  We repeated some of the DimSum and tried some new items.  Everything was as good if not better the second time around.  The service is excellent.  I am ok with chop sticks and sushi but terrible using them with slippery steamed shrimp dumplings or shrimp crepes.  The Manager brought me a knife and fork without my having to ask last time. Delivered stealth mode with a friendly wink.  I dig that dude.  Today, they remembered me and the fork and knife were there for my husband and I as soon as we sat down. I like that they remembered us.  Sure, we are nice and tip well but still...it&#39;s nice to have our needs anticipated and to be remembered.  We haven&#39;t had room for dessert yet but I vow to next time.  

Last but not least...we got there early today (4 pm) and found out that they offer a 20% discount from 2:30 pm to 5 pm.  The discount was on DimSum, entrees AND our beer!!!!!!

Did I say I LOVE this place?"

My friend and I went, we ordered the usual what we would get at the China location. Everything was hot and fresh. Unfortunately they ran out of BBQ pork buns and the sesame buns had white bean instead of the usual red. For a Sunday 11ish am we only waited about 15min for a table for 2. There were obviously larger parties waiting longer. If you want to step outside the dim sum menu- go for the Singapore vermicelli noodles. This place does them the best. For $9 you get such a huge portion, can easily be split amongst like 6 people. Oh and the bubble tea here is awesome too!"

I did not know they were opening a location nearby! My family loves the location downtown, but rarely go due to the relatively long drive on a busy morning. I am very happy to see them growing and opening more locations though!

The interior was clean and very upscale in appearance. I was able to snag a table late afternoon, but was in a hurry. They were able to get the food out quickly without loss in quality.

I ordered a relatively light amount. The pork and shrimp (siu mai) was really good! As was the Custard Bun and Sticky Rice. The shrimp spring rolls were good, but slightly overdone. Possibly due to my request for speedy service? Either way, this locations definitely delivers in overall taste. The servers were awesome as well. 

Prices seem consistent between the two. I can&#39;t remember the exact amounts at the China Town location. Overall, great place and a welcomed addition!"

We made a reservation online which I got an email confirmation for and if I hadn&#39;t called to confirm, we would&#39;ve never known that they canceled it, without informing us. The lady who picked up the phone said, &#34;you made a reservation at 5:14 and it&#39;s now 5:46 and I just checked the email, I&#39;m sorry. We cannot take reservations less than two hours.&#34; I said, well then why was it available online for me to make a reservation?!?! She kept apologizing and asked me how she can make it better and I told her she can make it better by keeping my reservation. She then replies and says, I can&#39;t do that. What was the point of asking me?! The manager kept saying, &#34;I&#39;ll talk to my computer guy.&#34; Pointless and ineffective.

Anyway, we had to scramble to find a place that would take a group of 13, what an inconvenience. A good business would have taken our reservation and made it work."

When the big day arrived, my company and I tried out some dim sum and ordered our respective dinner entrees. All of it was terrible. To start with, we were unimpressed with the chive/shrimp dumplings- the dough was barely holding together, a mass of goop (there&#39;s no other way to describe it) lumped around filling that smelled awful. It didn&#39;t even smell like seafood; I don&#39;t even know how to describe it. They brought our vegetable crepes next. Perhaps it was the least offensive dish, since it tasted like absolutely nothing, failing to even absorb the flavor of the sauce it came with. 

Still, I had hope. Everything rode on my main meal, the beef with broccoli... and my hope crashed and burned. I knew from the moment I bit into it that the stuff was very fatty, low quality, and too soft from too much tenderizer. I refused to touch another piece and had to satisfy myself with all the broccoli it came with just to satisfy my appetite. I also shared a bit of my companion&#39;s chow mein... and returned to my broccoli when that too turned out to be bad. It didn&#39;t taste different than any chow mein you can get from a sketchy second rate Chinese restaurant, and this place was recognized by Zagat and Michelin? Apparently, some people don&#39;t know taste."

Dim sum were made to order, fresh, steamy &amp; delicious.  Between the two visits, we have ordered more than half of the dim sum on the menu.

However, our dinner experience was quite different.  We ordered General Tso chicken, Kung pao beef, mixed seafood on a nest, stir fry mixed vegetable with garlic, fried rice and a few dim sum (cause they serve dim sum all day).  The dinner dishes were ok, not as good as their dim sum.  The mixed seafood was a little bland, the deep fried nest was not crispy, kung pao beef was not spicy at all and the stir fry vegetables has no garlic flavor.  Service was not good, the waitress might be inexperienced.  It took her a long time to serve us tea (she might have forgotten), she also screwed up on our wine order (gave us different kind of wine), we have to ask twice before we got fork &amp; knife, etc.

Although it may be one of the 2 go-to places for dim sum, diners need to be aware that their lotus rice is much smaller than other places and their egg tarts are overwhelmingly soaked with meat fat. I can taste the fat. An alternative good dim sum place is on Miner Street in Arlington Heights. Their double cooked pork is a waste of money and they do use a lot of filler vegetables and eggplants in their chicken eggplant dish, They still have some ways to go."

The food was very good, and not as salty as some of the places I&#39;m used to patronizing in the city.  Dim sum starts at $3.50 per dish, vs $3 downtown, but the dumplings are all large and full of meat and veggies, so you&#39;re definitely getting your money&#39;s worth.  It&#39;s easy to order too much and have to take it home.  However, too much food is a much better problem to have than not enough food.

The only reason I&#39;m giving this place 4 stars is that there&#39;s a lot of empty space in the dining areas.  Since you actually order from a menu and they bring the food to you, rather than pushing carts like traditionally occurs downtown, they could probably find a way to fit more tables in the dining room to help cut down on the hour long wait.  I know part of that was the demand at 12:00 on a Sunday, but I heard about 15 groups called ahead of mine where they left the restaurant rather than wait.  They could cut down on reneging with more tables, since they don&#39;t need to make room for carts to maneuver.

All in all, expect good food, plenty of it, and expect to wait for a table between 11am and 2pm on a weekend."

The interior design is very elegant, they put alot of effort into making it a classy dining experience. I like how it&#39;s bright and spacious, very pleasant ambiance, which is usually lacking in the Asian dining experience.
 Now for the food...classic dim sum dishes with depth, like the sixth taste bud, the umami. All of the food was served HOT and was brought out as it was made. The hot and sour large order was JUMBO. Very generous portions of all dishes and service was attentive. It was great to just walk in today and get a table, I have a feeling that in the future, the line will be out the door.

The food was tasty and the food came pretty fast even during its busy hour. However I found the dim sum to be overpriced. The service I had was great. Be careful though because it seems like they try to get your tip even if they&#39;re not the ones who serve you.

The decor inside the restaurant looked very stylish and elegant, they did a nice job with the interior designs. Plenty of seating. Price-wise, it was just a little tad higher than I like, but the food, experience and service made it worth it.  I hope that they will maintain the quality of service since this restaurant here is still quite new."

Although it may be one of the 2 go-to places for dim sum, diners need to be aware that their lotus rice is much smaller than other places and their egg tarts are overwhelmingly soaked with meat fat. I can taste the fat. An alternative good dim sum place is on Miner Street in Arlington Heights. Their double cooked pork is a waste of money and they do use a lot of filler vegetables and eggplants in their chicken eggplant dish, They still have some ways to go."

The food was very good, and not as salty as some of the places I&#39;m used to patronizing in the city.  Dim sum starts at $3.50 per dish, vs $3 downtown, but the dumplings are all large and full of meat and veggies, so you&#39;re definitely getting your money&#39;s worth.  It&#39;s easy to order too much and have to take it home.  However, too much food is a much better problem to have than not enough food.

The only reason I&#39;m giving this place 4 stars is that there&#39;s a lot of empty space in the dining areas.  Since you actually order from a menu and they bring the food to you, rather than pushing carts like traditionally occurs downtown, they could probably find a way to fit more tables in the dining room to help cut down on the hour long wait.  I know part of that was the demand at 12:00 on a Sunday, but I heard about 15 groups called ahead of mine where they left the restaurant rather than wait.  They could cut down on reneging with more tables, since they don&#39;t need to make room for carts to maneuver.

All in all, expect good food, plenty of it, and expect to wait for a table between 11am and 2pm on a weekend."

I&#39;m sure by this weekend, this place will be packed to the gills. DIM SUM ALL DAY! Ordered a variety of dim sum dishes, fried rice, hot and sour soup, and steamed shrimp. The interior design is very elegant, they put alot of effort into making it a classy dining experience. I like how it&#39;s bright and spacious, very pleasant ambiance, which is usually lacking in the Asian dining experience.
 Now for the food...classic dim sum dishes with depth, like the sixth taste bud, the umami. All of the food was served HOT and was brought out as it was made. The hot and sour large order was JUMBO. Very generous portions of all dishes and service was attentive. It was great to just walk in today and get a table, I have a feeling that in the future, the line will be out the door. If you are curious, check it out before the weekend crowd. I will definitely be back (have to get on a more rigorous workout plan now)."

We had great hopes, the menu online looked wonderful. Our party consisted of 3 adults, a teenager, and two toddlers. We had all pretty much decided what to order from the web, and we were really looking forward to lunch today. However, the menu online is not the restaurants menu. Not at all. So the things that looked exciting we thought of ordering were not on the menu anymore.

We arrived at noon, and were the only people in the restaurant.  As a matter of fact, my husband and I wandered around for well over 5 minutes before the bartender appeared. We sat down, our daughter and three kids arrived shortly after. We were pleasantly surprised with the interior. So far, I was very happy!

We decided to order chicken fingers for the 3 and 4 year old immediately, and then we ordered our food. The chicken took about 15 minutes. We had ordered one burger, one soup of the day, one chicken sandwich, and one turkey sandwich. oh and the fried pickles.

The bartender/server said they had a tomato soup today, and left over chicken soup from yesterday. I asked if it was broth based, and she said she was pretty sure it was, but would let me know. She brought the soup out, and as she handed it to me, said it&#39;s cream based. fine, whatever. I tasted the soup, which had more sage in it that the average Thanksgiving turkey and stuffing. It was completely inedible.

When the she came to clear dishes, she asked how my still full cup of soup was, and i said not good. She said thanks for letting me know, I won&#39;t order it later.

The rest of the food took almost an hour to come out. An hour after the chicken fingers is a really long time. At this point there was another couple, and a few people in the booth behind us. My husband was seriously going to ask for the check so we could find someplace else to have some food..we should have.

 The burger was ordered &#34;pink&#34;, as my husband was asked if he wanted it pink. It was very well done. The bacon tasted old and nasty. The chicken on the sandwich was completely over cooked.

The fried pickles were truly horrible. And i mean horrible. They were cold and soggy. They tasted like very old oil. Unbelievably bad. I ate one, the 13 yo ate half and the rest sat. Since my lunch consisted of fried pickles and soup, I was pretty hungry when we left. And during all of this we lost the bartender/server. Someone else dropped the food, and we never saw her again until she brought the check.

This was a huge disappointment, and I will never go back. The humorous part was when the bartender dropped the check, she asked if we had a frequent diners card. Not a chance!! There&#39;s $70 it pained me to have spent on something so miserable."

They have room for banquets.

The bar is incredible... literally... it is hand-made on-sight decked out with ornamented trim and leaded glass windows through out. Looks and feels like Ireland.

My wife noticed 3 bugs floating atop the glass and that immediately drew my attention. I notified the bartender when she asked me how it was. We debated leaving but decided to stay for our app and leave after. When the app came I looked down at my plate and noticed 7 bugs crawling on the bar top and on my napkin and plate.

Our group ordered a sampling of many tasty tacos and all tried the different margaritas. I had the organic slim margarita and was happy with my choice. 

One other note if you are coming with a group. Because they have a large space, they are able to handle the larger groups pretty easily. This really is great, especially on a Friday or Saturday night."

We made reservations which were honored and good. But service was ok. We are vegetarians so there wasnt much on the menu to order from. But what i was highly recommending was the quesadillas. They were NOTHING like when i had em the 1st time. 1st time they were spilling out with veggies and cheese. This time i barely saw couple veggies inside...mostly cold melted cheese. My gf ordered the carne tacos BUT w/o the carne....because we dont eat meat. Boy that was a foreign concept to our server. She even made comments to the fact that the kitchen staff were laughing and suprised that someone ordered carne tacos without the meat.... :-(
Well after waiting almost 20-25 min we had to ask our server to cancel our order coz it was getting soo late...and she declined our request by saying that they had already made it.....so......where the heck was our food then?!
She goes back...5 or min later...brings out our food. Boy what a dissappointment it was. My gf&#39;s tacos had cheese and verde sauce...no avacado salsa or caramalized onions as stated in menu! And when we pointed it out to our server.....we were again looked at like we were crazy to point that out?! 
Im sorry to have gone there tonight....and more sorry to have spent almost $90 on sucky food (drinks were ok too....1st margarita was good but the 2nd one tasted watered down)....and unprofessional service...we could not wait to leave. Fyi....we still left a tip just coz she did still serve us...
The only good thing bout food was the corn tortillas....they were still good...everything else...ehh...
Wont be coming back anytime soon....

It took almost 30 minutes to even put our order our food took so long that we were all full on chips and guac before our dinners even came that we didn&#39;t even want to eat them. Food was good, I wish I was less full to enjoy it! 

It was very difficult to get our servers attention all night. He seemed to have tables all over the restaurant (even outside) as well as our party of 14. It was frustrating because the restaurant wasn&#39;t even busy. 

My husband liked the food and he is a hard man to please, so hopefully our next experience is better."

Our waiter was attentive, but they got too busy for the size of the restaurant and so the service became slow. The space is very long and they are understaffed to support the length of the space. There was an error in our order that was quickly corrected. I have issue with restaurants that take the time to describe their food on the menu, listing the ingredients and then choose to garnish with cheese, that is not listed in the ingredients. Many people, not just me, have an allergy to dairy.  If you&#39;re going to top with cheese, list it.  Overall, less than stellar, not likely to return. I could see it being popular for the bar, more than the restaurant."

We quickly ordered, not to lose her. We never saw her again until we got the check (everything else was done by the food runner... He delivered our food and also got us a drink refill...

Had the kids with and it was busy, but not anything abnormal for a fair weekend on Saturday night. So be prepared, right? Received salsa before chips. Never given a kid&#39;s drink that was included in the food price. Kid&#39;s plain quesadilla with fries took longer than our dinners (which wasn&#39;t helpful when the server specifically asked if we wanted it first. YES. yes we do). Fajitas weren&#39;t served with the corn tortillas... just had to stare at the for awhile until they arrived.

All that to say, the food was solid good. Not amazing. It would taste similar if I made it at home, but it was tasty. Forty bucks later and we were all fed and happy, so it was a-ok."

By the time we left, the patio tables were full...we were alone inside the whole time. 

We opted for the Piña Guacamole. It was good. BT wins the guac race, but the bean dip and chips go to Puebla. We loved both. 
We didn&#39;t have a cocktail, but I do want to go back and try their creative margaritas for sure. We had water, and let me tell you, it was awesome water. Super cold, no ice needed...a very nice perk. So yes, we were sort of boring on this trip, our son was at a birthday party and we wanted to get in and get out, so it was water, guac and tacos. So let&#39;s get to the best part, the tacos! We ordered the carne and pescado. The carne are steak, and super tasty steak at that. They are topped with delicious caramelized onions, an avocado sauce and cheese. The pescado tacos were grilled Mahi Mahi, we were so impressed with them. They has a pico de gallo type topping and avocado. They were the best tacos I&#39;ve ever had.

I had the special of the day: their award winning chicken, bacon and chorizo tacos - out of this world!

We had been talking about it for months! Unfortunately our experience didn&#39;t live up to our expectations. We were immediately served chips and beans, and the entire bowl of chips was crumbs and small broken chip pieces (no exaggeration). We tried to eat them anyway, but they were SO insanely greasy that both of us instantly felt terribly sick. I&#39;ve never had this problem (not even at Taco Bell.) We both moved on and ordered margaritas, and when we received them, the SIDES of the glasses were salted, not the rim. Like, what? Since when is that a thing? In addition, they were 80% ice, 10% margarita mix, and 5% alcohol. Basically tasted like juice. 

Our entrees were loaded with grease, tasted like they had no salt whatsoever, and were really small portions for the price. I have honestly never had such bland Mexican food in my entire life. You&#39;ve really got to go out of your way to mess up enchiladas in my opinion. They aren&#39;t rocket science. 

We threw our boxed up &#34;leftovers&#34; in the trash as soon as we left. We spent the rest of our night feeling nauseous and miserable. We will not return."

I am from California, so I dearly miss authentic Mexican food. I have found that this place is the only place in the close vicinity that has good Mexican food.

Where to start? The Guacamole is DELICOUS. The Chips &amp; Salsa are amazing (even though you have to pay for them). The Elote is to die for, and you can&#39;t beat the Carne Asada Tacos. This is just the beginning. I&#39;m sure that the rest of the menu is very good as well, these items are just, so good that I don&#39;t want to get anything else. 

I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the margaritas. I though they were a little small for the price, and a bit watered down. On the other hand, my wife thought that they were pretty good. I don&#39;t typically get alcohol anyways, so I won&#39;t be too harsh in this area.

Service has been hit or miss, but I come back for the food every time!

I did buy the guac (traditional) and Rojo salsa - again just ok, nothing special. Will probably try to find something else for Mexican. Evidently they have complimentary bean dip that&#39;s great, wasn&#39;t offered any so I wouldn&#39;t know.

Some friends suggested this place for dinner this weekend and not knowing much about it, I went with the crowd and made out way to this perfect dinner spot. First impression: spacious, clean, excellent lighting, great location, and the employees seemed to be on top of their game.

When we arrived, we were a few minutes late so we found some margaritas already on our table our friends had ordered. Unfortunately, when I drink tequila, bad things seem to happen so after briefly browsing the menu, I went with a ginger ale and the hubby ordered a Mexican Sprite in the glass bottle. If you have had an America Sprite, you will know the difference!!

Their house made chips were served with beans instead of salsa which I thought was a nice touch. I ordered a few salsas off the menu to try. 3 types for $5. I ordered the Salsa Verde, Habanero and Chile de Arbol. Not gonna lie, one was better than the next. I could have eaten all 3 and made a meal out of them! some of the best salsas are the ones you would never try. Take it from the Mexican that doesn&#39;t like spicy food all that much!!

Their orders of tacos are about $10-$12 for four tacos. At first, I wanted to order the Al Pastor because this is the true test for a Mexican place as far as I&#39;m concerned but after hearing about their specials, I changed my order to their taco of the day: barbacoa. They do not allow you to mix up your taco orders so you must get all 4 the same. You are best to find someone to order something else and trade some tacos to get a variety! Hubbs ordered the steak tacos with melted cheese and I chose the special Barbacoa taco dinner. Rice is not included but it did not interest me all that much. The 4 tacos are more than enough for one person. 

Service is where they lose a star. Our server was very nice and knew the menu items, FOR SURE!! However, we found ourselves quite often with empty drinks or water and even after finding our server and asking for this drink or that drink, he still took a while to produce a beverage. This seemed to be just how the night went for beginning to end. Otherwise, everything went well. The empty glasses issue needs to addressed but we will be back. 

The food and pricing was very appealing and I can&#39;t wait to go back to try the guacamole!!"

Went here when it first opened on a Saturday at 11:30.  Seated promptly.  Let&#39;s just say service was generally good.  Food was definitely mixed.  Prices a little high.

I get that this place is similar to many in the area - tapas style tacos.  BienTrucha, Lupitas, Macarena, El Molcajete, Altiro.  Bien Trucha 5* is the best, Altiro close with 4*.  The rest...decent, but not at the same price point.

We got the ceviche for an appetizer.  It was probably 50% tomatoes, 40% fish and 10% avocados.  Definitely not worth the $11-12 price (I forget exactly).  Fish was chopped in large chunks.  Needed a better ratio (more fish) and smaller chunks of fish.

Tacos - asada, camaron and the chicken-bacon-chorizo one.  The tortillas weren&#39;t toasted or anything.  They were soft, but not warm or heated to bring out the great corn flavor of corn tortillas.  None came out hot.  The camaron (fried shrimp) were not crispy.  The chicken-chorizo-bacon was fairly spicy (observation, not complaint).  The chicken was precooked and dry, the chorizo and bacon flavors barely there.  The asada had an excellent charred flavor, this was the best.  But still, tortillas plain and tacos served almost room temp.  

The child meal was ok for $7.  Kind of meager in portion.  The corn is not fresh, probably frozen.  The ice cream that came with the kid&#39;s meal (vanilla) was delicious, from a gelato place and the server raved about it.  Since it was lunch, we didn&#39;t get any alcoholic drinks, so can&#39;t speak to that.  My water was served with no ice, and my lemon was never refreshed despite the fact my drink was &#39;water with lemon.&#39;  At noon on a Saturday, it was nearly empty, ad therefore ok for a 3 year old, and she was well behaved.

The place was clean, well staffed, good atmosphere, good music.  The only negative besides the food was the high ceiling makes it very echoy when empty (when you have a 3 year old saying hi to passers by outside the window we were seated next to), guessing it gets quite loud when full.  Also, it was freezing inside.  Felt like 65 degrees!  We were shivering.

The courtyard outside is very refreshing.  Met a couple who mentioned the other 3 restaurants were their favorite and they basically agreed with us about our Puebla experience.  We won&#39;t be going back until we try Neo, McNallys and Zaza."

Unfortunately, good looks can only take you so far, and that is certainly the case with Puebla.

My girlfriend and I met here for dinner last week, and were surprised to see how uncrowded the restaurant was, even for a weeknight, though in hindsight, that probably should have been a sign. We ordered two cocktails, and I must say they were very nice, so if you&#39;re just coming for drinks, you might enjoy the place.

We, however, were also ordering food, especially since chips and salsa did not come complimentary (really? A Mexican restaurant that doesn&#39;t give you free chips and salsa?). We ordered one of the rather expensive salsas, as well as the house guacamole. It was crystal clear that the guacamole was previously frozen - in fact, parts of it were still frozen when it hit the table! We left most of it untouched, something I do not think I have ever done at a Mexican restaurant.

At the waiter&#39;s suggestion, I ordered the fish tacos, expecting crispy tilapia with fresh cilantro and avocado. What arrived instead were four slabs of fish (literally, the fish was cubed) without the slightest crispiness whatsoever. If there was fresh cilantro on those tacos it must have been invisible to the naked eye, as I certainly couldn&#39;t spot any. I left two of the tacos untouched as well.

For a meal that cost each of us $46, my friend and I left very hungry and unhappy. I don&#39;t expect Puebla to last long."

I asked if they anticipate being very crowded and she said something to the effect that that&#39;s why they are only taking taking reservations for 20 or more.  I asked if since we are only 4 people should we just plan on NOT coming and she said YES!!!!!
Come on, you&#39;re a business and you say you&#39;re open on Easter but don&#39;t come.

Not to worry, NEVER will.  

I don&#39;t anticipate this restaurant being in business long."

I am pretty picky about my mexican food. To the extreme that I will go to the same restaurant several times because I am too nervous to get bad mexican food but this place was FANTASTIC. I ordered the tacos and they came with this amazing sauce in a flight of about 4 or 5 small flour tortillas. I also ordered the corn and let me tell you, this was my favorite! I was so excited to see this on the menu! It is rather large so my friend and I shared. They also do have a house tequila that is pretty good and if you go on a Monday they have half off of their margarita drinks with their house tequila. They also have a bean dip with homemade tortilla chips to munch on while you wait. It is a little pricey but I will definitely come again!"

The restaurant was not busy at all.  It took a half hour to get guacamole for the chips.  There were 5 of us and twice when we ordered drinks, the waiter brought only 4 and we had to keep asking for the 5th.  When we got our dinner, only 4 dinners arrived and only after we got a woman who was either the manager or owner involved, did we get the 5th dinner.  We were in a hurry to make a show and our waiter just took his time and did not seem concerned.  I asked for limes in my drink and had to ask twice to get those as well."

We went around 1 pm on a Saturday and it was fairly quiet. We were greeted immediately and seated in a booth (we were offered either booth or table). I had a delicious margarita to start- pineapple and had a nice peppery kick- loved it. I enjoyed the fish tacos which were perfectly cooked and seasoned and also had a lovely dessert in the warm brown sugar cake (which really looked more like a muffin- but still delicious). I thought the prices were comparable to other restaurants of the same caliber and I would definitely come back to try some of their other food in the future. Good food and good service with a nice ambiance- what more can you ask?

My wife ordered the Scallops Y Chorizo which and were the worst she has ever had at any restaurant! Server asked how our food was and then removed the plate after telling her the scallops were so fishy tasting that she could not eat. In fairness the server asked if she could get something else but by this time my wife&#39;s appetite was ruined. I had the pastor tacos which tasted average but served at room temperature. We overheard two other tables being offered apologies for some problem during their dining experience.
 
After we were done the server brought us the check and still charged us for the full plate of scallops that were returned to the kitchen as inedible . Paid the check and have decided to cut our losses with this restaurant as there are many others that are much better. Puebla has a decent atmosphere but I would only recommend that you want chips and salsa."

What a great idea! They start with crisp chips and a smooth bean dip. The jalapeño and salsa verde were excellent. We then had baja tacos and chicken tinga tacos. The ingredients were fresh and the flavors well balanced. This is a fresh take on traditional Mexican cuisine with a healthier option using lettuce wraps. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with the menu options. The place was about half full and a little noisy so I&#39;m not sure how it would be with a full bar and tables.

Total disappointment!!! Our server was okay, underage to serve alcohol, and the bartender was working as a server too... We ask for michelada, no ice, well came to the table with ice after a long time waiting,  I asked  to have it fix , the bartender or server, didn&#39;t care,  the drink took forever,  and he &#34;fixed it&#34; by removing the ice and adding  extra Clamato , if I recalled right I never order tomato juice.  The fish tacos were warm over cook dry fish, the Brussels sprouts with chorizo and bacon??  I liked them but if you&#39;re not adding bacon, don&#39;t added as an ingredient in the description, we also had scallops,  cold too.

The chips and guacamole wer delish!  Loved them.  We had fish tacos - very big pieces of Mahi and Carni Asada (very good a bit chewy though) and Brussels Sprout - which had a bit of a kick.  The Sangria was good ALTHOUGH the price for the cocktails was VERY expensive for the glass size.  We were a bit dis-satisfied with this, either get bigger glasses or lower the price!  Server was very attentive at the beginning but after we received our dinner she stopped by once and then didn&#39;t show up until we completed done, drinks gone, we sat a very long time until she showed up again.  Never offered dessert, at one point we tried getting her attention as she stood around the bar talking with her co-workers.  The noise level was very HIGH and often so loud we could hardly hear each other across the table.  This really can&#39;t be helped because of the high ceilings, but good to know if you are going to catch up with a group, you will have a hard time hearing each other.  Would I go back? Probably but probably wouldn&#39;t go at peak time, wouldn&#39;t order a cocktail....If there was a 3 1/2 star I would give it that."

Enjoyed a Michelada with that which was exactly the flavoring I like with those so I was happy. Everyone else had Tradicional Margaritas and really enjoyed those (very refreshing).

I had the fish tacos and the fish was perfectly tender and tacos very tasty.

Everyone really enjoyed themselves and we all were very happy we gave it a shot.

Honestly, just as good as Bien Trucha in my opinion.

Give it a shot!"

Started with a traditional margarita that was divine. Even better was the second margarita made with a top shelf tequila!! They are way too delicious. 

Next up was the epazote guacamole....with the crispy tortilla chips. So easy to sit and eat this fresh creamy and picante dip all day. We did move on to tacos with a side of corn. Loved that I could order my shrimp tacos on lettuce leaves instead of tortillas. 

The flan and the Mexican chocolate ice cream were divine.

I had to haggle a persistent waiter to get hot sauce to put on my tacos - they clearly display hot sauce at their bloody mary bar, but adamantly refuse to serve it with food. They do not serve blended margaritas either. The alcohol menu is misleading in that the &#34;5&#39;s&#34; listed next to certain beers are not the price of the beverage but rather the &#34;type&#34; of beer - we were charged $8 for a flight of four beers that appeared to be priced at $5. We ordered two of these beer flights and the waiter completely forgot to deliver the second one - we eventually just canceled the order.

I also shared a margarita with one friend and the other got a caramel beer. Everything was great! The presentation was unexpected, as my enchiladas were &#34;deconstructed&#34;, aka the fillings were on top of a tortilla square. Regardless, it tasted great and the green rice was delicious. The service was excellent, although it seemed like the staff were attempting to come across as very authentic and classy and falling a bit flat with awkward sounding Spanish and unfamiliarity with the menu.

Cool place lots of natural light during the day, 5 rabbitt on tap . .very nice....Lots of cool tequillas .. .

Mango habernero margarita is nothng special, all the fancy tequillas are ound and he makes from the well, I should of called one ,,, forgot wish the bartender would of asked.  ..anyway no habernero flavor in the drink just kind of boring.

Chips are good with a bean dip, tastes straight from can.

Elote . .. really frozen corn not grilled at all with may and tajin, would of been of with roasted corn.

Ceviche  . .meh..not that good not that bad . .. just ok

Anyway its frustraiting to have kind of a cool place with kind of boring food and drink quality . ..

Chorizo bacon brussels sprouts!

Order several taco entrees and share them. Nice flavor variety and good attention to detail.

Paying for the salsas was appropriate because they were worth it. One of the highlights of the meal. I can imagine dropping by to snack on chips and ordering a few margaritas.

Driving past Puebla, I suggested we give it a try and hope it&#39;s similar to Bien Trucha.  We were very pleased with the place and happy to now have another option in the modern Mexican realm of dining.

We started with a couple of their salsas at $2 apiece (chips come with it).  We had the Chipotle and the Chile de Arbol Salsa.  Both were excellent.  The portions were small, but our waiter grabbed one of them and refilled it after it was finished, so perhaps refills are free?  I didn&#39;t mind paying for the salsa.  Most upper end Mexi joints are charging for it now anyway, including Bien Trucha and Lupitas.  

We tried the Poblano corn and the green rice appetizers and found them outstanding and decadent.  I get the rice and corn apps at Bien Trucha without fail, and didn&#39;t find these to be any better or worse, in all honesty.  The main difference was that the rice was a light green.  Not sure why, but it tasted nice.  

Had the tacos Al Pastor.  My wife had tacos with what looked like shrimp and avacados on them.  She couldn&#39;t stop raving about them.  Mine were good, but not great.  I would rate the flavor of the Pastor tacos around a 6 or 7.  My main objection to them was that the quality of the tortillas was such that while trying to eat the tacos, the tortillas tended to soak through and fall apart, so that I was eating a taco that was basically disintegrating in my hand while trying to eat it.  My wife&#39;s taco shells held together just fine.  Perhaps something in my tacos tended to soak more easily into the shell.  

I&#39;d been drinking enough prior to visiting Puebla, so I had a Coke.  My wife tried a mango margarita and said she loved it and would order it again soon.  

The atmosphere is pretty relaxed and a more suburban than Bien Trucha which is a bit more upbeat/metro.  The place is enormous and is done up in very high quality woods, tiles and fixtures.  It has an overall very comfortable feeI.  I loved the long bar and appreciated that there are a couple of flat screens in there for times when just in case there&#39;s a big game happening that you don&#39;t want to miss. 

We will most definitely be returning here...soon.  I really liked it and give it a 4.  My wife would probably be in the 4.5 to 5 star territory and she can&#39;t wait to tell all of her friends about it."

After waiting 10 minutes to be seated, another 10 for our drinks to arrive while only 4 other tables were filled in this place. Do not order the traditional margaritas which are basically ice, shittly salted to one side lime water! Served in a scoth glass claiming to have 2 ounces of liquor in them (guaranteed NO LIQUOR IN THEM) while the whole drink is 2 ounces. Itself for 10$!!! Total rip off!!! Besides the slow service and being conned of 10$ on lime water the &#34;manager&#34; did not get a name possibly Pueblo himself, chased us to the front door very unprofessional acting as though we did not pay pur bill!

The service was excellent, and our server was very accommodating for our group of about 12 people. The bean dip they give you and the salsa verde was very good. I ordered the pescado, however, which was very bland in my opinion. The flavors were boring. My friend ordered the puerco y mole, which was very tasty on the other hand. It seems like the food might be hit or miss. I don&#39;t live close enough to this restaurant to be back any time soon, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s kinda mediocre."

First, the side order of corn was not sweet and was overlooked.
Second, the mojito drink was bitter...too much mint.
Third, the tilapia tacos were served on wilted lettuce so you couldn&#39;t even pick up the taco.
Fourth,  the Mexican cheesy rice was TOO salty.

We really wanted to have a delicious meal but were completely disappointed.
We won&#39;t be back."

And that includes being in Mexico on 5 different occasions. I had a traditional Margarita, it was very well made. My wife had a raspberry serano margarita and not only was it unique, it was awesome. It had a spicy kick as a finish. For starters we had mango guacamole, which I&#39;ve never had but will certainly order again.  I had the fish tacos which were extremely well balanced, tasty and included a tempura avocado. We also had chicken tinga tacos with bibb lettuce instead of tortillas. Again, well balanced and delicious. 
Dessert was flan but not your typical flan. This was served with some diced pineapple and some thin strips of cinnamon points. 
The ambience was good although the restaurant was not crowded and the service was exceptional. Our servers name was Dawn. I would recommend requesting her."

She also didn&#39;t know if they had Tecate as an option. Um.. What? Her response to my shock? &#39;The bartenders aren&#39;t Mexican.&#39; Um...what?  Apps: we ordered salsa and quac. The quac was borderline puréed. Which is a weird quality in a guacamole. Smooth, creamy guacamole sorta seems unnatural. Salsa was okay.  Entrees: We ordered chorizo tacos (pretty good), pollo tacos (meh), steak tacos (good) and fish tacos (no go-now I can&#39;t wait to go to my fave fish taco place-Jalepeno Grille).  Side dishes: we ordered a corn side (delicious) and a rice side (never received it).

My wife, her friend and I went on a Saturday afternoon. There were three tables of customers and ten waiters sitting around talking. No one came up to us for ten minutes, I finally had to flag someone down. I can understand if it was busy, but the place was empty; most of the staff were literally standing by the bar talking.

The menu is very limited. Meals are tacos or a few other things. We had the carne tacos and flautas; they were OK, nothing special. The fixed up the place from the last restaurant that was there, so the atmosphere was nice. 

There are enough over-priced Mexican, boutique restaurants is the area. These guys are going to have to do something special if they want to attract customers."

Noelle was our server and boy was she pushy. She must of came over 5-6 times to ask if we were ready to order. There were 3 couples enjoying a nice time catching up with no kids and she made it very uncomfortable as we felt that we had to order otherwise she wouldn&#39;t stop hounding us.

I went to Puebla this past Friday with a friend who was visiting from out of town. We had a great experience.

Drinks - standard margarita = very good, Sweet &amp; Smokey margarita = amazing! We also tried the avocado margarita which was very different. We weren&#39;t fans of it but it wasn&#39;t horrible.

Salsa &amp; Guac - We had the Chile de Arbol salsa and the Pablano guacamole. Both were great! 

Tacos - We tried the chicken tinga and tacos al pastor. The chicken tacos were very good but the al pastor was our favorite. The grilled pineapple added just enough sweetness and was just different enough to make it interesting without being weird.

Sides - Elote = just OK, we had both had better; Papas fritas = nothing special.

Our waitress was awesome! Very nice and helpful talking about the drinks and food items. 

The atmosphere is great. Very modern but still inviting. It&#39;s a great place and very well done. I&#39;ve liked the style of the past 2 restaurants in this building. Hopefully Puebla will stay around for a while.

I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

You can order it spicier, but the flavor was amazing anyway.  Absolutely delicious food, and great friendly service.  

The ONLY reason it doesn&#39;t get five stars from me is because a tiny serving of salsa is $3.  Most Mexican restaurants give chips and salsa for free.  But anyway, the main course was worth waiting for.  Also because it&#39;s a little loud for my taste.

The Avocado salsa (it&#39;s not guacamole, as far as I&#39;m aware) is phenomenal!!!"

Well, this adventure was not only overpriced, but completely ruined our day.
First of all, we should have known something&#39;s wrong when we walked in, since the place had an overall atmosphere of a funeral home. 
We waited for about 15 minutes to be helped, even though there were only two other guests at that moment (and, they looked miserable). 
Now, as far as food goes...It was completely bland (unless you call overused cooking oil flavorful) and didn&#39;t even smell enticing.
The goulash meat was full of those chewy tendons and cartilage...The dumplings tasted like warmed up leftovers - they were hot on the outside while the middle was cold.
This was a disgrace. There was no one even around to ask us how we were doing and if everything was OK, until it was time to pay our check...
It was one of those moments when you realize that whatever feedback you have to give should be kept for yourself, because not only that you won&#39;t get an apology but you&#39;ll probably just end up feeling humiliated. 
I would say, if you want to get rid of someone for good (like, someone you don&#39;t want to date anymore, or a cousin out of town that keeps coming to visit but then messes up your house every time, or such), just take them to Bavaria Hof and your problem will be taken care of. But, if you care for your friends, family or yourself, you will want to take them somewhere else. Read the reviews before you go!"

This restaurant apparently has a long reputation for nasty service, but we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I wish we had believed the reviews because it would have saved us a very unpleasant experience!

When we arrived for dinner, the place was empty; now I know why.  The owner was insulting and dictatorial, and the waitress was exceptionally rude.  When we politely requested separate checks we were brusquely told, &#34;The restaurant rules forbid separate checks and you must obey the rules.&#34;  Maybe military obedience is expected in other cultures, but this is America and we don&#39;t adapt well to obeying orders issued by waitresses.

One of our group members wanted to use a Groupon and the waitress, hostess, cashier, bartender (she was one person doing all four jobs) rudely told our member she could not use the coupon unless she and three other people moved to another table.  Then the hostile owner appeared and told us that since our group had made a single reservation, none of us would be allowed to move.

When we expressed our displeasure she said, &#34;You people have had too much to drink and I&#39;m cutting you off.&#34;  At that point we had consumed perhaps 2 or 3 ounces each.

Fortunately, we knew of a Nigerian restaurant just a few doors away, where on a previous outing we had enjoyed excellent service and outstanding food.  We called for our check at Bavaria Hof, paid it, walked out, and headed for the Bisi restaurant.

While we were having our appetizers, two Schaumburg police officers came in and came over to our table.  They told us the owner of Bavaria Hof had called them and complained that we had been rude, noisy, and disruptive, and had disturbed other customers with our alcohol induced behavior.  We chatted with the officers and presented our version of events, after which they concluded that the complaint was obviously unfounded.  They apologized for interrupting our meal and left.

I counted the negative reviews of Bavaria Hof, and I found 52.  The owner posted a reply to most of these reviews, made snarky personal comments about the reviewers, and called many of then liars.  With a sample size of 52, I think the credibility of the reviewers is unquestionable.  The owner&#39;s replies all seem to be nothing more than school yard denials.  If a reviewer said the waitress was rude, the owner&#39;s response was just, &#34;No she wasn&#39;t.&#34;

Since this is a negative review I expect the owner will write a reply the same way she replies to other negative reviews, and will call me a liar.  My advice is to read all the reviews and decide for yourself who is presenting the truth, the owner or the victims."

Just because we asked for separate checks, and when we complained and asked why we were accused of drinking to much. (We had just received our drinks) and none of us  had hardly sipped them yet!  
Then we left, and they not only charged us for our drinks, but they also added $2.95 for each glass of water!!   Terrible, I would never ever go back!!

Yes, you always compare food to your mother&#39;s, but this isn&#39;t what anyone who loves German food should go to.

Schnitzel was gristly, too many sweet overtones to pickled things that shouldn&#39;t be sweet.

We found the service to be fine...food came quickly. The bright spot by far was the selection of on tap biers..THAT was a good thing.

We should&#39;ve turned around when we walked in the door to literally only one other table in the place, and they were all packed up and ready to go."

Me, my husband, and step son bought a Living Social coupon for this place thinking we&#39;d eat some good German food for lunch. Boy was I wrong. We walk in at 1 pm; the place is completely empty. We sit down. Come to find out our coupon  is no good. The waitress tells us it&#39;s not applicable for lunch, however; the fine print doesn&#39;t even mention that. But we decide to stay.  I ordered a beer and was asked to provide two forms of identification. Oooookay. The leek soup tasted like flour water. We had to add a shit ton of salt and pepper to it and even then it had no flavor. The bread basket was slices of stale bread, but unfortunately the bread and butter was the only thing edible. Oh! How can I forget the famous Bavarian pretzel! It came out immediately and looked nothing like a pretzel. Wasn&#39;t even the shape of a pretzel. I&#39;d bet my life on the assumption it was frozen dough microwaved. Now the main entree. Ohhhhh the main entree. I ordered  the Sauerbraten. It was a very small portion of iridescent colored, dry,  old meat of some sort with no flavor. The gravy turned into gel as it cooled. Spaetzl had no flavor but that&#39;s OK because the red cabbage made up for it. The red cabbage was sooooo sweet. Totally inedible. OK, onto my husband&#39;s meal. Again a small portion of what was supposed to be a pork chop turned out to be a fucking ham slice. This place sucks. I got my food to go only to give to my dog. As my husband paid he mentioned to the owner how displeased we were. She argued with him asking why we didn&#39;t return our food. Perfectly logical question. Well the reason we didn&#39;t return our food was why return shit just to get more shit? I suppose we could have returned it and maybe had it taken off our 70$ bill. I don&#39;t know. I feel raped and bullied by the owner. Do not eat here. Just don&#39;t. Read the reviews first."

We asked if we could do separate checks and we&#39;re told we could move our group to different tables.  They charged us $2.95 for glass of tap water. Owner didn&#39;t want to work with us but got very defensive and combative and told us to go somewhere else which we did.  Far better experience at other restaurant.  Really wish I would have read the other reviews before.  I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone!!!  Not unless you want bad service, overcharged and insulted.  No stars!

Also the owner responded to others in party that sent in their comments and her response back is not accurate and lies.  The reviews speak for themselves!  We are not the only party to receive horrible and rude service and the owner and her wait staff were rude and unwilling to help resolve the situation but compounded it.

We were not offered option of separate checks but told to split our group up to diff tables.  My friend said you want us to fuck up your service by splitting us all up?  She then insinuated the alcohol must be the problem when we were just seated with our one drink that wasn&#39;t finished.  We were also told we could go somewhere else which we were happy to do.  Then she said we didnt know how to read the bill which said water for $2.75.  Again, insulting!  As we left my friend asked who the owner was after being treated so awfully and shared what he thought of her as he was walking out.  He didn&#39;t attack or assault.  Freedom of speech!!  Guess you never heard of that!!"

We purchased a Groupon for Bavaria Hof, even though it was a 45 minute drive from our house, because we like trying new places and saving a little money always helps.  Especially when the menu is overpriced, as it is here.

The only good thing we found about Bavaria Hof was the split pea soup and the red cabbage.  Everything else seemed to be boiled, and had much less flavor than other German food we&#39;ve experienced. 

To top it off, the waitress appeared to only want to hear positive comments and was quite rude when we tried to give our feedback on the food.

We will not return."

Now, we visited again with a Restaurant.com certificate, to meet another friend in town for dinner.

We came and were showed to a good table by a young host, and the restaurant was about 1/3 full at 5:30 on a Friday evening. A fair crowd for the time.

We perused the menu with many great German dishes, many bringing back memories from my childhood (yep, I&#39;m German). The prices, however, held us back from freely choosing. Our server, possibly the owner, was also very direct and gruff - perhaps again, authentic German, though most people are far more hospitable. She was direct and opinionated, starting nice but ending up almost telling us what we would or wouldn&#39;t like. Maybe fitting a direct, German atmosphere, but a little unsettling even for somone who is used to dealing with direct, opinionated Germans - especially in a restaurant setting. ;-)

The food was actually excellent! Moderate serving size, but very good quality and well prepared. I tried the Eisbein (Pork shank) and the meat fell off the bone with a wonderful flavor. This was probably the smallest portion of this dish I&#39;ve received, but it&#39;s still penty for one meal. I was satisfyingly full, but not stuffed.

Now, about that atmosphere...

The place looked fine, and was well kept. When we came before, there was an older man playing all manner of fun music. I had asked about this before coming, and told they did not have music. When we got there and started getting our food, here came that same older gentleman to begin by playing the cowbells! Very loud for a mid-sized restaurant, but kind of fun. He proceeded to play beer bottles, two trumpets at once (actually, pretty good) and even a xylophone. He played traditional music and some contemporary hits. He is quite talented, though not the best singer. Quirky as heck, but fun if you&#39;re not sitting right by the music.

Overall, the food is very good and traditional German! I strongly recommend this as compared to, for example, the more generic (though still decent) fare at Hofbrau Haus in Rosement - see another review for this one. The prices, however, are very high. Maybe not exceptional for the food in an upscale setting, but definitely at the limit for the quirky music and gruff service.

A note to the owner - the food is fantastic, and the chef gets compliments on the menu, quality and preparation! The music is fun, but customers may need to be prepared in case they get seated too close and can&#39;t carry on conversation. Customer service could use some polish! Smile more, and use more that direct German hospitality we saw shining through.

To summarize, come here for the food, and seek out some discounts to offset the prices. The meals are fantastic and authentic, and worth a little quirkyness. Three stars instead of four because of the mediocre service and louder music."

We wanted to share a meal of Wiener Schnitzel with a couple of extra side dishes.  

The waitress informed us there would be a &#34;split plate fee&#34; of $3.50 and we agreed thinking they would bring the meal and sides split on two plates with the food garnished, for two people.  Wrong, the Wiener Schnitzel and bread dumplings came on one plate with the sides in a bowl and she dropped a small salad plate on the table for us to use. Why the $3.50 split plate fee if we were doing the splitting?

The tomato soup was very salty, the Wiener Schnitzel was bland, soggy and not crispy. It looked and tasted like it was cooked ahead and microwaved for us.  The fried potatoes were unseasoned and oily and the bread dumplings tasted like condensed stovetop stuffing. The sauerkraut, at least for me, was inedible.  

The best part of the meal, sadly, was the tap water."

What they have on their menu is all german dishes - no doubt. Only the taste is way off. It&#39;s not authentic german - real german food tastes way better without being that expensive. 
I am german, born and grown up in Germany so I know what I am talking about. 
We started with the salad that came with the meal... This was a small plate with beans, cucumber, tomatoes and beets. Beans and cucumbers were ok but everything had a sweet overtone. The Tomatoes were inedible... They were kind of chewy, comparable to chewing gum and did not taste like tomatoes. A really weird structure that I never experienced with tomatoes before. We could not eat them.
The Wiener Schnitzel was tasteless, besides the greasily taste... It tasted like it was fried in too much oil. Same thing for the fried potatoes. When you take the same pan with the same oil over ond over again you have those small black burnt residues in your pan - that&#39;s basically what my potatoes were covered in. 
My husband had the pig roast and it really was nothing else thn pulled pork. A pig roast like we do it in Germany is a lot different. The Spaetzle were tasteless, the gravy had a strange taste.
The beer was good - it came in a bottle. 

The whole menu is overpriced. The food is expensive for what you get. 
Maybe we came with too high expectations or we simply know the real german food too well. 

Service was ok and the waitress was friendly in her way. Nothing to complain about here.
Maybe just an advice... I ate approximately 3/4 of my schnitzel (I hate wasting food) and very little potatoes. She asked me if I want a box and I said no. I would have expected the question &#34;was anything wrong with the food&#34;. That&#39;s what I would wonder if a nearly full plate goes back."

We didnt initially intend to come here, but we happened to stumble upon this place. So, to start off we had the potato pancakes with apple sauce. It was good.

Chicken schzitnel was good, bread dumpling was really good. The gravy was really awesome I must say. The red cabbage was good in my opinion ( a little sweet) but good. Then we finished it off with apple strudel. (Too much whipped cream :p). But overall really good. The only thing is its expensive. Was it worth $20 I paid - not really. I mean it was pricy in my opinion. Service was good though.

My wife had the Bavarian Hof sampler (beef, chicken, &amp; ham) and I had the Weiner Schnitzel. Both very good. I haven&#39;t had a lot of German, but on par to what I&#39;ve had before.

Very quiet, not a lot of people but it was on a cold Tuesday evening.

We checked and she did NOT charge us the automatic 18% tip many people said she does. We had our meals, I had a draught beer (.5L) and wife had a Coke. She tallied it up, calculated tax and total, then took off our Living Social coupon...that&#39;s it, so I tipped her on the original amount. Regular, simple.

I find it very telling that the owner of this wreck chooses to argue with the Yelp reviewers and leave snarky comments back to them, rather than see the negative reviews as a chance to improve operating performance. I was very interested to see how she would respond to my original review, but she has chosen to remain silent, at least for now.

and now to address some of the things in your reply to me, you DO have a sausage platter with 4 sausages, here it is copied directly from your website: (39) Bayrische Brotzeit   $19.95 1 Bratwurst, 1 Knackwurst, 1 Thüringer &amp; 1 Boneless Kassler.

The roast pig platter: Like i said in my previous review tasted like it was cooked in a pot of water. No idea where the term Roast comes from. The pig is not roasted at all nor does it have a roast flavor to it. 
 Going to a German restaurant i understand that there is no BBQ but THANK YOU for clarifying that for me. If i would&#39;ve wanted BBQ pork i would&#39;ve gone to a BBQ restaurant. The waitress said it was cooked over a pit. Maybe she said cooked in a pot. 

The bus boy did not speak English nor did he not understand what we asked for. we asked for water 3 times until my husband said it in Spanish and then he nodded his head and got the water. 

YOU ARE  100% correct that it is called Maders and not Mathers like i typed. Auto Correct. Thank you SO much for clarifying that for everyone.

I wished I had read the reviews posted on Yelp before buying the Groupon.   This restaurant is NOT German, except for the (there&#39;s only one) waitress (we think she was also the owner).  Nothing in this building will remind you of Germany; no decor and/or background music.  

Looking forward to an outing with another couple, we ended up in this nearby place, none of us had ever been to.   I, too, had to laugh along with other Yelp comments, because at 6:45pm on a Sat.  there was no need for a reservation, which they only take for a party of 5+.  We thought we would be waiting outside for our table.   Ended up the four of us were seated, shortly thereafter, a neighbor showed up.  We requested they be seated at a table next to ours.   We were told that was impossible, as the table next to our was already reserved for a party of two (on the phone I was told &#34;reservations are taken only for parties of 5+).   The place was full of empty tables, yet we could not be accommodated.

We ordered 2 appetizer plates and got 4 potato pancakes for $10.00 and a sausage plate for $10.00 that barely contained enough food for one person.  I must admit that both appetizers were delicious. I ordered sauerbrauten for the main course.  It was watery and tasted like nothing but very strong vinegar.   I do like vinegar, but hoped to taste the meat, too.  The gravy looked good, but was tasteless.    The sauerkraut was good, but a very tiny portion.   All four of us commented on the fact that FOOD WAS NOT GOOD, the PORTIONS WERE VERY SMALL AND THE PRICE WAS WAY TOO MUCH.    Also, read the fine print, you will pay an automatic 18% gratuity, on any bill where a coupon is used.    Two of us at our table have a German heritage, we know what the food should taste like; this was NOT it.

If you want excellent German food, along with an authentic atmosphere and a reasonable price, head over to Fritzl&#39;s, 377 Rand Road, Lake Zurich.   The Lake Zurich address may make you hesitate, but it&#39;s  on the northern border of Palatine and not a bad/far drive at all.   This place is like a cute Alps chalet, with GREAT FOOD, ample portion  and reasonably priced.  Hope this helps!"

We ordered and shared the gluten-free sausage appetizer which was super yummy! I saw some negative reviews about this appetizer...the size was appropriate for an appetizer, a generous taste served with sour kraut and fantastic mustard.  
I ordered schnitzel (veal) with dumplings. My friend ordered Hungarian goulash with spaetzle (ok how do you spell that?!). Both meals were fan-flippin-tastic! Not sure what the table in front of us ordered but it smelled divine as well! This place serves great homemade German cuisine. Dinner prices average $15-19/plate which may sound higher priced to some but folks remember they&#39;re not opening jars or pushing the defrost button on the microwave for a mass-produced, preservative-rich meal. I loved the food &amp; will be back for sure. 
PS - we were not charged a &#34;mandatory gratuity&#34; as per some other reviews I read. We did ok with basic middle school math and were smart enough to tip 20% on the original amount of the bill, not the final discounted amount. Drinks, appetizer, two dinners and plenty of left-overs for our husbands to munch on for around $50-60 prior to using our certificate...that&#39;s not bad for Friday night dinner, all homemade!  :)"

It was great.  Great for a place to serve Schnitzels.  However,  I don&#39;t think i&#39;ll be going back.  To start:  the place was understaffed, with one service (owner) and a bus boy.  I think they are just trying to cut cost as much as possible, however this is hurting them.  

On top of that, NEVER PUT A MANDATORY TIP IN THE CHECK unless its a large party. I brought my father there so it was just the 2 of us. She added 18% tip to the check. Personally, I think she would be lucky to have gotten 10% from me based on the service (empty drinks and had to waive her for refill). The fact she mandated that i tip her 18% it just a slap to my face as a customer.  

The fact is she is owner, so she collects profits and she&#39;s attempting to pocket &#34;Mandatory&#34; tips from people is pathetic.  Maybe she put it in place because people weren&#39;t tipping her, which makes sense. 1 person can not wait an entire restaurant, so i can understand if they weren&#39;t tipping her. 

At the rate they are going, and just judging from reviews you can tell they will not stay afloat for long. 

As i said, I&#39;d love to have a place like this i could go weekly, every other week.  however, i am inclined to avoid this establishment after my experience.  If it was a bad server i could understand but this is all from an owner. so i know what will happen next time (no second chances)"

We sat for literally 15 minutes without acknowledgement from either worker. No water. No drink order. Not even a glance our way.

I&#39;ve eaten at some really good German restaurants before and I&#39;ve eaten at some ok German restaurants before. This doesn&#39;t fit in either category.

The only positive I can say is that the red cabbage and the sauerkraut was good. My son had the chicken cordon bleu, which I didn&#39;t try, so maybe it was ok.
I had the Schweine Schnitzel and my hubby had the Veal Rahm.  The first thing I noticed was that my cutlet was very tough and hard to chew. So was hubby&#39;s veal.  
The dumplings were meh as they had some spice in them that was very strong.
The bread that they give you before the meal tasted dried out and didn&#39;t taste fresh or home-made.  

We even went as far as trying the apple strudel, hoping for some light at the end of the tunnel.  Nope, not even.  It was in the shape of a slice of coffee cake and it tasted closer to an apple pie than a strudel, with no strudel topping to be seen.  It was a layer of doughy pie crust, filled with sliced apples with cinnamon and another layer of doughy pie crust.  I had to struggle with it to cut a piece off because the dough was so chewy and rubbery.  The apples tasted dry, without any good caramelized sauce which I would have thought would have been  enveloping the apples. It was covered by a heavy layer of whipped cream.  It wasn&#39;t horrible, but not exactly what I would expect for german apple strudel.

The service was decent though.  The interior seemed kind of outdated and not very appealing, either.

I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place and I won&#39;t ever be back. I hope family who lives in the area never asks me to go there, because I wouldn&#39;t without putting up a fight."

There were a few other folks in the restaurant all seemingly enjoying themselves.  I had the Thuringer which was very good and the wife had Rahm Schnitzel which was also very good.  We will be back, the wait staff was very friendly.

Two quick tips if I may, the German salad plate was great, exspecially the beet salad, would be nice if the serving was a bit larger.  Also, ditch the plastic.

Food was solid--not equal to the best German certainly, but 3 or 4 stars. I had wiener schnitzel and my wife the hungarian goulash. Both were good quality and prepared well. I found the fried potato and sauerkraut sides to be excellent. The apple strudel was very good also.

Even though the service was super slow as there was just one waitress, I was in high hopes as the lady reminded me of my Grandmother.    My only guess is because I used a groupon on, they only gave me half a meal, I ordered the Wiener  Schnitzel and when the food came it was the smallest meal I ever received, it was seriously tiny.  Normally, the places that I go to in the City or Wisconsin give you such a big portion that you can not finish it.  My plate looked like a child place and it was not cheap, I think $17.95 or $18.95......the first time in my life, I left a restaurant still hungry.

Do not waste your time or your money on this place, even with a groupon, it was not worth it, giving Germans a bad name!!!"

Gladly, the food did not give us food poisoning, although I can&#39;t say I was a big fan of the small portions. The food tasted home-made, which is another way of saying, I could cook this shit at home.

We went to this restaurant to celebrate an event for my son. He loves German food. We got there and got a table right away. We sat at the table without even water for over half an hour before the waitress came. There was only one waitress and one busboy for the whole place. We thought they were just short of staff so we didn&#39;t complain. We placed our order and a few minutes later got our one piece of bread each and soup. It tasted Just OK.
We waited another 50 minutes for our food to finally come. My $18 salmon was cold and tasted terrible. The vegetables it came with were the frozen mixed veggies you get in a generic bag. I didn&#39;t complain. I just decided we wouldn&#39;t come back. My kids thought their $18 meals were boring. My husband ordered the &#34;all you can eat pig roast&#34;. He got one plate and asked for more. Fifteen minutes later they came out and said they did not have anymore. I waited for the bill and they charged us the full amount for the food. I went up to the front and asked to speak to the manager. The waitress said I could talk to her. I told her very politely how I was disappointed  with my meal, the service and the shortage of food. She got very rude and went back to speak very loudly with someone in the back about how we wanted to eat for free and how I should have returned my food. They took off my husbands meal and basically yelled at me that I should have returned my food if I didn&#39;t like it. What a horrible experience!"

I am a big supported of small businesses and I certainly do not wish this particular restaurant to fail or close down.  But, I really wanted my opinion to be heard  and I feel that if the owner is aware of how many customers that they are losing due to fixable issues, maybe things will improve and make this restaurant a place to go (selfish reason: need good German restaurant nearby to go to!).

I went with three friends for a Friday night dinner.  We got there around 6pm and the place wasn&#39;t too crowded (about 1/3 full), so seating wasn&#39;t a problem.

There was only one full time waitress and another lady who help out and also acted as cashier.  I believe she was the owner.  I also under the impression that the waitress was related (daughter of) the owner.

Three out of four of us ordered beer and we shared 2 orders of Bavarian Style Pretzel s (not my idea!) for appetizer.  I had a bite of the pretzel, it was okay.  I certainly had better ones.  I say skip it.

Many reviewers already mention the &#34;German style&#34; salad, so I skip ahead to review the main course.

One of us ordered all-you-can-eat pig roast, one ordered SausagePlatte, one ordered Sauerbraten, I ordered Hungarian Goulash from the Gluten Free menu.

I was told that the Pig Roast, SausagePlatte, and the Sauerbraten were good.  
The (all-you-can eat) pig roast kept coming. 

As for my Gluten-free Hungarian Goulash, the meal/Goulash itself actually tasted fine.  The Gluten-free bread was definitely not freshly baked (to be fair, they never claimed that it was). I am 99% sure the bread was previously frozen and then defrosted. 

All our meals came with a choice of sauerkraut or red cabbage.  All of us chose the red cabbage and it was decent (then again, it tasted about the same as the jarred red cabbage I bought at the grocery store).

Overall service was so-so (we had the owner and her daughter serving us; Daughter was nicer than the grumpy mother). 

We had a coupon for BOGO Pig Roast (must also buy 2 drinks).  I was aware that we didn&#39;t have 2 orders of Pig Roast.  But, when it was time to pay, I thought I asked the owner/cashier anyway if she was willing to accept the coupon. She was very rudely declined to take off $14.95 (price of the all-you-can-eat Pig Roast) off our bill.   I think if she had politely declined, I would be okay with it.
The Sampler, Sauerbraten, and Goulash cost well over $15 each.  Along with our meal, our bill included about 7 alcoholic beverages, two orders of appetizer, and two desserts.  

In short, the food was so-so and service was below average. I&#39;ll keep a watch on reviews for this place.  Unless, things improve significantly, I will not return to this place."

This restaurant has long had a problem with nasty service.  No, the food / entertainment / non-existent atmosphere do not make up for it.  I was there yesterday for a birthday dinner.  Party of 8...two kids, two teens, couple and grandparents.  Like many restaurants, this place embraces the practice of automatically adding an 18% tip for a party this size.  Problem here is that thinking they have a guaranteed tip, the server is absent, slow and often downright hostile.  We ordered five all you can eat meals and one would think that actually ordering more food was a crime.  Repeat orders were very heavy on noodles and light on meat.  Even people who didn&#39;t order all you can eat were sneered at and treated contemptuously when they asked for take-home containers.

We had no intention of tipping 18% for such service and told them so at payment time.  They ran through a full charge despite this information and then proceeded to verbally abuse us when we refused to sign the slip.  All sorts of nastiness and personal accusations followed in full view of the entire restaurant.  The people who run and work at this place are unprofessional and mean beyond compare.

I am a sucker for pork chops, so one of my favorite menu items is the Kassler Rippchen.  Be sure to try their German potato salad, it has all the tangy vinegar and bacon bits your heart&#39;s desire.  My wife is a fan of the potato pancakes but she likes apple sauce on it, and I like sour cream.  Other favorites include the spaetzle, brats, our choice of schnitzels, and Hackbraten which is actually a meatloaf.

We&#39;ve been several times and enjoy the food and personable service.  At the front of the restaurant there is actually a full bar with bar stools.  The location is easily found on Roselle Road in Schaumburg in a typical strip mall area with plenty of parking."

The meat was so rough that my husband gave up on eating it only after a couple bites. I took over and finished it just because I didn&#39;t want to waste the food.

The liver sausage soup was very salty. I finish the sausage (taste good) but could not get more than a couple spoonful of soup from my cup. I also ordered a cream herring for appetizer and it was okay. 

Won&#39;t go back again."

I decided to come back one day and try some authentic German cuisine like my Mom makes.

When we walked in there was not a customer in the entire place.  That should be a warning for 6:30 on a Tuesday night.  The decor is mediocre and definitely lacks &#34;Deutsche gemütlichkeit&#34;.

The owner/hostess/waitress did not seem to appreciate my joke inquiry of needing a reservation.  We sat down, ordered, and waited.  Amazingly my veal schnitzel, spätzle, and sauerkraut came out in less than 10 minutes.  I swear I even heard the microwave &#39;ding&#39; twice.  The food tasted like it.  The veal was tough and barely had any flavor.  Dropping the food off, not asking if we needed anything else, and not ever returning throughout the meal to check if everything was alright is a big no-no in serving in my eyes (and I did it for many years).

Our waitress also did not seem to be in the mood to drum up extra business or make a regular out of me.  I even dropped a hint that it was my first time there and she seemed to not care or wish me a warm welcome.  Rather than enticing me with a cup of coffee, naming a dessert, or even bringing me a menu, I received a short &#34;Would you like anything else?&#34;.  No, I guess I wouldn&#39;t.

To our true amazement the bored owner/waitress sat at the bar with another employee who read off bad reviews about the restaurant in earshot!  It gave me the idea to write my review here.

While paying at the front diner-style, I noticed the &#34;Reg die net auf&#34; sign on the wall (a dialect German phrase for &#34;Don&#39;t get worked up&#34;).  It&#39;s hard not to, when you pay over $30 a person for mediocre microwave food, sub-par service, and no atmosphere..."

I read the reviews and should have known better but I went anyway. The place is dated which is okay..the table cloth was sticky and gross. I felt dirty just sitting there. The hostess/waitress and possibly owner is exceptionally rude and should not be a server. The potato pancakes were good and dare I say, I would go back just for those. The rest of the food was average to below at best. Pig roast had no flavor, Sauerkraut was more like sour straw, gravy over the pan fried chicken was like curdled milk with no flavor. After a painfully slow dinner service, we had to make a stop next door to Krispy Krunchy Chicken for some real food and as we were sitting there, the people that were sitting near us at Bavaria Hof came in to get some chicken also.. after a short discussion, we learned they did not enjoy their dinner either.  It was difficult to pay the bill because they are way overpriced for the quality of food. Next time I will make the trip to Berwyn and hit Czech Plaza on Cermak (similar style of food..not German/Austrian..but at least it is edible, served with a smile and won&#39;t cost an arm and a leg)"

While it may be too much to compare authentic fare to the country of origin or to a well-established restaurant across the stateline, Hof nontheless could not deliver a well-seasoned, tender or satisfactory meal.

We had the pork roast that&#39;s available every Friday/Saturday night. The roast was not salted and the ubiquitous gravy that seemed to douse every entree is salty. 

I had the sampler, which included the beef roulade, kassler, pork roast and dumpling. That, too, was inadequate. The roulade was and pork roast tough, and dumpling a seemingly gelatinous, bouncy concoction. The kassler was essentially a salty ham, though the one item that I could stomach. My favorite spaetzle was also the same consistency as the dumpling.

And every Friday night, an elderly musician who plays a record-breaking 10 instruments (at least) entertains the crowd with a collection of German and Italian songs. Definitely a draw for family with children. Although it is not conducive for a conversation, his antics which includes cow bells, beer panflute, panflute, xyplophone, 2 trumpets at once, synthetizer etc were entertaining in a gimmicky way."

Whoa! And the service was good.
They have nothing in the way of a green salad and there are many/all meat courses. There is a selection of fish and chicken. I would not suggest the fish - it is not a a seafood restaurant, after all, and the salmon I ordered came out tough as shoe leather. I asked for no meat products except for the fish. When the dish came with potatoes with gravy, the waitress was surprised when I mentioned that it was probably made from beef or pork.... I did ask for butter, but they had none and she offered the oil/make-believe spread...
The service was excellent, aside from the little gravy incident. The waitress elaborated on their new gluten-free dishes, and their future attempt to offer lighter meals. My husband had the sauerbratten (sp?) and said it was fabulous (just like his mother used to make). And, he liked the spaetzle, too. I did not marry him because he likes this dish, thank goodness!
Anyway, it is a quirky little place tucked away in an unassuming strip mall with a fun tiny bar in front and lots of potential for fun."

i came here with my bf on a wednesday night around 7 and we were the only people there which worried me A LOT. we had a restaurant.com certificate so we thought we&#39;d try it out. 

that being said, the cream of cauliflower was actually wayyy better than it sounds. the German salad plate was lacking to say the least with some cucumbers, beets, pickled green beans and tomatoes. 

for main courses i had the Jager Schnitzel (white wine sauce with mushrooms, onions and green pepper) which was crispy and tasty and full of flavor. the bf got schnitzel with red peppers and onions and it honestly tasted like sweet and sour schnitzel. not appealing to me! the spaetzle was mushy and covered in a gelatinous goop of a gravy but the German potatoes were pretty delish. 

the shining star of the experience was definitely the blueberry strudel. nuf said on that one. it&#39;s pretty hard to screw up a dessert in my book. 

sorry for the longwinded-ness but i love detailed reviews of whats good and bad so that&#39;s what you get like it or not!! 


i looooove schnitzel and have had some AWESOME experiences at other German places (Schnitzel Platz in Glendale Heights=AMAZING)...unfortunately i cannot add this one to my list."

Customer Service = Crap

I would&#39;ve given them 5 stars but after what happened last night, I don&#39;t think I would ever order from them again.

Me and my fiance placed an order for delivery  to Mr C&#39;s around 7pm last night for 2 Mr C&#39;s burgers with 2 LARGE drinks, 2 LARGE fries, 1 regular hot dog (no FF)  &amp; 6 hot wings. The woman answering the phone said it&#39;ll take an hour because it was busy.....fine,no problem...

The food came about 1 hr: 15 min-ish, we immediately realized our order was wrong: instead of 2 large drinks and 2 large fries, the woman gave us 2 medium drinks and 1 small fry, WTH?

So we called Mr C&#39;s back and explained to the same woman of the mistake that SHE had done but instead of understanding and coming up with a solution to fix the problem ----- the buffoon began snapping at us and said that she didn&#39;t make a mistake because that&#39;s what we ordered, what a bag full of B.S.!  Eventually, she said she&#39;ll send out the delivery for missing fries &amp; drinks within the next 30 mins, we asked if we should pay the extra cost and give back the wrong food, she said no because it&#39;ll be on the house....fine, no problem...IT NEVER CAME!! 

Like really, what type of restaurant does that? 
As a former cashier and order taker myself, I can&#39;t imagine doing that to any customers because the customer is always right.

After 3 years of ordering, We will never order from them again."

Service was pretty good, and pretty fast.  I had a coupon from the website,  on my phone, and the lady at the counter kind of gave me a hard time about using it, but she did take it. 

I ordered two hot dogs, the kids had a pizza burger, and a regular hamburger.   The total bill was $16,whixh in my opinion is a little high considering the quality of the food.  I could go to portillos, and get about the same price, and get better quality food. 

The hot dogs were not Vienna beef, and the buns seem to be the cheapest buns you can find in the grocery store.  (in fact they seemed a little stale). 
The French fries were just Ok. 

I am also not a fan or places where you can&#39;t just get your own refills, and that you have to ask the staff to fill it for you. 

Overall, it&#39;s a pretty kid friendly place, good if you need a fix quick, but as far as food quality and price.,  I am not sure I would endorse it."

The first time and second time he delivered to me he made sure to tell me that &#34;the tip goes right here.&#34; I&#39;ve worked for tips my whole life and am very good tipper. I would say it was pretty insulting to have him indirectly demand a tip when I always leave one anyway. The third time he complained that &#34;I had him out in this cold weather.&#34; He is a delivery driver thats his job and I&#39;m literally a 1 minute drive away!!!

They have the best french fries, with the skins on and you get a huge order, enough for 2-3 people for $2.50.  They also have great onion rings and gyros.

On an extreme positive note, the good was really good.  My wife and I split a Francheesie and a Gyros.  If you have never had a Francheesie, then you should definitely check it out.  They stuff a hot dog with with cheese, wrap it with bacon, and then deep fry.  It was very juicy and had a great flavor.  They even include fries with it too.  That&#39;s a great deal for under $5.  The gyros was pretty good as well.  It wasn&#39;t the best I have ever had, but it is right behind that top one.  It was flavorful and wasn&#39;t dry at all.

Our kids each had a kid&#39;s meal from the menu.  It&#39;s always nice to see them getting some special attention with their own meals at place like this.  Our son had the corn dog meal and our daughter had the hot dog meal.  Both of them enjoyed their meals as well.  Mr. C&#39;s even includes milk as an option for their meals and that&#39;s awesome.  Quite a few places will charge you or make you buy it separately.  

We will definitely go back at some point to try out the Italian Beef and the Mr C&#39;s Gyros Burger as well as some of the other items on the menu.  If you&#39;re near there, I recommend checking it out!"

We ordered:
Side salad
turkey burger (added fries and drink)
2 Slaw Dogs (these come with fries)
2 Regular Hot dogs (these come with fries, too)

So four hot dogs, enough fries to feed an army, a burger, a salad, and a drink all for $20?!  SCORE!!!

OK, moving on.  The staff is really nice, efficient, and funny.  They were laughing at me when I had to stare at the menu for a good ten minutes trying to decide since everything looked really good!

As for the actual food, it was really good.  My salad was just iceburg lettuce and tomato.  Nothing special.  But my turkey burger was REALLY yummy!  It wasn&#39;t just a previously frozen patty, it was fresh and well-seasoned.  The bun was really good, too.

And everyone is right about the fries--they are really good.  Nice and crispy on the outside and hot on the inside.  Perfect!

They have 99 cent hot dogs on Tuesdays, which is a steal. They are Vienna Beef hot dogs and are really good. I had the gyros for lunch today and it was very tasty---better than the gyros at Chiggy&#39;s in my opinion. I don&#39;t know what it is about the fries, but they are awesome.

Last year they built a new strip mall in Elgin and I saw they were putting in a hot dog joint.  I am always looking for a good dog in the area.  I went in for a hot dog, but when I saw they had a &#34;ripper&#34; dog on the menu I had to give it a try.  Now the regular dog was ok.  They bun was poppy seedless and the dog was lost under all of the toppings.  The hotdog was the size of my pinky.  They also skimp on the pickle.  It is not the wedge that I would like, it was a thin shaved pickle thrown on top.  They throw a handful of fries on top of the dog, but they were a plain frozen fry and not that great.  I had high hopes for the &#34;ripper&#34; dog.  It was a jumbo dog that was deep fried.  Now what I understand a &#34;ripper&#34; dog is thrown in the fryer and sits there until it &#34;rips&#34; open.  This was sliced with a knife and warmed in the oil.  I would have loved to see some color put onto the dog but really it was just a warm hotdog.  
When I was a kid there were hot dog places everywhere.  Now an independent hot dog joint is a rarity and it breaks my heart when they are not good.  I wish this place had great hot dogs and fries, but sadly it does not stand out."

Every night I have gone in the Hideout whether I go in with a friend, hang out with a regular or hang out with the bartender Dave or the owners Todd &amp; Jen I have a good time.  But I finally got a chance to make a Yelp review and I am astonished that I am not giving my favorite regular bar a 5 star.  I don&#39;t know why Dave left and his gf Kim coming out once in awhile as a regular was pretty cool too.  

It&#39;s ok he left I&#39;m fine with that but I want to give Jen and Todd some advice.  The new bartender AJ is not cool.  He seriously needs bartending skills.  He cannot make Long Island Ice Tea.  Let alone know what a Tokoyo Tea is.  He dosen&#39;t card people he&#39;s never seen before.  He is not friendly.  He&#39;s ranting it&#39;s a dive bar and people are suppose to order beer but there&#39;s a wall of hard liquor ranging from flavored vodka to coconut rum.  He seems lazy and doesn&#39;t want to take the time to learn drinks and increase his speed.  

Other than that I love the Hideout and all the other staff and karaoke.  Either get another bartender or fix AJ&#39;s demeanor and tell him to practice at home."

This is the third place. When you need a place to hang out or a night of fun this is a great spot to go to. A typical experience depends on the day but it ranges from free drinks and ignorant comments from the regulars that will have you laughing durring the day. Spectacular singers on karaoke nights mixed with some brave singers. The beer is cold the liqour is well poured, good memories are made bad ones are forgotten, this is truly a place to call your own."

Friendly owners/staff, and an eclectic often eccentric group of patrons this place has every intention of becoming your second home. The vibe is warming, the conversations substantive and the beer is cold. Karaoke is a highlight, all skill levels accepted and always appreciated. Weekends always offer the best experience but good times happen daily. Come in, have fun, be cool to everyone and you&#39;ll be treated like family.

Linda was the bartender on the day that I chose to visit The Hideout and being from the city I did not expect much, I was wrong.  You can look but will not find a bartender with the social skills/bar tending ability as this YOUNG lady has.  The people are the type that you wish to meet at every bar that you enter.  The music, courtesy of the gentleman called Roger was phenomenal.  If you are there, hope that he is as well and the tunes will be on point.

The have lots of drink options I&#39;m looking forward to trying.

Bien Truché has nothing on these peeps.  First, they are very kind and down to earth.  That alone is worth a ton to me.  Great service.  

Had a Bulldog Margarita, which has a coronarita in it.  Yummmmm.  

Appetizer, was corn ezquite, again, sweet corn and incredibly flavorful.  

Shrimp tacos were the special.  TASTIEST I have had, yet.  

Steak tacos.  Tender.  Flavorful and delish!

Four of us had dinner here, we all enjoyed our food, I doubt there are any bad choices on the menu. Prices are reasonable. You can spend less at a chain like Pepe&#39;s and more at trendy Bien Trucha. Our server was great, the place is clean, the menu is fresh and varied.

My issue is that I&#39;d rather they serve three tacos and a side, instead of four tacos. It&#39;s a small complaint, but it adds up because pretty much everyone in my family wants something other than just one thing... It gets repetitive in taste. To purchase sides separately... They are decent sized, but they are quite pricey.

The service is very attentive and friendly.  The waiter that serves us regularly always remembers us and what we like to order and that makes us feel special.

On par with (if not better) Bien Trucha in Geneva so if you&#39;re sick of BT&#39;s obnoxious wait times (because c&#39;mon, it can get ridiculous!) head on over to Lupitas!!

We went here on Taco Tuesday and were the only people there, which I felt was a little odd. Do people just not dig taco tuesday here? When I lived in FL, Taco Tuesday was a huge deal. The place I went to would be packed all day, and here I was with my wife and we were the only people in the restaurant.  Service was top notch, we were the only people in the place so it was expected, but the food just wasn&#39;t very good.  Instead of salsa to start off with, they give you a black bean type dip that is extremely bland, and definitely needed salt. We decided for the guacamole of the day which was Pineapple.  This too needed salt, and the pineapple chunks looked like they came out of a can. I had the Pastor and my wife had the chicken tacos. The problem is that they only used one corn tortilla instead of two, so the combination of the sauces they use and only one tortilla left my taco wet and easy to rip.  My wife gave up trying to eat them as tacos and forked it.  Flavors on Pastor were pretty good, but not enough to warrant another trip.  This is a one and done for me, unfortunately for Lupita&#39;s there is better Mexican in the Tri-Cities."

There have been like five fast food Mexican restaurants that all closed down in this building, but lupitas is sit down, authentic, gourmet Mexican cuisine, and are here to stay.  I usually get chips and guacamole and steak tacos.  All of their tacos are delicious.  I live like two blocks from this place, and I&#39;m so glad that I have this place so close.  
There is only one problem- CHIPS, SALSA,and GUACAMOLE COST MONEY.  The salsas are very mediocre and one of them ruined my meal because it was so spicy.

Update- they bring salsa to the table now so that&#39;s a plus but it&#39;s still a little pricey for Mexican."

I&#39;ve had some pretty sensational Mexican food and places like El Farro, El Parraiso and a few others just didn&#39;t seem to work. Their food was bland and not too fresh. 

Thankfully!!! This place was different. Staff was pleasant. Food was flavorful and fresh and I finally had good Mexican. Only downside was it van get expensive fast with the drinks... And the desserts aren&#39;t anything special.

Apparently, this is where the owner of Fat Rosie&#39;s in St. Charles ended up after that restaurant closed... Which explains a couple of things...

The food is better than average. The poblano sauce with the carne asada was &#34;to die for&#34;, and the chicken fajitas showed up in one of those volcanic rock bowls heated to 1,000 degrees (like they used to use in Fat Rosie&#39;s). By the time I got to the bottom of the bowl, it was still cooking the onions -- nice!

But there was nothing with the fajitas, except for lukewarm rice and black beans. No shredded cheese, no sour cream, no cool lettuce and chopped tomato, no guac. However, the carne asada came with a nice selection of grilled and roasted veggies.

Tacos looked good, served small plate style. Ceviche was very tasty, but there was very little fish in it. And for $10, you can find at least 4 oz of tilapia, right?

No chips and salsa before dinner unless you buy a starter -- seems to be a growing trend in trendy Mexican places...

The piece de resistance, though, was the Pepino margarita (cucumber). We&#39;d go back JUST for that.. And I&#39;d give them 4 stars JUST for that.

So here&#39;s hoping they work out all of the bugs and get their outside patio opened soon. There are going to be a lot of hot summer days where a nice margarita will do the trick..."

If that is what you want, Taco Bell is right up the street on Randall Rd.  This is an upscale Mexican restaurant that is specializing in quality food, and excellent service.  You will not walk out of here without spending $10-15 per person on the cheap side.  If you come, make it for a nice meal, where you can splurge a little bit and get some apps and drinks and really soak this place in.  It&#39;s worth it!  After visiting numerous times, I am happy to finally give my review of this place.

Tacos:  As I have posted in the tips, they have a Taco Tuesday Special, where all of their tacos are $7.99 each.  You get four per order and they are fantastic!  My wife and I have had every one of them now.  Our hands down favorite is the Pastor tacos.  The pork has this amazing smoky sweet glaze on it, served with onions, an green salsa and a stick of fresh pineapple.  I am not a pineapple fan, but have to admit, the combination of it with the smokiness of the pork really go together perfectly.  I can say, without hesitation, they are the best tacos I have had in this area.   Right behind those, the steak tacos are tender and seasoned perfectly.  You can not go wrong with them either.  As stated, we have had all of the tacos.  If you are in the mood for fish or shrimp, give them a try.  They are great in their own ways.  Last time we had the veggie tacos, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were.

Apps:  Again, another area where they are doing it right.  Guacamole is made fresh, ceviche is decent, albeit a tad acidic.  My kids like the Queso fundido.  This last time though, they blew my socks off with a new corn appetizer, called esquites.  I nearly ordered another for dessert, it was so good!  Roasted sweet corn, lime, mayo, cilantro, all mixed together and served with corn chips.  I will be ordering that the next time we go!

Entrees:  To date, I have only had the  Carne Asada A La Poblana.  As with everything else, excellent.  It was the first dish I ever had here.  I would recommend it.

Drinks:  Numerous margaritas.  Wife loves the Jamaica (Hibiscus) Margarita.  I prefer the Tomatillo Margarita.  Can&#39;t seem to get that elsewhere.  Nice twist on the Margarita.  They have roughly 10 kinds though, so you should find one that fits your liking.

Service:  Never once have we had a problem.  Most of the time it is just my wife and I, but we do take the kids on occasion.  Regardless of how many of us there are, they always treat us politely.  Prices might be a little on the high side, but again, I see this as a more upscale mexican restaurant, than a cheap taqueria.  Bottom line, I have yet to leave this place thinking to myself, &#34;man, that meal was sooooo not worth what I just paid for it.&#34;.  They do an excellent job here and I can&#39;t wait to go back!"

Then we ordered our drinks: a Pacifico beer, a margarita and a kiddie cocktail. After another half hour of waiting for our drinks they forget the kiddie cocktail. I ask her again for it and then we waited another 20 minutes to a half an hour so I could ask her again to bring her drink that finally came.
Our food took forever to get to the table and by this time I am overly annoyed. (Thankfully we order the guacamole appetizer that cost a fortune for the little portion received,) so needless to say we were starving when our food got to the table. I will say the tacos were excellent and my husband&#39;s enchiladas in mole sauce was decent, the last part of our evening topped the cake. After dinner we were sitting there for yet another 20 minutes to a half an hour waiting for the waitress to come over so we can pay our bill. At this point the owner comes over apologizes for the delay but then I still waited for the bill! Now the waitress comes up with a piece of cake as an apology! I just want my damn bill. Needless to say we will not be returning. There is no reason for it to take over 2 hours as there are only about 14 tables in the whole place. Unacceptable service for the high price you pay here for Mexican food."

The place is cozy, with a small bar that hosts a bevy of tequilas including Milagro (bonus point).  This place is cute and dimly lit, fairly minimalistic in regards to décor.
My friend and I each ordered a margarita.  He enjoyed a mango drink while I had pineapple.  The drink was fresh and delicious, and had an ample amount of chile lining the rim of the glass.  I had the Matazlan tacos, which were crispy fish tacos, I believe tilapia but strangely, it was not specified on the menu.  The tacos were good, the portion was sufficient, but they didn&#39;t blow me away.  
The service was impeccable and our server was both friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  I found the food to be less innovative than Bien Trucha, that being the obvious comparison others are making...
Overall, this place is delightful with stellar service, but if you are expecting it to be on par with BT it does slightly fall short.  By no means is it a disappointment, it is just different in ways that are both good and bad.  Less assuming, better service, slightly less innovative, and no excruciatingly long wait or loud atmosphere.  I will definitely return to try the vegetarian queso and other fare."

My dining experience here does not match the other reviews.
It was fair, at best.
The food was well prepared, not very warm though, but ok. Flavors were kinda bland. Nothing to write home about, or return for more of. But the darnedest thing was our inability to get a glass of water. We were surrounded by diners with cool, refreshing glasses of H2O. We asked 3 separate people 4 times. Each promising to return with a glass of that which we so thirsted for. But alas, it was not meant to be. We left parched.

First off- the guacamole.  Lupita&#39;s guacamole should be called &#34;cucumber and tomato garnish&#34;.  It is all cucumber, radish and tomato and hardly NO avocado at all.  Last I checked, guacamole was supposed to primarily be avocado.  Don&#39;t waste your time- it is expensive and NOT worth it.

Second- the atmosphere is very ho-hum.  BORING.  They could have really made the place hip and inviting, but instead they very much fell short.  Feels like a fast food restaurant inside-- with tables and white tablecloths.

The enchiladas suizas was tasty- loved the sauce and the chicken was very tender.  I liked it.  My dining partner had the cochinita pibil and he said it was OK. The sauce that came with it was too hot for him to enjoy and he truly loves very hot food. 

There are some pretty amazing Mexican restaurants in the area (El Mocajete, Bien Trucha and A Todo Madre)  that are pretty comparable to the price, so if Lupita;s wants to excel, they need to step it up on food and atmosphere  and lower their prices a couple of bucks.  

Also, I notice that a lot of the other reviewers on this place only have one or 2 reviews.  Does that seem sketchy to anyone else?"

Presentation is suburb service is great and food is very tasty. Especially the panza tacos (pork belly). You&#39;ll find that the flavor combinations are clearly chef created with well rounded flavors. We are lucky to have them in wasco, my only fear is that suburban folks who don&#39;t have much experience with food or travel will be a little overwhelmed and quick to give bad reviews.

Fish tacos and Guac were excellent.  A little pricey in my opinion (especially for lunch, $40) but very good food.  Trying to be like Bien Trucha.

Service attentive.  Had the enchiladas with green sauce. Very tasty.  Came with beans and rice.  Cost a bit more than some Mexican places but there was no old grease taste in the beans that you get at most of those places.  Food was fresh and interesting.  They have been open for 5 weeks. They began with a modest menu that they can handle right now.  They plan to expand the menu as time goes on.  Looking forward to it."

First off, the prices are outrageous and in my opinion a rip off. I have been to my share of fancy mexican joints... ie bien trucha in Geneva(AMAZING). Aside, I am from Bridgeport originally and am used to a good authentic mexican place. I was really hoping the food would be good here, being a recent transplant. My husband and I got the steak and fish tacos. The fish tacos were quite literally a fish stick wrapped in a tortilla. The steak tacos were decent but very small portions considering the price. Beans and rice were an extra $3.00 each. If you have a taste mexican ... I recommend you keep looking."

The appetizer recommended was a slab of cheese with some tortillas - we had to cut it to get it out of the dish and after all that it was boring.  The steak tacos were good but the chicken were tasteless. The server noted that we didn&#39;t eat the appetizer and offered a replacement which we refused - and they still charged us.  So $35 for two taco plates and an appetizer and I left hungry and unhappy. We live around the corner and would have loved a new spot to dine. Not  going to happen again.

Ive longed for a mexican breakfast since i last went there 3 years ago so i couldnt wait to try. My girlfriend and i stopped in on a saturday morning and ended up paying 30 bucks for a puny burned omlette(no more thsn 3 eggs, totally flavorless) and 2 eggs on 2 tiny tortillas with litterally a spoonful of rice and beans.

My own imposed rules for any Chain Restaurant review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Since the food should be the same everywhere, with the exception of regional items, the food category will only be judged on the quality of the expected food (i.e. temperature, consistency, and amount).
3. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Wendy&#39;s - Elgin Southwest

Location/Layout - 4.5/10:  This Wendy&#39;s location can be found on McLean Blvd just south of Route 20, adjacent to a Jiffy Lube.  The interior is usually fairly clean and sports the standard Wendy&#39;s interior, which is not screaming for an update but is showing its ware.  Although, like all Wendy&#39;s the fountain divides the two available registers, one of which is never in use, making getting refills a pain and extremely time consuming for both you and the employees.  Parking is ample and well maintained.        

Service - 5.5/10: The order takers are usually friendly, accommodating and accurate.  The drive through is usually very expedient, especially when compared to other Wendy&#39;s.  The lone issue that I have is the location will make you wait in line for a refill even as they are filling other drink orders.  I personally never jump the line, which is what about every other person that dines in a Wendy&#39;s does, but other locations usually note the reason for your return visit to the counter and address your need while filling other drinks.  

Food - 6/10: In general I prefer Wendy&#39;s as a fast food burger option for both their burgers and chicken.  The burgers are always hot and fresh with the most natural tasting and freshest toppings in the industry.  Chicken sandwiches, especially my industry favorite, Spicy Chicken are usually prepared when ordered at this location instead of sitting precooked and waiting for a taker.  The optional sides, instead of fries are genius and much appreciated, especially given the ample options for a fast food burger joint.  Again the lone issue is that a trip for refills can create cold food upon your return, which hurts the food score for this location.      

Overall Experience - 6/10:  This Wendy&#39;s location offers a fairly solid fast food experience and is usually accommodating and quick to fill orders.  Location, quality, and speed are the main assets of this location especially given my time at the nearby Sports Complex."

Well now Here I am doing the worst bc your store management must have either changed or when the other 3 Wendy&#39;s opened up near by you guys stop giving a fck. Either way I was served a chicken sandwich with cheese and I&#39;m allergic to cheese and the sandwich doesn&#39;t come with cheese normally. Simple mistake in my opinion. However as soon as I go back around to talk the manager they told me to call tomorrow to talk to the store manager about a refund considering I had to buy medicine for my allergic reaction (Yes I have an epi pen and yes I am physically allergic to dairy) The next day I called and was told I would get a small settlement of probably like $20 in the mail once corporate gives me a call. Well 2 weeks go by and I call Wendy&#39;s to make sure they were still planning on calling me and seemingly no one remembered me or my F&#39;d up sandwich I never got to eat. (Considering I still have the meal frozen in my freezer along with pics on my camera with the receipt, I wasn&#39;t worried) They of course once again gave me the run around about receiving a call for a settlement. 2 months go by (yes I still have the food in the freezer) and I&#39;m pissed. Not only did I get the run around for the 3rd time after I called, the manager had the nerve to tell me to bring in my 3 month old receipt and food. Upon doing so they &#34;lost&#34; my receipt and I was left with rotten food I paid $20 for and never ate. I let it go bc I wasn&#39;t getting anywhere with them. Well yesterday (and this why I wrote this review) my aunt went to the same Wendy&#39;s for chicken nuggets which were still frozen in the middle.. She did not go back for a refund and did not complain but %100 deserved a refund for the $ that was once again wasted on your store. Most people don&#39;t understand what it is like to carry an epi pen in a country where you can find dairy in all 6 sections of the food pyramid. I hope this review yelped you realize the importance of customer satisfaction."

Vini&#39;s did a great job of meeting my thin crust pizza desires.  A very zesty and quite delicious pizza which was at a near perfect thin crust thickness (when you are looking for a thin crust pizza).  My only major gripe with them is in terms of pricing, and that is why they did not get a five star rating.  I would probably be okay with there prices if it was a nice dine in location where I was getting served, but in terms of a delivery/take out place, the prices are a bit out of wack in my honest opinion.

It&#39;s a tiny nice pizzeria, no tables inside. Together with that, they serve variety of food: different pizzas (from thin crust to Chicago deep dish), sandwiches, burgers, pastas, salads and chicken wings!

Their staff is always friendly and quick. We usually come at night around 9-10pm to pick up a slice of a house special pizza with sausage, pepperoni, bacon and jalapenos.

We ordered a 20in Pepperoni pizza at 6:09 pm. We were then promised a delivery time of 45 minutes or less, which is about average for the area.

Unfortunately, that time came and went. We decided to call at 7:10 pm to ask for a status update on our order. The employee on the line stated that the order had been dispatched earlier and should arrive any second. Completely understandable for a busy Sunday night.

The wait continued... No sign of the driver for another 45 minutes. Once again, we decide to check for a status update at 7:55 pm. We were told that the order had been dispatched and should arrive any moment. 

Deja Vu anyone?!?

Pizza finally arrived at 8:00 pm. The delivery driver issued no explanation or apology of any sort. We finally had our pizza at least...

I wish the disappointment ended with the service, but unfortunately it continued with the food... Our pizza was delivered at room temperature, maybe slightly colder than that. The flavor showed alot of potential, but it was simply too hard to judge this pizza due to the temperature it was delivered at...

The silver lining that saved Vini&#39;s from a 1 star review was the $10.00 credit that was offered for our next purchase. Unfortunately, that is a bit on the weak side as far as discounts go, considering I had to fork over $35.00 plus tip for this experience.

I am an understanding man and thus will give Vini&#39;s Pizza one more chance to wow me. 

Maybe a slow weeknight will allow them enough of a chance to get their act together long enough for me to finally grant them a fair judgement...

Cheers,

I&#39;m not a fan of deep dish so I was looking for a thin crust with lots of cheese (I am from WI, after all). This did not disappoint. The cheese was ample and I don&#39;t think they could possibly put any more toppings on the pizza. 

My only gripe here is the cost-it&#39;s a bit pricey. I ordered a 12 inch, 1/2 Vini&#39;s house special and 1/2 Vini&#39;s deluxe. I&#39;m from out of town so I wanted to try both since they sounded so good. The price listed on the website for either of these as a 12 inch pizza is $21.80. Which in itself seemed expensive, but hey, it&#39;s on the company&#39;s dime. When I went to pick up the pizza, the total (including a bottle of water) came to just under $30.00. Seemed a bit steep, but the pizza was wonderful. I suppose it was worth it given the copious amounts of toppings."

I&#39;ve ordered pizza for takeout 2-3 times in the last month, which gives you an idea of the quality :). It&#39;s always hot and top quality- my girlfriend loves it, and she is a connoisseur!

One item to note- slices are $4, meat, veggie, or just cheese. If you like like 12 toppings, that may play to your advantage. I&#39;m a cheese guy, so I felt that was pretty steep for a (generously sized) slice of cheese pizza."

I will definitely get the lasagna again! The ribs were also very good. Good amount of sauce, and fell off the bone. 

A week later we came in for the largest supreme pizza. The crust is so cripsy yet fluffy and the ingredients combo was great. Definitely one of the best thin crust pizzas. 

Service the second time around wasn&#39;t so good though. We placed our order a half hour ahead, and when we came in they said it&#39;d be right out. &#34;Right out&#34; turned into 10 minutes, then another 15 minutes, then another 10 minutes.... aka they forgot to start our pizza and we waited an extra 30 minutes. They didn&#39;t admit it or apologize. That&#39;s poor customer service for sure, but I will be nice and cut them some slack and come back again.

We complained and they sent another pizza. Pizza arrived with a gallon of grease on top... it was a soupy droopy slobbery disgusting mess.

I go here a lot. I stockpile $1 bills specifically for this purpose. I think at the bank they believe I visit a lot of strippers, but I smell like sauce not perfume. I tell my wife I&#39;m going to Home Depot to get parts to fix things, but I really go to vinis, then eat the slice in the garage while I pretend to work.

One time she walked into the garage when my mouth was full. I quickly turned my back and held a sanding block to my ear, pretending to be on the phone.

The one negative that doesn&#39;t get much press here a lot is the high cost of extras on pizza, things like oh toppings...

  As a pizza place, I would say they get the food right, it&#39;s good pizza, no argument.  Is it anything special?  I would argue not really, it&#39;s competent but nothing standout about it, crisp crust and melty cheese with what seemed to be quality toppings.  Taste was good but again, not one of those &#34;how do they do it?!&#34; flavors.

  The thing that bugs the heck out of me about Vini&#39;s is that my pizza cost $38, yes THIRTY-EIGHT dollars for a 3 topping pizza.  I have never in my life paid that much for pizza.  $3 (minimum) per topping is a little high, IMO.  Looking at the menu, I thought, &#34;hmm, $23 bucks is about the going price for a pizza this size, no biggie.&#34; and then as I&#39;m hanging up the phone I have a hallucination that the cashier just quoted me a number somewhere around $40 for a thin disc of bread and cheese with a couple vegetables on it.

  I get it, quality costs extra, and I completely respect that.  However, I&#39;ve seen truly gourmet pizzas with truffle oil go for less in downtown Chicago, and this is not LaMadia Pizza.  I think I will continue to frequent Nino&#39;s, who&#39;s pizza is just as good if not better for about $15 (that&#39;s a 3d IMAX movie folks) less.  Lucky for Vini&#39;s they&#39;re pretty much in a different delivery area."

Over the past two years I have gradually tried almost all of the pizza joints in Palatine and the majority of the restaurants. Vini&#39;s pizza would be #1 on my list for thin crust pizza and #2 on my list of best food in Palatine (see my review of Capri Deli for #1).

Vini&#39;s Pizza offers the full arsenal of your average pizza parlor with a selection of appetizers you find at a lot of them. The mushrooms, in particular, are a crowd pleaser.

I&#39;m aware that most people are going to tell you to go to Lou Malnatis, but for thin crust it is almost always delivered underdone. If you really want a tasty thin crust hit up Vini&#39;s. The price is a touch higher than most of the pizza places in Palatine, but it is well worth it.

Since Vini&#39;s is close to our home and we pass it pretty often we thought we would give it a shot.  When I called to place our order the gentleman on the phone was very friendly and helpful.  When I explained that this was our first time trying Vini&#39;s he recommended asking the cashier to use the coupons on the box towards this purchase.  When we picked up our pizza we did exactly what he suggested and the cashier was more than happy to do so.  

We decided to try their 16&#34; regular crust with pepperoni, sausage and anchovies (just on one side as I am not an anchovy lover).  Their regular crust is a thin crust which is not usually my first choice in terms of pizza crust.  I gravitate towards a thicker crust although I have to admit that Vini&#39;s was very flavorful and I actually didn&#39;t miss the extra dough.  All the ingredients were very good including the sausage and cheese.  The thick layer of cheese on our pizza really made it stand out from the other ingredients.

Their jumbo slices and liter of pop are filling, delicious, and really hit the spot and only cost $4 of $4.50 for the special slice.  The layers of toppings on a special slice probably cost Vini&#39;s more than the extra .50, so it&#39;s a great deal for customers if you like jalapenos, pepperoni, sausage, and bacon on your pizza.  Try the pizzarito.  It&#39;s multiple-times better than the best calzone you&#39;ve ever had.  Beefarito is like taking the pizzarito and mixing it with a savory Italian beef sandwich. Also, Vini&#39;s pasta, wings, and salads are delicious.  Their salads are pretty healthy.  Try their Caesar dressing...it&#39;s fantastic!  I&#39;ll recommend my favorite specialty pizza: the Caesar Thin-Crust. 

Aside from the food, the service is great, too.  The employees work hard and know their trade.  The owners are especially nice and friendly.

We ordered a four topping extra large thin crust pizza and one order of jalapeno poppers for delivery.  The total not including tip was $48.11.  

When the delivery guy told me the price I thought he had the wrong order.  When I inquired about the price he told me that it was his first day delivering for Vini&#39;s and he had already asked the staff twice if they had the right price on several of the pizza&#39;s they gave him because the receipts were so expensive.  He was worried no one was going to tip him because of the prices.  I gave the guy $5 because it&#39;s not his fault.

They also forgot to print out a credit card receipt even though I gave them all of my credit card information over the phone.  The delivery guy had to call and they told him they&#39;d call him back cause they were busy.   I just ended up writing my credit card number on the back of the receipt after five minutes of waiting for them to call back which they didn&#39;t.

lunch special is a good deal, 4.00 buys you a nice slice of pizza and a huge bottle of pop or water 
lunch i think is considered 11-4; a real deal if your on a budget

pasta was not so great - good price but the quality is not

Garlic bread was really awsome, grilled chicken salad was guge for a small

my thought stay with the pizza - avoid the pasta

take out or delivery only"

March 9 2016- stopped in for dinner. Only one group at a table. Soon the place filled up. Had pizza, a couple of drinks. Pizza was awesome! Service was terrible. Only one waitress for the entire dining room. She did the best she could but the place was packed. My advice... If you walk in and they are busy, walk out or be prepared to wait for everything...even a refill on soda. We went to the bar to get a soda refill and were told to wait. Very damaging to the customer experience. I will think again about coming her when they are busy

If it&#39;s nice outside, sit out on their patio along the river side.  Pizza &amp; sandwiches &amp; salads along with the usual appetizers.  Not a huge beer list but good amount of choices so there is something for everyone if they&#39;d like to enjoy a brewski.

The service was very friendly and although the patio was a hoppin&#39; busy when we were there our server did a good job of keeping upbeat with a smile on her face.  While it may not have been as attentive as we would have liked, it was still good considering how busy they were on a Friday night.

We ordered the dough nuggets to start &amp; while they were good, they were cut a bit smaller than we have had anywhere else and there was barely only 2 small handfuls of them in the basket brought to our table - a bit on the skimpy side for the $6 price tag they were charging for a bit of fried pizza dough and a little cup of marinara.  We also had the thin crust meat-lover&#39;s pizza and the toppings were plentiful but not overwhelming, a good amount of cheese and the crust was nice &amp; crispy.  The sauce was okay, nothing amazing but certainly not bad either.

I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back to give their sandwiches a try as we&#39;ve heard good things from our friends on Yelp about them."

I ordered the fries mushrooms app, a thin crust margherita pizza and a glass of the house red wine.

The mushrooms are standard frozen pre battered veggies and as expected.

I was highly disappointed, with both the pizza and wine.

The pizza had some sad under ripe thin slices of tomato on a crust that was neither thin or thick, instead it had the worst characteristics of both - chewy, tough, doughy and flavorless.

The wine was a red blend and was barely drinkeable.

On the plus, the patio was gorgeous and a great place to hangout.

Subpar pizza and poor wine selection ruined this for me.

Choochs does have a wide selection of beers, but I didn&#39;t try any.  

There are much better places nearby for pizza, like Nicks and Village Pizza on Randall."

The staff is great: friendly, prompt. The environment and decor are great (the sign graphics are pretty awful though; could stand to hire a real professional for that). And I applaud the restaurant for being part of the revitalization of downtown Elgin. Additionally, there is a good selection of beers. I would go back for these reasons.

But the food just isn&#39;t special. The dough nuggets, which other reviews raved about, were underwhelming. Too chewy.

We had a pan pizza. Lots of dough on the bottom crust, no high edge, and not enough cheese. It&#39;s sort of the way they try to make pan pizza in California: you take a thin crust, and then just add a bunch of dough to the bottom, without changing anything else. I make better pan pizza at home, and I&#39;m shit for cooking.

We also tried a focaccia sandwich. The bread was dry, but the innards of the thing were pretty good. Decent chicken actually. Still, nothing to write home about, and they should pile it on more. I also agree with an earlier review that said the portions are weird. The standard sandwich plate is a sandwich and a small dish of coleslaw. Fries should just come with that, but instead you pay $1.00 extra and the fries replace the coleslaw. I don&#39;t really care that much about price, but it&#39;s still unusual.

I really want to like the restaurant, because the people seem nice. But I can&#39;t imagine this place lasting much longer. They were half-empty during Thursday primetime. I&#39;m actually surprised they&#39;ve made it three years - the place has that slightly awkward, empty feel of just having opened. Perhaps their patio is a big enough draw in the warm months that they can make it through the winter."

Place was fairly crowded but I found a table. Little did I know that they scheduled a presentation from the Elgin Historical Society and the place would end up packed. They really should have put up a notice about the event.

While waiting for my family to arrive I had to wait approximately 15 minutes for my server to visit the table to get my beer order. After I ordered it the rest of my family sat down. In another 15 minutes a gentleman who may have been the bartender delivered my beer (hint - when you order a craft beer bring a beer glass along).

After another 15 minutes (I&#39;m not exaggerating about these wait times) our server came and took our orders.

The three of us ordered ravioli and a caprese salad. While waiting for our food my family members also had to wait for a server to take their drink order.

The food came out and was fairly good. I then ordered another beer and more Cokes for my wife and daughter. They eventually did get their soft drinks but by the time I finished my meal my beer still hadn&#39;t arrived.

During the entire experience the presentation from the Historical Society was going on which prevented us from having any sort of discussion because of the volume. In addition a woman came out of nowhere and asked if we would share our table with a stranger. I&#39;m not sure if she worked at Chooch&#39;s or not. We respectfully declined because we were eating out as a family and were trying to have a discussion.

I was getting frustrated so my wife just told me to go grab a seat at the Dog Paws pub next door. She would close out the bill and join me there.

I guess my beer finally did get to the table but there was no one there to drink it. So I paid for a drink that I didn&#39;t receive. Hope someone there enjoyed it.

It was clear that the restaurant scheduled this event without taking into consideration the extra help they would need. As I mentioned before it would have also been nice if they would have posted a notice on the door that this event was taking place so folks like us could decide if it was the proper time for us to visit.

I have never received such poor service at a restaurant where a manager didn&#39;t eventually walk over  to apologize and explain what the issues were. The only person we spoke with was the young woman taking our orders who explained that she wasn&#39;t normally a server. I do have to say she was polite.

I guess  Chooch&#39;s is participating a pub crawl tonight. I hope they have the staff to cover it. I&#39;m certainly not going to be there."

Their appetizers are above-average to excellent. Dough nuggets are about the most sinfully good thing you can find south of the Wisconsin border. The deep-dish pizza is massively under-rated. It&#39;s not that oily cheese-fueled thing called &#34;Chicago style,&#34; but it&#39;s perfect for people who don&#39;t live in fear of carbs and want an alternative to thin crust that marries homemade bread with pizza toppings. Their focaccia sandwiches are, according to my wife, incredible. This is the restaurant TGIFridays goes to bed dreaming it could be. And the owner is incredibly nice, to boot.
Go here. Spend your money. If it isn&#39;t everything I described, then come back and try again. The greatest thing about this place is that no one is trying to whitewash their feelings with a disingenuous smile and twenty-three &#34;pieces of flair.&#34; It&#39;s dining how it should be...sharing time with those you are close to, want to be closer to, or just passing through your life.

Food especially pizza is all a question of personal taste and I&#39;m gonna be honest here the pizza was not all that great. It was thin crust sausage. The density of the crust was OK and if I was going to classify it, i&#39;d call it more NY style. Spicy sauce, light on the cheese...crumbled sausage.

Now the lunch Chipotle Chicken Focaccia sandwich was damn good. One of best Foccacia sandwiches I&#39;ve had. Served with a side of coleslaw, it was filling yet not wasteful. Had it not been a business meeting I would have tried one of the beer specials.

The wife and I returned to try their regular meals with her having the Ravioli and I the spaghetti both with meat sauce and side salads. My wife liked the Ravioli while the spaghetti was ok but nothing to  jump over fences about.

Over all the service was outstanding in each event but I&#39;d recommend going for the Lunch Special Focaccia Sandwiches...it&#39;d be nice if they materialized on the dinner menu.


The décor is great, warm and classy. My hat is off to both the owner and other business people of Downtown Elgin trying to restore the business district as well as add both culture and spice.


Good Luck"

With that being said, my wife and i visited last Saturday when he had Jazz singer Annalee Hooson and the Midnight sons performing on the back patio. it was very cold for a late July night, temp was in the 60&#39;s, but he can;t do anything about that. We ordered the Pizza nuggets as an appetizer, and my wife ordered a Chicken Parmesan Sandwich with Tater Tots and I ordered a Margherita Pizza. The food was very good, pizza was excellent, and her sandwich was really good as well. the chicken was fresh, battered and fried which you could tell and the pizza was all fresh ingredients.

Here is the draw back. The patio was very crowded that night because of the live jazz musician, who you should check out as well, ANNALEE HOOSON. There were only 2 waitress out there, which normally would be fine, but the kitchen is inside and up a set of stairs, so these 2 girls were running their tails off. The owner Michael helped out some by helping clear tables but he could have done more. Also on nights with live music he could probably have an additional buss boy on the patio, just clearing tables and refilling drinks, which would save the 2 waitresses a lot of stress.

Would I visit again, most definitely."

My own imposed rules for any review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Must order something unique each visit.
3. If they have any &#34;signature&#34; items on the menu, you must order a &#34;signature&#34; item at least once.
4. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Chooch&#39;s Pizzeria 

Location/Layout - 7/10:  Located on Grove, directly north of the River Boat and along the soon to be completed River Walk in Downtown Elgin.  The interior has been completely built out new for this establishment and sports a very clean and modern feel, along with a lot of charm.  The exposed brick walls and wood bar are very nicely decorated and compliment the overall theme.  There is a first floor dine in area along with an upstairs that is currently being used exclusively for private events.  Chooch&#39;s is currently building an outdoor pation/beer garden that will connect the restaurant to the river walk and allow an al fresco dining experience.  Parking may be the lone issue as there is street parking available in front but spaces are extremely limited and used by several other businesses in the area also.  The public lots are available within walking distance both to the north and south of the restaurant.   

Menu - 5/10:  The menu is by no means overwhelming and offers pizza, apps, pasta, sandwiches, and a limited salad and desert selection.  There are always weekly specials that may be unique offerings or combinations of current menu items.  While the menu is extensive enough to keep most patrons satisfied, they currently only offer their pizza in two odd sizes; thin is offered in 12&#34; or 15&#34; and the deep dish is available in 9&#34; and 13&#34;.  This can pose an issue when ordering for a large group or trying to split a pizza between more than 2 guests.  Additionally, they are in desperate need of a drink menu especially showing their beer offerings and pricing.  

Service - 6/10: Our servers are usually efficient and friendly.  They have always been knowledgeable about the menu when asked with the exception of not knowing all the available beer selection and pricing.    

Food - 7/10:  In full disclosure we have always eaten pizza when we have gone to Chooch&#39;s.  I am looking forward to trying other items at some point but since they are a pizzeria, this is why we have come to Chooch&#39;s.  Fortunately, the pizza is very good, with fresh toppings and a good cheese ratio.  The thin crust is thicker than standard Chicago style thin but is crispy on the bottom with a nice chew and breadieness to make it unique.  It is served table side on a pizza riser and is always piping hot.  

Drinks - 5.5/10:  Chooch&#39;s offers a full service bar area with mixers, beers, wine and soft drinks.  Unfortunately, they do not have a libations menu and prices are unknown unless you ask or wait for the bill. 

Overall Experience - 7/10:  Chooch&#39;s offers a solid selection and some very good pizza.  They are a great addition to the newly expanded downtown Elgin dining scene and are convenient to all the amenities such as the River Boat, Hemmens, and The Centre.  They offer a comfortable dining experience with a few TVs for viewing sporting events but will really shine when they are able to complete their patio and have a new River walk for patrons to enjoy."

Got a cheese, sausage, and green pepper pizza and it was just alright. Would never order the pizza again much better options in the area. 
BUT what we did order which were fabulous were the deep fried dough nuggets! They really were amazing and because of them, and them being made homemade we will be coming back to this place for a 2nd try we just won&#39;t be ordering the pizza."

And there is Chooch&#39;s. Not only do they use a Family Tradition Recipe for their Pizza. But it&#39;s also a true authentic Chicago taste too! 

Their atmosphere here is another mentionable. They have live music featuring local artists on Saturdays and also have lots of drinks specials too. 

This is the place where in the day, families can come and enjoy great family foods, and at night adults can enjoy a nice Martini with friends and unwind from the stresses of the work week. 

I give my recommendation to check this place out.

The service was crazy slow and we asked for no cheese on a pizza bc we were dining with two vegans and the pizza of course came out with cheese, waited an hour off the replacement and no comps at all.  Drinks also took 15 minutes to arrive. That&#39;s insane! I was a waitress for 4 years and if two people couldn&#39;t eat dinner with the others, I would definitely comp that food.  I am here on vacation and the environment was great, but that service was just some of the worst I&#39;ve ever experienced. She also charged is for an extra soda we didn&#39;t have at the end of all this.  Very disappointing to have spent money here at all."

I heard the pizza was great and that they had a gluten free option for the DH. Went with a group of friends and were seated right away. We had a server who didn&#39;t know up from down and I am sure she was just overwhelmed because they were BUSY. But... we all wanted separate checks and there should be a system for that (number, name, symbol, whatever...) our pizza took forever and yes, it was hot, real ingredients, and the gluten free was decent. The crust was really chewy (I am a Monical&#39;s fiend -- cracker for me all the way) so maybe it&#39;s a NY style thing?? Our friend waited at least 45 minutes after us for her pizza. I felt so bad for her. The MGR stepped in and apologized, but after almost 1 hour waiting for a check we almost dined and dashed. Probably should have. 

I think it&#39;s a great place to go for a casual lunch or early dinner when it&#39;s not so overwhelming to the staff. The ingredients were fresh, the salad was good and the beer selection had a few IPAs, which, they had no beer list; I had to walk to the bar to look at the bottles. Suggestion: create one in Word and get it printed. You can do two on a page and print them out. 

Clean, open and because of the high ceilings, exposed brick and wood/hard floor, it&#39;s going to be noisy.  Best of luck!"

The decor is great and creates a nice, welcoming feeling with interesting pictures on the wall. There were a few TVs to catch the end of the game, but the volume was low enough were actually able to have a conversation.

The food was excellent, and all homemade. Everything tasted very fresh. We ordered mozzarella sticks and were pleasantly surprised to find they&#39;d been hand-breaded - delicious. Chooch&#39;s only does a thin crust, made in-house, and it was great. The owner came out to talk to us and feedback, which is so important. 

The bill was very fair for two ($34ish), and included mozzarella sticks, a beer for each, and a 15&#34; pizza that generated enough leftovers for both of us. 

They had signs for a $5 weekday lunch special that includes a slice of pizza and either a soup or salad.

We were thinking a little more sauce and delivery as an option would have made this a five star review. Hands down, this has been the best thin crust in Elgin thus far.

Dan the owner says that he gets his fresh ingredients from the fancy schmancy JK lol he has a great sense of humor. 

Back to the cheese sticks....Home made, they cut the pizza cheese into little rectangles, their breading has the right mix of bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. 

The marinara sauce is also aaaahmazing. Fresh homemade, saucy with chunks of tomatoes. 

Just shared a focaccia chipotle sándwich with tater tots, margarita pizza (half with pepperoni) very good. Super good.

Sadly, it will be a while before we eat there again because of it. Here&#39;s the basic gist: 
Sat out side in June 2014 - beautiful patio on riverwalk. Waited at least 15 minutes to be approached by waitress who was less than enthusiastic. In fact, she didn&#39;t smile once while interacting with us the entire visit. Asked about the seasonal beer special and the brands of wine - her deadpan response was: &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;. Then after long pause, &#34;Well, I could go check if you want&#34;.

Sat out side in June 2014 - beautiful patio on riverwalk. Waited at least 15 minutes to be approached by waitress who was less than enthusiastic. In fact, she didn&#39;t smile once while interacting with us the entire visit. Asked about the seasonal beer special and the brands of wine - her deadpan response was: &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;.

Unfortunately, we were not allowed to sit outside because we were just two people, and they did not want to let us take a 4-top.  We must have visited at a bad time, because it took about 25 minutes for us to get water and the wine I ordered, even though there were wait staff standing around.   Our waitress was new and inexperienced but nice.  Our food came out before our water did.  Apparently there was some problem with the computer freezing up on the orders.  My penne rigate with meatballs was very good; the meatballs tasted homemade. However, the bread and salad came at the same time as the entree.   My husband ordered calamari and minestrone and they were o.k.   The people next to us ordered pizza, which looked good and they said it was good.  Their order of a second pizza got messed up, though.   Prices were reasonable for the portions we got.  The front of the house seemed overwhelmed in general; I hope they get it worked out because they were only about as busy as one would expect on a Friday night.

I thought the sauce was very good and the cheese to sauce ratio was just right. The pizza could use more seasoning, but a little crushed red pepper did the trick. The pizza prices are average, as our group of six ate for around $40. The waitress was friendly and mildly attentive. Overall it was a fairly good experience and I will be back.

The place is clean, beautifully done, honors the charachter of the space it occupies with its decor. I know the place is new, but the servers knew very little about the food. Pizza sizes turned out to be a mere 12&#34; and 15&#34;. No deep dish or Chicago style on the menu... Tried to order thick crust and was informed they were &#34; not set up for it yet.&#34; Ordered chicken finger appetizer, a 15 inch that was supposed to be extra cheese, pepperoni and bacon, and a 12 inch sausage/black olive for my kids. Appetizer arrived in a timely manner, pizzas out shortly after. Extra cheese wound up on the kids pie, when I pointed it out I was offered a beer, promptly denied by me with kids in tow. The pizza was at best bar quality, not really a product you&#39;d expect to find as the cornerstone of a pizza parlor. Crust super thin, sauce from a can, like an overpriced Tombstone, you know, like from your grocers freezer? The service was attentive and prompt, drink never went empty. I took some strain of pasta home for the Mrs.( penne?) which went unfinished. Until the dog got it (sound of Gordon Ramsay describing a dog&#39;s dinner echoing through my head). In the interest of fairness, I will dissect this review. The restaurant appearance- 5 stars. Service- 5 stars. Food quality and presentation- 1/2 star. Almost $60 dollar bill for a combined 20 inches of pizza, a pasta dish, and an appetizer that took 4 min to prepare in a deep fryer. I won&#39;t turn this into a commercial for competitors, but the owners would be well suited to order from some other nearby establishments, do an unbiased comparison, and ask themselves if they honestly think their product is remarkable enough to motivate people to brave downtown Elgin&#39;s poor parking and shady characters . You&#39;d better change it up and be a standout, or like Red Bar, The Hangout, La puesta Del Sol and Douglas Street before you become a fleeting memory of another one of Elgin&#39;s &#34; could have been &#34; ventures.

This particular location is very clean, always well staffed, and very efficient. The location is near to my home, so this is the Noodles I use most frequently, and I&#39;m glad it is nearby. On my most recent trip, I stopped in to use my free bowl/salad/etc. from a Yelp Elite event I attended, and they were very pleasant about that. I order various things when I go to noodles- but my favorites are the BBQ Chicken Salad (summer only usually) which comes with corn- delicious, the Chicken Ceasar Salad, and a Penne Pasta dish that is a bit spicy. I also always enjoy using the drink machines where you can &#34;create your own&#34;, and this Noodles location has one of those. Finally, I usually treat myself to one of the giant rice krispie treats that lasts me several meals- not too sweet, and very fairly priced.

I will definitely continue to go to this Noodles, and will probably be back more in the summer as I love the BBQ Chicken Salad they just brought back. The employees at this branch are efficient and friendly, which keeps me coming back again!"

Whoever think that this place is a good restaurant to eat noodles, they must have no idea how noodles are supposed to taste like. I can only speak for the two types of noodles they have in the menu. 

The Japanese and The Thai noodles. Whoever cooks in the back most definitely did not have the proper training to fry noodles. It just seems like they throw the noodles in the wok/pan and drop some whatever soy sauce they use and mix it with no care in the world. I can tell that they had the heat on too high because some of the noodle strands were burnt - and had no sauce! The sauce was supposed to coat each strand evenly - instead I ended up having heavy coated noodle strands and no sauce in some. The flavor is awful. 

The only good note was that the staff are friendly."

My issue is definitely with the service. Friendly enough I suppose. It&#39;s when my mom asked for a gluten free menu the lady taking our order that I took issue. She asked why she wanted a gluten free menu. Ok not so bad (I guess) but then the menu she gave my mom was difficult to read, even for my younger eyes. Without any explanation or further assistance, my mom was left to decipher the hieroglyphics. Had I not been there, she wouldn&#39;t have been able to get through the gluten free menu.

Many delicious dishes -- even the simplest buttered noodles are phenomenal!

It&#39;s one of our favorite places to eat --- and the fancy Coca Cola machine is an added bonus! My kids love picking out what flavor Coke or Lemonade they want to accompany their noodle dish.

The service is always friendly and fast. Looking forward to being a customer for many more years to come!"

There were like at least 6 people working and every table was covered in garbage and there was food on the floor. If they dont care about cleaning tables or the floor i can only imagine how they were cooking my food. I paid close to 10 dollars for an asian bowl that i was too scared to eat.

My own imposed rules for any Chain Restaurant review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Since the food should be the same everywhere, with the exception of regional items, the food category will only be judged on the quality of the expected food (i.e. temperature, consistency, and amount).
3. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Noodles and Company - Elgin

Location/Layout - 5.5/10:  Conveniently located on the Northeast corner of Bowes and Randall Road, adjacent to the Menards in Elgin.  The interior has a modern design and is very spacious.  The eating area is typically neatly kept as is the fountain area and counter.  Noodles and Company also offers al fresco dining during certain times of year directly in front of the restaurant.  The issues with the interior are that the tables are starting to have the Formica wear out which makes them feel sticky.  Additionally, there is always two log jambs that occur at this particular Noodles and Company.  First, is the fact that the very short order line starts immediately upon entering from the western facing main door.  The second back up occurs because Noodles now offers one of the new single, thousand flavor, Coke fountains which bewilders people like it is written in Latin and causes kids to make mad scientist concoctions that take upwards of 10 minutes to complete.  Unfortunately, the fountain is next to the order counter making the back ups at times horrendous.       

Service - 5/10: Service at the counter is usually efficient on the Noodles end.  Although some people stare at the order board like it is one of those 3D pictures from the mall.  Orders are almost always correct and are brought to your table, although we have had the number system fail us and confuse the delivery person on a couple of occasions.    

Food - 6.5/10: The food at this location is always hot and fresh.  In general this is more upscale quick service and is prepared on demand with tasty ingredients.  The combinations offer a great amount of variety and the addition of several salad, soup, and even sandwich options has created a very rounded product offering.  The individual protein options leave something to be desired in taste, texture, and quality when compared to the veggies and noodles.  Additionally, they do not always compliment the bowls very well and are a costly add on.  Pricing overall is very reasonable, with the exception of the proteins and some side items, and I feel that bread or something along side they noodles should be included and not charged extra.

Overall Experience - 6/10:  Noodles is a very good quick service option.  They offer above average fair, including libations for those looking to indulge, with a freshness that you can taste and see.  All this can be had at reasonable prices in a decent and clean environment."

I have tried 6 of the noodle dishes and my favorites are the Japanese pan noodle, pasta fresca, Indonesian peanut sauté, and the whole grain Tuscan linguine. The only bad thing is you have to ask for everything with no mushrooms. Other than that service is always friendly and quick and the restaurant is kept very clean.

I&#39;ve been to Noodles maybe twice before and it was coolio so....why not?

I ordered Thai Curry Soup with chicken and a cup for water. What elevated this to 4 stars for me was...they have sparkling water as an option from their super duper beverage machine. I HATE flat water. Used to be the opposite, but you just about can&#39;t see me with out a LaCroix or Pellegrino in my fist. Total joy. Then I noticed about 3 I repeat 3 fresh brewed iced tea options. Being that I don&#39;t drink soda- this was beverage option nirvana. 

We grabbed a table outside and out came my soup with a grilled chicken breast on the side...a little odd that they wouldn&#39;t just put it in the soup but I got over realz quick because no one died because of it. Soup was pretty much super delicious. I would go back and have it again and again. Fresh veggies, great balanced broth, lots of noodles."

They do have a few tables so you can eat there as well.  We called ahead for pickup last night  to give them a try and the food was ready in 10 minutes.

We tried the nachos with chicken, a chorizo gordita &amp; a dinner dish called &#34;Alambre con Queso&#34; - which was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese - very good &amp; the steak was perfectly seasoned and tender.  The dinner came with beans and rice which were decent, and also tortillas.  The menu did not say it came with tortillas but it makes sense that it would.  Since I didn&#39;t know it was included they gave me corn tortillas so if you prefer flour you will want to specify.  The nachos and gordita were also good.

Prices were in line with other local Mexican take-out places.  If you are familiar with the small shopping center at the corner of Chicago St (Irving Park) &amp; Shales - this place is located in the spot that previously housed two different, short-lived, pizza places.  I hope this place makes the cut!"

It&#39;s in a hard to find location. We came here with friends, but we would have had a hard time finding it if we didn&#39;t.

When my friend first brought me here, I didn&#39;t really have high expectations, but boy was I wrong! Ever since then, this is a regular in our work lunch rotation. 

When you first walk in, you see the guys working the grill and immediately smell all the awesome meat they&#39;re grilling up. There&#39;s booths in the front and then a bigger seating area in the back. It&#39;s kind of a sit down restaurant where there&#39;s a waitress but at the end you can just bring your check up to the cashier and tell him your table number.

While waiting for your food, they bring out some pretty good chips and two kinds of salsa. There&#39;s definitely a little heat on the red salsa. As for the food, I&#39;ve tried a good chunk of the menu offered here. Usually when I go to Chipotle or Qdoba, I&#39;m never satisfied with the amount of meat they put in my burrito. That&#39;s definitely not a problem at el norte. They definitely don&#39;t skimp on the filling. The burritos are packed with plenty of meat and cheese, almost bordering on too much meat (I never thought I&#39;d ever say that in my life!). The chicken a la coca cola is one of my favorite fillings. It&#39;s super flavorful and has a really good spicy kick to it. Another favorite item of mine is the torpedo burrito, which has steak, onions, cheese, and a fried egg stuffed in a burrito. 

They offer different variations of their burritos. Suizo means the burrito comes covered with melted cheese and some red sauce. El papi is basically a super sized burrito. The first time I was here, we thought el papi would be no problem for a group of young hungry guys. We were all defeated waving our white flags at the end of the meal. It was pretty much the size of my forearm and like I said earlier, it was jam packed with meat and cheese. It can easily be two meals worth of food. 

Overall, el norte has quality food for a meal that&#39;s under $10."

My family lived 2 miles away from this place for over 10 years and we never ate here until 2 years before we moved from Chicago to Denver. While Denver is a much better place to live than Chicago I really miss cheap and easy eats like this place. Tacos el Norte is just plain awesome. The food is fresh, cheap and so tasty! I really miss my $2 bean and Rajas (grilled poblano) tacos. It was spicy and so flavorful. Their enchiladas, nachos and burritos are so good. We left too much emotional baggage behind in chicago so we will probably not return, not even for a visit. But if time heals wounds and we did come for a visit back to Barrington/Lake Zurich you can bet that tacos el Norte would be a part of that visit. 

But anyone that lives within 15 miles of this place should try it, at least twice. Since the first time no one orders the right food anyways. Thanks and God Bless."

The service, ambience, and food were all executed well enough to make this dive restaurant one to remember and return to.

The Torpedo Burrito is amazing and highly recommended. Steak, cheese, onions, a fried egg (make sure that the yolk is runny) wrapped in a browned and crisp flour tortilla - amazing. 

The combination plate was also excellent. 

The restaurant was fairly busy when we were there yet service was fast. I will say that the waitress did provide us with one of the most unhelpful recommendations I&#39;ve ever heard in my life. My friend asked what was good there and what she would recommend and she proceeded to basically tell us what was on the menu instead of recommend dishes to us. We laughed it off though, and it&#39;s not going to detract from the 5 star rating I&#39;m giving this place since they really blew me away with their food. 

If the owners of this chain modeled all of their other restaurants (specifically the Palatine location) after this one and ensured that the service, ambience, and food quality were all of higher quality as this one is then I think they&#39;d make quite a name for themselves in the area."

The yelp app recommended this venue but it was interesting to find at night because it is jammed in the dark corner of a business strip. You will know if you are close by the volume of cars in the parking lot. The place was packed and most folks seemed pleased. The evening we were there (Saturday) there was a mariachi trio working the room. They did a great job too, tips much appreciated. There is a lot going on in regards to food options. You can work from the specials or you can work from the menu. The cool part is you can mix match as you please. So if you want to get three taco dinner but want one taco to have chorizo, one to have coca cola chicken and one to have whatever, you can totally get it your way. I like that kind of flexibility. From my brief single experience though, I would recommend what my wife did, skip the corn tortillas and get the coca cola chicken as a salad. A little healthier and the coca cola chicken is pretty darn good. Or another good option is to get one of the main burritos and split it. Most burritos these days are the size of a small baby anyway ;)"

You really don&#39;t have to go to a fancy-looking restaurant to enjoy tasty Mexican cuisine as this place really delivers on flavor, portion size, value, and satisfaction. Service is quick and friendly as well.

Tried the ribeye tacos, garlic shrimp, milanesa plate (with grilled onions), and burrito with ground beef on my visit. The ribeye tacos had tender cooked steak with tasty grilled onions that were matched with a touch of cilantro in addition to the usual taco ingredients. The garlic shrimp was nice and large with a tasty grilled flavor and served with creamy avocado. The milanesa was very flavorful and tender with enough meat for two meals. The burrito was large and flavorful (even without sauces). The crispy chips and fresh salsa that came with the meal helped make this a very enjoyable experience.

Everything about the visit was very satisfying, I will definitely come back when I&#39;m in the area."

I was not disappointed ! This place reminded me of some of the out of the way locals only Mexican restaurants I found in L.A. Great food and great service. I would stay away from the house margarita made with what tasted like roses lime juice, no Bueno!
Skirt steak was amazing and the Chile Rellano was pretty darn good! Less than 20$  total and out the door!"

Deceivingly large space as its located in the very corner of an obscure strip mall.  its almpst like an exclusive underground club.   all the other businesses were closed as I parked my car.  this place must be popular i figured as i entered at 5:30pm -as all the spots were filled in the parking lot.  

free chips and salsa yum.  good sauces.  i decided to challenge the burrito grande with al pastor. lets just say the pastor told me to tap as he was not to be conquered.  we also had a sope with al the pastor again.  (that in itself was enough food for one of us).  all delicious.  

oh, and by the time we left, all the tables were occupied.  if i&#39;m in the area again, I&#39;ll go for the winner."

Salsa: very watery
Tamales: Ordered 3, all the tamales pulled apart as we opened the husks.  The masa was clumpy and sticking to the husks.  These were either under cooked or left over from the previous day.
Enchiladas: Ordered chorizo with mole sauce, the chorizo was burned, not well done...burned.  The mole was bland and disappointing.  

Overall, the best thing on the plate were the beans, which probably came from a can.  I have only one lingering question: How can a mexican restaurant screw up mexican food?  Oh...I weep for &#34;los gringos ignorantes&#34;.

Although everything was very tasty, and I might go back if I were in the area, I didn&#39;t think it was quite as spectacular as some of the reviews made it out to be. 

We sat in the room on the far left of the restaurant because the main room to the right of the entrance was full. However, our service was kind of slow, and our waitress never brought us our waters (we think she thought we only wanted the margaritas instead of both). I got my usual steak tacos (I get them at every Mexican restaurant we go to), and they were mighty tasty, probably Top 20ish of all the tacos I&#39;ve ever eaten. My husbands fajitas were a little smaller than most restaurants, but it was sufficient. Their margaritas though were very tasty, we got the strawberry ones and I would highly recommend them. 

The overall ambiance of the environment was well themed with murals on the walls, and such. But the fluorescent lighting was not quite right, would have liked a little warmer light (more yellowish). It&#39;s personal preference.

Although our service was a little slow, and we never got our waters, this is definitely a place to check out if you&#39;re in the area and looking for good Mexican food."

They recently did a remodel and have an entire new room with tables.  This place is already good-sized but it&#39;s almost always busy when I visit  So good for them for being that busy. 

The free chips and salsa with lunch are a nice perk but the salsa is not fresh and the chips are just regular chips out of a bag.  I&#39;ve tried a few things and I do like the Coca-Cola chicken.  But on the whole, the food here is too greasy for me.  I&#39;ve even tried a few of the veggie dishes and the grease just drips off them. Meh.

The coca cola chicken is the perfect balance between sweet and spicy and very moist.  The burritos contain a generous portion of meat, cheese, and guacamole (extra).  They are some of our favorites burritos that we&#39;ve had anywhere - my fiance really wants to figure out how to make coca cola chicken like they do!

We get the burrito with guacamole and it still comes out to around $7 with tax, which is pretty hard to beat.  Tacos El Norte is incredibly affordable but still really cute.  The walls are nicely painted with murals.  The service is incredibly fast - we had our burritos within 5 minutes of ordering.
