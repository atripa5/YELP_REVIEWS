Toom and her family are what makes this place feel like I&#39;m eating at my mom&#39;s house (if she were Thai). The atmosphere is not spectacular but it feels cozy. And the location is in the heart of Downtown Elgin. 

My favorite dishes are the chicken pad Thai (with extra peanuts and a little spicy) and pineapple fried rice with beef - the pineapple give it a hint of sweet and the cashews the crunch. 

Thank you, Toom for being you and caring so much about your guests and your food."
toom-toom-thai-restaurant-elgin,Matthew H.,NMF_y2WVfp5ByB6fBFkHXA,"Elgin, IL",0,1,0,0,11,YrQdKh6gjEziIweSkiyc3Q,5.0,2016-09-21,"To start, I&#39;ve lived in Northern Thailand for a short period and loved the food over there.  Short of flying to Thailand, Toom Toom is authentic as it gets and is absolutely delicious and perfect in every respect.

For take-out (or dine-in for that matter) I strongly suggest The Bangkok Curry Noodles, with chicken -- even if you&#39;re not a fan of curry (like myself).  Medium is usually the perfect amount of heat for your average customer -- enough for you to feel it, but not where you&#39;re tearing up every bite.  The noodles are perfect, and the coconut milk/red curry/heat balance is a marvel to behold.
As a second dish to that, I recommend their Thai fried rice.  I know, it&#39;s just fired rice, right? -- Wrong.  It is the perfection of what fried rice should be: not greasy, light, perfect flavor and fresh veggies.  Awesome with tofu, if that&#39;s your thing.
As far as typical favorites, their Pad Thai and Pad Si Ew is spot-on, as well as their appetizers to include Pot stickers, Crab Rangoon, Egg rolls and Spring Rolls -- However, everything is great.

If you dine-in, do yourself a favor and order the Tom Kha Soup, with either chicken, shrimp or tofu.  It is an absolute work-of-art and enough for one person as a meal, or shared ... but why share?  Tom Kha Soup!  Do it!

As far as the chef, she&#39;s a spunky little Mae with a thick accent, and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s her daughter working there as well; equal accent.  For all I know, they could be from Arkansas or something, but I&#39;m will to bet they&#39;re actually from Thailand and are simply cooking awesome food, with love, from their home.  

I&#39;ve read a review where the OP alleged they witnessed her come from the kitchen, after the customer complained about his food -- and she then proceeded to yell and berate the man.  I can only hope this is true, because I have no doubt she&#39;s the type of person to go over blows with some American over what is authentic or not.

Now, personal story of mine -- Once upon a time my family and I were eating there late, about 9 p.m. we were finishing up, with a few other customers in the place.  My children were kind of playing in the lobby when the chef came around the corner, from the kitchen and started laughing and playing with the kids, who were curious about the kitchen.  So, she took them back there to see everything.  I felt a little embarrassed that the kids were bugging her, but she basically told me to be quiet and come back to he kitchen, too.  You could tell she was very proud.

This of course left me in a pickle: This is one of my favorite places, yet I&#39;ve certainly seen the back of a lot of Asian-themed restaurants, and it certainly hasn&#39;t been pretty.  So I didn&#39;t want to offend her, but at the same time, I didn&#39;t exactly want to peel back the veil of what happens in the back of the house, either.

Well, she insisted, and my wife and I stepped back there and &#34;Wow&#34; is all I can say.  It was immaculate and easily one of the cleanest commercial kitchens I have ever seen.  

My respect for this woman is up there.

Oh, and for the love-of-God, order a Thai Tea, iced or hot.  Don&#39;t be the noob who orders a Coca-Cola and is served, disdainfully, with a warm, unopened can ... 
And Tom Kha Soup!"

I love getting the Basil Fried Rice with medium spice. Chef Toom is great at helping you decide just how spicy you want your food to come our. 

When you order lunch they start your meal with a Chef&#39;s choice appetizer. I have had Pot Stickers, Cucumber Salad (my favorite) and Spring Rolls. Everything is delicious!

Just recently they started serving wine and beer. Limited selection but what they have pairs perfect with Thai food."

So hard to find authentic Thai and this place has it. You walk in and first greeted by warm Thai grandma who is prepping ingredients like chili peppers, cilantro, lemon grass etc. the food is outstanding, fresh ingredients and bold flavors. When you ask for hot, its atomic hot!!  Try the cucumber salad, crunchy and sweet and great to balance out the spicy foods. Beef salad was great too, just the right balance of salty, sweet and sour.

The atmosphere of the restaurant was cute and the decor was nice. We were seated quickly and our waitress was nice. Unfortunately, the food did not match or meet the atmosphere of the place. Its not that the food looked unplesent, it just lacked flavor and being a Thai food lover, knew that this food was missing its usual Thai spices. Dumplings were too small to even enjoy them. Crab rangoon needed more filling. Panang curry was on the sweeter side and did not have enough meat portions. The holy basil was just a plate of noodles with a little bit of sauce. Thai iced tea was good, but again, I&#39;ve had better. Not sure I would come back here."

While we are not experts on Thai food by any stretch, the Cashew Chicken was really good. It could have used just a dash more flavor, but it was good. I was envious of the Pepper Steal ordered by the other person in my party. It was spiced to order and was awesome.

Positives:
Tom yum soup was very flavorful 
Crab Rangoon was filled with real crab meat not the imitation kind
Very reasonable prices 
Lots of food for the money!

Negatives 
Food favors the spicy side. I ordered medium spicy on everything and I felt it was a little warmer than medium

The menu says the basil fried rice has egg, Thai peppers, garlic and basil - there were no Thai peppers in sight however it was FULL of carrots and broccoli neither which I had any need for and so I spent quite a bit of time picking out the unwanted veggies. 

Soup does not come with a side of white rice. I was very disappointed in that as I have never had Tom yum soup without white rice in it before"

Looks like a family run restaurant, they are pretty much open only during lunch hours. Decor looks good here and server was really friendly and helped us with our decision.

Three of us had gone for lunch - all of us had the lunch special, which is one entree with the side of appetizer of the day. The appetizer of the day was Egg Vegeterian Roll. The other two had basil chicken with rice - medium spicy and stir fry entree with rice - spicy (which came with the roll - 1 pc). I had the pad kee mao with chicken - spicy which was really good, but I substituted roll for CRAB WONTONS - 2pc, which must say was the best thing I had there. If you have never tried CRAB and want to do so for the first time, I do suggest this appetizer ( it&#39;s just like wonton filled with string cheese). 

I would definitely say my dish tasted the best :p. But, I think basil chicken wasn&#39;t as appealing as it sounds and it&#39;s definitely not spicy for my taste. The stir fry on the other hand was Ok - pretty good. We then had the THAI CUSTARD for dessert - which definitely is not as sweet as I wanted it to be but it was GOOD. Considering it was made from coconut milk, pumpkin and some other veggie server said, the best part of that was it was made after we ordered. So it was HOT. Loved that.

The only odd thing that I comment is, server didn&#39;t really ask if we wanted water with/without ice, she just brought three glasses with ice. Second, I thought since entree comes with a side, both will be brought together, but appetizer was brought first, the sauce that came with it was both sweet and spicy - more on the sweeter side. It didn&#39;t go well with my dish but I had it  separately anyway :D. At the end of the day I look back and think it was really satisfying meal as well. :)"

I&#39;ve probably only written 2 or 3 bad reviews on Yelp. I know how hard it is to run a restaurant, but my experience was AWFUL. The worst restaurant experience ever!!

To start the service was really, really slow.  I might understand if they were slammed, but when we arrived we were the ONLY table (8 people) occupied in the place.  It took 15 minutes to get our green tea. It took another 15 minutes to get our egg roll appetizer.  Others at the table who ordered other appetizers didn&#39;t get their orders for nearly an hour!!

When our entrees FINALLY began to arrive (45 minutes after ordering), each order came separately, sometimes arriving 5 minutes between each one.  It was like were eating in some weird round-robin format.

I ordered a Pad Thai dish with chicken, which was recommended by the waitress, who was very nice, if not very slow in her service.  When it arrived, it didn&#39;t look great, but I was hungry, so i was going to try it.  With the first bite, I realized that the food was cold.  The noodles didn&#39;t seem to be fresh, the chicken didn&#39;t seem right, and the flavors were rather bland and muted.

By this time, I was done with my dish and this restaurant, so I told the waitress that I didn&#39;t like my dish.  She asked why and I explained it.  She then nicely asked if I wanted another plate or dish, but by then I just wanted to leave, so I sent it back with her.

About 5 minutes later, the &#34;owner&#34; came out with a very aggressive attitude and asked why I sent my dish back.  I explained again, but instead of the usual restaurant response of an apology and let me take that off your bill, he said that my &#34;critique&#34; was odd, because everyone loves their Pad Thai.  He then went to question if I even knew what good Pad Thai was.  (Lovely, right?  What a great guy...NOT).

He stormed away and I thought that we were done.  Our table got up and walked to the register to pay.  Obviously, I wasn&#39;t going to have to pay, right?  WRONG!!  The owner would NOT take the AWFUL dish off my bill and demanded that I pay the entire bill.  He then proceeded to chastise me about how rude I was and that I didn&#39;t know what I was talking about.  At that time, my fellow diners joined in to defend me and asked him why he was being so rude.  He became even MORE defensive...the sweet waitress then jumped in and attacked us for not liking the food. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! 

Nevertheless, I paid the bill and then wrote this review.  

I would recommend that YOU NEVER EVER EAT HERE, but instead walk up the street to a much better and nicer Thai restaurant, Bangkok House  http://bangkokhouse-il.com/"

Long story short--patron&#39;s meal comes out cold and poorly seasoned, and within one bite patron is done.  Tells the waitress he&#39;s unhappy, sends it back (all very calmly, i might add). Several minutes later, the owner comes out, questions the patron and proceeds to tell him that he must not know what he&#39;s talking about, that EVERYONE likes his Thai food.  Needless to say, this escalated, as the patron was unhappy with such an immature response from the owner.  It continued to the point of checking out, where the owner insisted that the disgruntled patron pay for his meal, you know, &#34;because it costs money to make the meal and you ordered it...&#34;, even exchanging very personal barbs with the patron for not liking his food.

If this owner had any shred of decency and customer service, he should&#39;ve responded like ANY OTHER RESTAURANT OWNER ON THE PLANET--comp the meal, apologize and invite them back again for another chance.  Instead, he was petulant, sarcastic, rude and childish as he argued with the patron all the way out the door.  NEVER will enter the door to this place again-- I actually said to the owner several times, &#34;You understand, right, that you can&#39;t treat customers this way?

I would stop by here again if nothing else is open, otherwise Toom Toom has a hard time comparing to other, good,  restaurants in the area; its just &#34;meh&#34;. I also suggest they get their plumbing problem, and resulting smell, fixed right away; nothing say &#34;yum&#34; like fresh sewage smell hitting you in the face as you walk in the door."

M&#39;lady and I were dying for some Thai. We moved to the area back in January from NYC and only recently heard about Toom Toom. Packed up the tiny lady and made a plan to have an early dinner (5pm) that Friday night. &#34;Do you think we&#39;ll need reservations?&#34; / &#34;Nah, it&#39;s early enough that it shouldn&#39;t be too crowded!&#34;

Total overstatement. We were the only folks there. Granted it was early -- again, 5pm -- but plenty of other places seemed busy on our drive over there. That doesn&#39;t deter us, though. We figured everyone else must be at a Bennigan&#39;s or some other nonsense, drinking Miller Genuine Draft and eating buckets of deep fried silliness. But I digress. More Thai for us.

We&#39;re greeted by a girl who&#39;s probably 8 years old, who proceeds to introduce herself as our waitress, grabbing three menus. M&#39;lady and I kinda laugh, &#34;aww, that&#39;s cute,&#34; and follow her to our table, expecting, well, &#34;a real waitress&#34; to show up at some point. The Tiniest Waitress brings us water. The Tiniest Waitress eventually takes our order. It&#39;s worth stating that the entire time we&#39;re there, she&#39;s the only person we see, kinda like some Peter Pan / Neverneverland restaurant experience. 

M&#39;lady ordered the Pad Si Ew and I ordered the Sauteed Garlic with Tofu. While we were waiting -- I&#39;ve noticed atleast one other person make this mention, over a month apart from our visit -- we both detected a strong odor of cleaning products fused with what I&#39;d describe as &#34;light sewage.&#34; M&#39;lady theorized it could be a plumbing matter. I wouldn&#39;t even state it out of fear of being alarmist, but since we&#39;re not the only ones who noticed -- again, a month apart from the other reviewer -- I think it&#39;s worth stating. That&#39;s a bit of an appetizer detractor in my book.

The dishes left a lot to be desired. Highly salted, lacking any sort of freshness inherent in Thai cooking. Despite referencing different sauces for each of our dishes, m&#39;lady and I both concurred the sauces were highly reminiscent of barely doctored soy sauce. To add insult to injury, my &#34;sauteed garlic&#34; used air-dried minced garlic, not fresh garlic. Ridiculous. 

All red flags, homeys. I left a good tip for The TIniest Waitress, &#39;cause she did her best, but all-in-all, WTF? Amongst the worst Thai I&#39;ve eaten, period."

BUT! It&#39;s not just about the food but the overall experience.

My wife and I both enjoyed our dishes. It&#39;s not a 4 or 5 star place for the following reasons in my humble opinion. 

1. They don&#39;t serve alcohol.

2. When we were there they must have been doing something with the toilets or some kind of special cleaning because it smelled funny. I can&#39;t see this being a permanent smell but this was my experience unfortunately.

3. We like our food spicy and I asked for the for the food to be &#34;thai&#34; spicy but it was kind of &#34;white people&#34; spicy. I am white so maybe they thought I couldn&#39;t handle it but it wasn&#39;t spicy at all.

The prices are also very reasonable."

They have lunch specials that looked good, although that isn&#39;t what we ended up getting. We got chicken satay and summer rolls for appetizers and both were good. In fact, I&#39;d say the chicken satay was great. Often it is rubbery and overcooked and I think this was done perfectly. The summer rolls were fine.

We split a main dish, which was not a problem at all for the waitress. We got yellow curry broth soup and it was nice and spicy.

I&#39;d recommend Toom Toom for Thai food. Service was fine, nothing outstanding. We didn&#39;t have to wait like some of the other reviewers here, but we were there at 1.30 in the afternoon and there were only two other tables of people."

The food was really good, but our main gripe with this place is that we read that they had lunch specials both on Yelp and on the menu - BUT the lunch special is that you pay the full price for an entree and get the free appetizer of the day.  Now, if the appetizer was a spring roll, dumpling, etc. I may not have minded so much, but the appetizer of the day was a cucumber salad which consisted of a tiny dish of about 1/2 cucumber cut into pieces with a sugar water like dressing on top.  The service was kind of slower, so I would recommend going here for lunch only if you have some time.  Other than that, the food was good and I&#39;d eat here again - but this time I&#39;d know upfront that there really is no lunch special to be had here."

The bad: Price
The ugly: Lights

Let me start off by saying that the only reason I ended up here was because White Pearl unexpectedly took the night off and I was in the mood for Thai during my short visit to Elgin.  

I don&#39;t know what it was, but the lighting seemed really harsh when I had dinner here on Saturday night.  Like a bare bulb ambiance.  That aside, the food was actually really good.  The Thai Iced Tea was good.  I ordered the Bamee and the menu provided a choice of beef, chicken, tofu or shrimp for $9.95.  I asked if they had pork and the waiter said he&#39;d check and give me pork if they had it, otherwise I&#39;d go with chicken.  So I was in luck since I was served my dish with pork.  I was disappointed with the type of noodles (thick lo mein instead of thin egg noodles) in this &#34;bamee&#34;, since I was hoping for the Thai style and not this substituted free style dish.  Perhaps I should have known when this dish didn&#39;t have BBQ pork as the default on the menu.  That aside, the dish was good with this noodle in it, but on the plain side as there was really only noodles, pork and bean sprout.  The disappointment doesn&#39;t end there, unfortunately.  

When I got the bill, my Bamee was now $12.95.  I assume it&#39;s because of the pork?  I don&#39;t see why that would cost more and I probably would have gone with another meat if I had known about this price hike.  I took an extra star off for this lack of communication.  That aside, our waiter was friendly and attentive.

Overall: I just felt like it was an unjustified high priced Thai food experience."

We arrived just a couple minutes after 6 p.m.  We were seated &amp; glasses of water were placed on the table.  Then we waited.  And waited.  It became obvious the girl who seated us was also the ONLY server.  I don&#39;t know if they were busier than usual for early on a Monday evening or what but there were people at 8 tables (including us): 5 tables were just couples, 2 tables had 3 people &amp; one table was a group of 6.  She didn&#39;t even stop by to see what we wanted to drink.  15 minutes pass &amp; she finally comes over to take our order.  I ordered hot tea &amp; we chose some dumplings as an appetizer since we were starving.  We ordered our entrees at the same time since we weren&#39;t sure how long it would be for her to come back &amp; take that order.  I chose the Pad Kee Mao (big noodles, chicken, egg &amp; veggies in a spicy Thai Basil sauce) &amp; the Hubs had the Kao Na Moo Yang (Thai-style grilled pork w/rice that also comes w/a vegetable soup).

Then we waited some more.  15 minutes pass &amp; she finally bring my hot tea.  There are still no napkins or silverware on our table.  Then we wait some more.  The Hubs has said several times by this point he wants to leave.  The only server is bustling about taking care of all the other tables, bringing out delicious smelling food to everyone else.  She never once makes eye contact with us so we can get her attention (short of maybe leaping out &amp; grabbing her as she whisked by) &amp; she never once checked on us (what was there to check on except the status of how my hot tea was getting cold?) or apologized for the delay.  At 7 p.m. another girl appears!  Hooray!  Her shift must have started at 7 &amp; at least now there were 2 servers to work the restaurant.  At 7:10 the 2nd server comes over to fill our water &amp; the Hubs asks her to check on our order.  I tell her we&#39;ve been here an hour. 2nd server says oh-my-goodness, she&#39;s so sorry &amp; she&#39;ll check.  1 minute later the 1st server comes out with our dumplings.  2 minutes after that our entrees appear.  GRRR.  1st server never once acknowledges the delay or apologizes.  I know it&#39;s not her fault but some sort of acknowledgement would be appreciated.  The 2nd server checked on us while we were eating &amp; she boxed up our food when we were done.  As she took the check she again apologized profusely for our long wait.  The 2nd server was great.  The 1st server - I know she was busy &amp; overwhelmed but she needs to work on her customer service skills.  Because of this we have no intentions of coming back to dine in but since the food was damn good (see below) I would order take-out from them in the future.  It would have been nice for someone to maybe offer us a free dessert or something or comp part of our meals, but alas no such offer occurred.

Okay, now to the food.  The dumplings were quite tasty, but it was $6 for 4 small dumplings.  The Hubs entree was exactly as described - just 1 cup of rice, the Thai Pork (I kid you not it was only 1/2 cup of little grilled pork strips, they had a nice taste &amp; were tender but they were totally COLD!  The rice was still hot.), the veggie soup it came with was amazing &amp; it was a big bowl.  The Hubs entree was $12.95 - quite overpriced considering how little meat it came with &amp; since it&#39;s only accompaniments were the rice &amp; soup (which is how the menu described it, so we weren&#39;t expecting more ingredients, just perhaps more meat?).  My meal was only $10 &amp; it was a huge plate with tons of chicken &amp; veggies &amp; noodles &amp; the most amazing spicy Thai Basil sauce.  Yummo.

The inside looks nice, deep red painted walls with a couple bright yellow lantern light fixtures above &amp; some brightly colored scarves hanging from the ceiling.  I did find it rather odd &amp; in poor taste that the daily specials were printed on regular paper &amp; taped to various walls.  Really?  Such a nice looking place inside &amp; you just tape white printed paper to those nice red walls?  How about you invest in a nice ironwork framed big chalkboard or something &amp; place it up from for people to see when they come in?"

1.  There was a distinct smell of sewage and strong cleaning agents hat was overpowering in the restaurant.  There was no way I could sit there and try and have dinner with that smell.

2.  When we sat down, we asked the waitress for two wine glasses as we had brought a bottle.  She said they are not BYOB anymore but they don&#39;t serve alcohol either.


I was really disappointed that we could not stay and try the food, but that smell was really gross.   Hopefully they will fix that problem soon.  If they do, we&#39;ll definitely give it a try."

I ordered potstickers, Tom Kha and Crab Bamee. The appetizer and soup were the star of the show for me. I read and reread these reviews after going here. Am I missing something??? The entree was not good, at all. It was missing the peanuts as described on the menu. It was also lacking flavor and temperature. The crab meat was just not good in it. The Tom Kha was tasty. I added shrimp and got three very small pieces. I would recommend adding no meat to it because it wasn&#39;t worth the money for meat. The flavor of the broth was excellent though. The potstickers were very good. They had a crispy outside and a lot of great flavor. I was put off by the portion cup of sauce given, but they were right. It was all I needed. 

All in all, I would go here again, but only for appetizers and soup. The entrees were just not nearly as good as expected."

We always order eggrolls and springrolls (called summer rolls here) as a test. We also ordered cucumber salad based on the reviews.

Our range of entrees included some that were mild, and others that were medium. As I ordered by phone, the person on the line pointed out ingredients that may cause allergies or be of concern for vegans, e.g. &#34;ok that there are eggs in the pad Thai?&#34;

So, I decided to go on a Saturday to celebrate my birthday lunch.  Toom Toom Thai is located right on the river.  GREAT LOCATION!  It&#39;s a quaint, yet colorfully Thai restaurant with a VERY welcoming owner, Chef Toom.

Chef Toom was very happy to see us when we came in and we got seated immediately.  We had lunch midday, so, it wasn&#39;t crowded.  My husband and I ordered the Pad Kee Mao and the kids had a bowl of noodle soup with tofu, which they split.  

We also ordered an appetizer of their Summer Rolls because I LOVE fresh spring rolls. YUM! I was not disappointed! It was so yummy and the presentation was very good!  I love to take pictures of food and the Summer Rolls made a good subject!

Then, our main meals came out.  I have had Pad Kee Mao at other Thai restaurants and usually they do not have the big noodles cut up as small as they did at Toom Toom Thai.  BUT, that&#39;s the good thing. It made the dish easy to eat and it was very delicious.  JUST the right amount of spice(we asked for it medium spicy) and it was very yummy!

Would I come here again?  You betcha!! :)  I want to try their noodle soups and curries. :)

The lighting is a tad dim and it&#39;s an old building but it has its charm and almost feels café/bar like. We looked over the menu and decided on some generic Thai fare to give us a sense of the place. There were only a few other tables in the place but the customers looked happy!  It took a bit of time to get our food and the wait was worth it! I got the cashew chicken which was flavorful and delicious, and my other half got the tofu pad thai which was equally as mouthwatering! I don&#39;t know much about Thai food to compare it, but I know that this place is awesome and I most certainly will be back. They have an extensive menu that offers lots of options for the meat and non meat eater.  

The staff is also very friendly and polite, which is a big plus!  If you&#39;re in the area and are craving Thai definitely give Toom Toom Thai a shot!"

The Tom kha soup was salty so I would not recommend this item. The portions for the appetizers and soup are small and not share-able. For appetizer, I go the chicken satay which was not flavored well but was tender. I got a Pad Ke Mao which was good.  I, also, tried the Bangkok curry which was okay but could be better with a creamy sauce. Service was good but  the place had only two other tables. Shredded basil chicken noodles didn&#39;t look very appetizing but it did taste okay."

We tried the Panang curry with tofu (ordered it &#34;spicy&#34;).  This was quite a tasty, flavorful dish, served with white rice.  We also tried noodles with crab and sprouts, which was very fresh, although not as flavorful as the Panang curry.  

For dessert we tried the purple rice with banana pudding, which was surprisingly good.  The purple rice was not individual rice, but a gooey mass (a tasty gooey mass), with sliced bananas and warm sauce on top.  I had been skeptical of this dish because I was expecting some ready-made banana pudding, but I had to amend my thinking on this one.  Unfortunately it was the other way around on the sticky rice and mango.  While the sticky rice was perfect, the mango was hard and not ripe.  I wish the waitress had warned me that the mango was not in season and therefore not soft and juicy when I ordered and not when she set the plate down on the table.

I plan on returning when I&#39;m back in the area."

Akina&#39;s is the Thai restaurant that used to occupy this space. And it was far, far better than Toom Toom. I&#39;ve had Toom Toom twice now -- once as carryout, once dine-in -- and was disappointed both times. This is a shame, because I really wanted to like Toom Toom, the owner seems like a nice lady, and downtown Elgin can use all the decent restaurants it can get. But this place is just too inconsistent.

When my husband and I dined there, we were seated right away, but we had to wait a long time for anyone to come and take our order. Then we had to wait a long time for the food. And frankly, it wasn&#39;t worth the wait. The pot stickers tasted like frozen ones you can buy at the store and heat up in the microwave. I&#39;m almost positive they weren&#39;t made on site. No flavor, just bland and &#34;meh.&#34; The chicken satay was dry and overcooked. My meal, Bangkok curry noodles with tofu, wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t great either; for some reason, the flavors just didn&#39;t mesh well together. My husband got the ginger chicken, which he said was good, but the portion was surprisingly small, and he was still hungry after finishing it.

I&#39;d be willing to try Toom Toom again to see if it improves; I think it has potential; but for now, I&#39;m not a fan. I think this restaurant needs to focus more on the quality of its ingredients and attentiveness of the wait staff."

I ordered the red curry which is my favorite, but that day it was HORRIBLE.  There was absolutely no flavor.  I guess the fact that the color of it wasn&#39;t even red should have tipped me off...it was more green.  Perhaps they made green curry instead of red and marked the container as red curry.  We also had ordered another staple...the Panang curry.  Now that looked more like red curry, but again completely lacking in any flavor.  The vegetable soup wasn&#39;t great either.  Had a weird taste and left an even weirder after taste.  Even the thai fried rice was not good.  How do you mess up fried rice?

This used to be one of our favorite Thai places to eat, but not anymore...and that&#39;s such a shame."

First off, the owner Toom was the most gracious hostess and by far the sweetest woman ever. Her son and daughter make up the highly atttentive waitstaff and are equally helpful suggesting menu options they enjoy on their Mom&#39;s menu. Everything we had was delicious and authentic! I would highly recommend their Tom Yum soup if you&#39;re in the mood for something spicy.

Their menu is very comprehensive, and they are very willing to substitute, and make accommodations for special dietary restrictions.

I have never had poor service here.  This is a small family owned business and the most people I have ever seen working here is 4 people.  This isn&#39;t TGI Fridays where there are a ton of people working all the time.  So, if your service was a little slow then it&#39;s probably a GOOD thing because that means a small, local business is doing well.

My girlfriend and I LOVE Toom Toom. Their food and their staff are awesome. We&#39;ve always been nice to them and they&#39;ve always been nice to us in return.  We&#39;ve been to Toom Toom enough that Chef Toom knows exactly how spicy to make our food.  The portions a reasonable and the flavors are excellent.  I&#39;ve tried most of the items on the menu and I prefer the Green and Red curries with chicken.  If you don&#39;t feel like eating in the restaurant, festival park is a short walk away.  Get your food 
to go and enjoy eating outside!

Also, if I understand correctly, Toom Toom is BYOB."

We stopped into Toom sunday evening based on a few freinds recommendations and pretty good reviews on Yelp. We walked into Toom and I thought we walked into a bar a empty bar but a lovely young lady came from in back and asked if we wanted to be seated. We said two please and she took us into the dining area and sat us down. We were the only ones there and we were concerned did we make a bad decision coming here.

We ordered a appetizer of Crab Rangoon and a couple of drinks before ordering our dinner. The Crab Rangoon were crispy and tasty not the best I ever had but probaby top five. Then I ordered the Garlic shrimp dish and my wife had the sweet and sour shrimp.

We were both extremely impressed by the dinners and wondered why they weren&#39;t busier so I asked our waitress are they always this slow and she said on subdays if there isnt a concert or event going on they are usually slow. but during the week and saturdays are much busier.

We found out as we were paying our bill that the name of the restaurant Toom is actually our waitresses mom&#39;s name whom was the Chef here. They are very friendly and if your in Elgin near the boats I highly recommend Toom Toom Thai give them a try!!"

Nothing fancy or up scale but they keep it relatively well kept. Overall the food was good. You can&#39;t beat a $7 lunch special. I walked away happy and full. The only point I can say detracted from my experience were that the tables weren&#39;t bussed or cleaned even after I was the only in the room. Even for a take-out place that is something simple that can be done. Other than that this place is definitely worth the visit or for take out.

To begin, I love the decor and ambiance. The walls are a bright red, and are decorated with really lovely photographs of scenes of Thai life: women at the fish market, a tuk-tuk, the flowing robes of Buddhist monks.  I had the green curry noodle soup, and I must say it was fabulous.  The green curry had a really fresh flavor, and finished with a great spiciness.  My husband loved his basil chicken, which was authentically ground rather than sliced, and my parents really enjoyed their pad thai.  On the whole, I would definitely take their spicy warnings seriously.  Both the green curry and the basil chicken were quite spicy (a definite plus in my opinion).

What put this place up from four stars to five was how accommodating they were.  My mom has a shellfish allergy, which can be really challenging at Thai restaurants.  However, the chef offered to make her anything on the menu without shellfish or fish sauce, and used separate utensils and cookware just to be safe.  When my dad and I ordered tofu dishes, the waitress asked if we were vegetarian and needed the dishes made without fish sauce and in special cookware.  How nice is that?  I&#39;ve never before had someone be so proactive about making sure the food fit our dietary needs.  It was really wonderful.

Toom Toom is better than most of the Thai I&#39;ve had in Chicago, and I only wish I could find a place this good in the city.  Luckily, my parents live near Toom Toom, so I&#39;ll be able to go frequently. 

Right now, they&#39;re waiting for the liquor license, so it&#39;s BYOB, and I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s any corkage fee.  Next time I go, I&#39;ll definitely take advantage of that.

Also, to respond to some other posts, I agree that the service is slow.  However, there is one waitress, the daughter of the chef, and I do get the sense that she goes back and helps with the cooking.  Maybe not ideal, but for a new restaurant with not a lot of capital, I&#39;m willing to let it go.  Also, I don&#39;t really mind dishes coming out one at a time if there&#39;s only one chef.  I appreciate that each dish is actually made from scratch when ordered.

Also, why is everyone ordering crab rangoon?  Cream cheese isn&#39;t Thai food, people."

On my first visit I had the Pad Kee Mao and it was awesome. I love spicy food and yes it WAS spicy but they do ask what level of spice you prefer.  My four year old daughter devoured her pot stickers and cucumber salad.

 We ordered the Basil Chicken and Thai Chicken Fried Rice to take home and the rest of the family loved it.  All of the vegetables are extremely fresh and the dishes are not the least bit oily.

Today I ordered Hot and Sour Broth with wide noodles and chicken.  The chicken was extremely tender and the broth was very tasty.  There were fresh vegetables such as cheery tomatoes and bean spouts through out.  The perfect lunch for a cold September day."

First off, the people there are wonderful! We felt like we were eating at someone&#39;s home, not a restaurant. My 4 year old daughter loved the people almost as much as they loved her, it is VERY child friendly which is a big plus in our book. Our waitress who I believe is the daughter of the chef was very informative and even took the time to explain her mothers specialty dessert, the purple rice, which by the way is amazing! You can taste the hours of love put into preparing it. And after our meal, her mom came out to see how we were and insure we had a nice meal, and even asked my daughter to insure she liked it as well. And we assured her that everything was wonderful, and it was.
 The food was terrific, all piping hot except for my daughters food,  which was brought out at perfect temperature for her to eat. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered. All plates were clean which is rare for us with Thai or Chinese restaurants. And do yourself a favor and do NOT pass up a chance at having the purple rice dessert. You have the choice of having it served with coconut ice cream (which we had and was amazing), banana pudding, or fresh sliced mangos which my daughter had which she loved. Once again all plates were cleaned off as we dare not leave a single bite. 
 Some may like the food at other places a bit better, but you can&#39;t beat the atmosphere and hospitality of this place. That along with very good food has officially made this our go to Thai restaurant."

Great food, nice atmosphere and the people working their which normally is one cook, two waiting the tables and maybe another person (all family) are just doing what they LOVE to do!  Toom, is just one great person that knows how to cook REAL Thai food.  I only have paid a visit their 5 times and once for a Christmas take out business party.  And yet I feel like I am part of their family!  Chong, you ROCK!!!!  

Some may say the portions are not as large as other Asian establishments and you are right.  Some may say the time from ordering to actually getting the food is not always the quickest but people remember that good things take time!

Sit back, get an appetizer or two, BYOB (I think you can) go with the thought that for the next hour and a half you are going to have great conversation with whom ever you are with and some of the best Thai food you can experience away from Thailand.

And as Chong would testify, the desserts are probably the best thing and you just cannot pass them up.  Now these are not some fancy thing you may find at a French Bistro.  Sometimes when they bring it to the table you might not be 100% sure the difference from one to the other.  But when you take that first bite, your mind forgets about any other problems or stresses you may have and everything is now concentrating on the full taste of the dessert!

A &#34;must go to&#34; place to go out of your way that places like Dundee or St Charles just don&#39;t have nor a chain can never come close to delivering such a terrific evening for your taste buds!"

Food is your typical American fare; burgers, sandwiches, steaks, etc. All of it looked pretty good. Lots of variety to choose from as well. I ordered a burger, which was cooked exactly how I wanted. We also ordered beer cheese soup, some nachos, truffle fries, potato skins, and a rueben for our group of 4. 

I thought the best deal was the beer paddle (sampler) for $3.50 when you buy an appetizer. Beers are solid and it gives you a variety to taste to see what ones you like best. 

Not sure why this place is rated average. I&#39;d definitely come back for the food and the beer. Lots of outdoor seating too when the weather is nice."

Went a second time. My friend ordered the bacon Bleu burger with fries. I ordered the (app) seafood trilogy which was a perfect portion. I also ordered the wedge salad without the steak. This salad was a good portion too and very good. The seafood trilogy was ok, it&#39;s tuna, grilled salmon and sea scallop. The sea scallop was my favorite and normally wouldn&#39;t be. We also split one pretzel with mustard (app) and the baked potatos (app) those were both okay, have had better. 

I&#39;d say try this place but you&#39;re not missing out either. It is a brewery after all so if you like beer, check it out!!"

Emmett&#39;s was the perfect place.  We knew we could get a great meal in an atmosphere that was warm and cozy without being old and stuffy.  And we had a server, Sarah, that couldn&#39;t have been more pleasant.  As always when we leave Emmett&#39;s we were not disappointed.

One thing I&#39;d warn you about though.  When we went there last time for some late night desserts, the portions were just right.  This time when we ordered desserts, the portions were on steroids.  So we had to bring some home.  Oh well, I guess there could be worse things to deal with. :-)"

The appetizers were all really good, including the charcuterie/cheese plate, calamari, and the spinach artichoke dip. The latter had great flavor and not too much mayo, as well as perfectly crisped pita triangles. The calamari wasn&#39;t greasy and had a good mix of the squid circles and mini octopuses. Sauce was just so so. The charcuterie had some good dips and was presented really well. 

The place was huge and good for big parties. The beer selection was obviously plentiful with it being a Brew-pub and everyone liked their selections on tap. 

Entree wise it was one of those menus where you have a lot of trouble picking something with all the great selections. Small plates, entrees, brew-pub fare, it had it all. But had the pub theme so it wasn&#39;t like they were trying to do too much. I really liked the French onion soup that came with my tuna. All the entrees looked decent as well that came out."

The food is hit or miss here; the last time I had the fish tacos which were good but my Mom did not enjoy her buffalo sliders and she&#39;s not that picky and loves buffalo sauce.  My son had the fish and chips which were kind of expensive for about 2 filets. The craft beers are good and it&#39;s fun to watch games here too.

Long story short, we were blown away by how marvelous this place is. Great mood, service, and food. The atmosphere reflects an elegant American Pub with dark wood being the prevalent mood setter. Jordan, our waitress, was exceptional as well. She walked us through her favorites in each category of the menu, and also offered us free samples of their local brews.

We tried the roasted mozzarella flatbread as an appetizer, and it was one of the best appetizers we&#39;ve ever had. I got the pulled pork Sandwich with chili- which was great as well. The wait for our food took a little longer than most places, but we were in no rush, so it didn&#39;t make a difference for us. 

After the meal, I sampled a few of their drinks, and they were exceptionally smooth with great flavor. All around a winner and we will definitely be coming to this place regularly in the future!"

I can&#39;t comment on the food in detail but I remember it being good.

My recent visit was a day out with friends, the place was moderately busy, and I felt our service was prompt enough, but our server was super nice and apologetic.  We were all happy at the table!

We wanted beer flights that&#39;s all, so we ordered them not even knowing the price.  We all liked most of the beers and some we really loved! When we got our check we were happy to find out the flights were reasonably priced as well.

This has certainly made a place in my memory as a solid stop in Palatine for beer and good eats in a cozy atmosphere."

The menu is diverse and on point. I&#39;ve tried almost everything from the starters to the burgers. The Jamaican &#34;me&#34; jerk wings are tasty and my favorite (I&#39;m a cereal repeat offender).  All their soups are delicious, but I recommend the chili. If you are in the mood for a good burger, go for it. The only thing I&#39;ve had that I don&#39;t recommend is the catfish bites (too bland for my liking-but maybe you are the bland type and this could be a match made in heaven; who am I to say?) 

The beer of the month club is a great deal: you get a free app up to $15, a free meal on your birthday, and upgrades on all their beers. Definitely worth it and a great gift for the local beer aficionado. Plus 10% off on Sundays and Mondays, and did I mention... three locations. I know what your thinking, damn this guy has me sold, but wait. One time I ordered a plate of wings and they brought me or two. No reason why, maybe they thought I was malnuturished, but either way I didn&#39;t pay for em. True story and just think, if you work hard and get lucky in life, maybe you can get a free plate of wings too. The sky&#39;s the limit and God bless America!!"

They have a good variety of food to choose from, and so far I would recommend their burgers, the brewers chicken sandwhich, and the nachos (the half order is enough to feed 2 people).  The food is a little pricey for the portions that you get, but it tastes good and leaves me pretty satisfied when I&#39;m done.

I mainly stop in here for the beer though.  They have beers that they brew all year &#39;round, but also others that are seasonal.  I always love trying the different seasonal beers, and I am rarely disappointed.  Most of the servers are knowledgeable about the different brews and should be able to recommend one based on your personal preference.  If you don&#39;t like beer, but still want a drink, then there are still a whole bunch of cocktails and wine to choose from.

The only thing keeping this place from being a 5/5 is the price of the food, but I still highly recommend it to anyone in the area!"

My husband&#39;s milk stout beer was sour with 1/3 of the glass taken up by head. The truffle fries were nothing special and his hamburger was overcooked (not sure how you can even try to customize the temp on such a thin patty.) all together we paid $35 plus tip for a late lunch beyond mediocre."

We parked right near Tap House and were about to go in, but then we saw Emmett&#39;s! We&#39;re always down to try a new brew and it looked like a nice place to we stopped in.

I have to say, I wish I would have read the reviews first, but I am happy I experienced it first hand. We were there around 12 pm on a Friday, so maybe that&#39;s one reason we didn&#39;t have as bad of an experience as other people. There were other groups in the bar, but overall it wasn&#39;t busy at all. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about the different beers.

We decided to split the flight of beers, because it was such a good deal. For only $6.25 we were able to sample 6 different beers. A few we really really like, a couple not so much. It was the perfect amount of beer to accompany our lunch though and it was great to taste so many.

I ordered the Slider Trio off the small plate portion of the menu and I thought they were very good! The sliders included a Pale Ale Pork, Mini Brie Burger and a Tenderloin Slider with my choice of a small side. I went with the sweet potato fries. The burgers themselves were really delicious. I loved the variety and whatever kind of buns they used were super tasty. My fries on the other hand, not so good. They were basically served cold which was obviously unpleasant and unacceptable in my book (especially because they weren&#39;t very busy). My husband basically had the same experience. He ordered a burger and sweet potato fries - demolished the burger joyfully and sadly left his old fries alone. 

I personally think after spending about $35 on a lunch, we should have left way more satisfied. This isn&#39;t the worst place I&#39;ve ever been, but definitely not the best. I feel like they have prime time real estate and excellent beer, but maybe need to either price adjust or boost their quality of food and service."

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and it is comfortable inside. I was there for lunch on a weekend and it was not too crowded which was nice, but it began to fill up into the afternoon.

For the food, I had the cheddar ale soup which was very good and perfect for the winter season. It came with a soft pretzel. I also had the taco and truffle fries from the small bites menu both of which were good. I liked the portion size. Usually when I go to places, I always end up with leftovers but here, the menu lets you order smaller sizes so you can pick and choose a few things and it is not too much.

Overall I would go back again and get the soup and try some more items from the menu."

Our server, Earnest, was wonderful.  He offered a sample of their ale, but it was warm... which is a bar issue, not a server issue.

The length of time it too to seat our party: 8 minutes.  The two hostesses couldn&#39;t figure out where to put us... and there were three other occupied tables in the entire restaurant.

The food, meh. Mini burger cooked to hockey-puck perfection.

The drinks, meh.  They always take too long to arrive from the bar.

The atmosphere, meh... there were three other tables in the entire restaurant.

The beer cheese soup, meh... tasted like melted velvetta with no hint of beer.

Our waitress was quick to take our orders and we hadn&#39;t gotten a chance to open the menu yet.  She seemed annoyed that we weren&#39;t ready and left our table with a &#34;could care less&#34; attitude.

A few minutes after our waitress left our table another couple were seated across from us. Five minutes later they had their drinks delivered and getting their order taken.  Meanwhile we&#39;re still looking for our waitress to bring us our water.  The other waitress assigned to the other table obviously was aware we were still waiting to be served purposely avoided eye contact with us.

After a few more minutes of lack of attention we just decided to leave as we didn&#39;t feel welcomed.  The hostess asked us how it was and I just responded, &#34;not good&#34;, not wanting to answer her query of &#34;why&#34;?  I was too pissed off and didn&#39;t want to cause a scene especially in front of my children.

The hostess is super duper friendly and I think this place would be better served with someone like her waiting on tables. Our actual server was so insanely slow and completely disinterested. She was unfriendly and just not happy at all, it really affected our whole dining experience. There would be huge blocks of time where she would disappear. We were done eating for about 20 minutes before she came to our table again &amp; we asked for our check. Then another 20-30 minutes for the process of actually getting our check and paying. It just dragged on and on and on...

The real kicker for me though was when two guys grabbed a table behind us and she greeted them in a super duper friendly way. Wtf? Sexism up in here! The chick don&#39;t like chicks. Even if that&#39;s not the case, that&#39;s absolutely the impression we were left with here. 

Prices here are quite high. My friend and I opted not to have any of their entrees here which range $14-$23, though they do have burgers for $10-14. We both got a couple of small plates (ranging from $3-11) most of which interestingly/strangely come with a side. So...you could get the $4 mini slider potentially and get it with a side of their fries. Weird concept but hey I&#39;m down with more food. I got the Pork Belly Taco for $5 and the Slider Trio for $11 consisting of a Pale Ale Pork, Mini Brie Burger and Tenderloin Slider. The pork belly taco was forgettable, I&#39;m a huge pork belly fan and just didn&#39;t find the flavor there. The slider trio was a much better choice and I&#39;d recommend it to others. I wouldn&#39;t say it was amazing but all three sliders were decent and it was a good value.

My big thing this year is trying all the local breweries and Emmett&#39;s is just a couple of miles from my house! I was optimistically excited about finding a brewery so close to home that could become a regular hot spot for me. They have a fabulous outdoor patio that I&#39;m sure is amazing to catch a beer on in the summer. Problem is, I didn&#39;t really care for any of their beers. Just as with food, liking beer is completely subjective but none garnered more than 2.5 bottle caps from me on Untappd. Their star of the show is definitely the Pale Ale so give that one a try. 

Actually, give them all a try and judge for yourself! You can try all 5 of their beers for just $6.25! Quite a fantastic deal and you get to see what you like best before ordering a pint. They call it &#39;The Paddle&#39; and it legit comes out on a paddle. I really liked that they came out with a full description of each beer and the description correctly corresponded to the beer on the paddle. Made it super easy for me to keep track of them while going through each one. Especially since our server really didn&#39;t offer anything in this area, no descriptions, never asked if I liked them, just so insanely unfriendly. 

Honestly I think my whole experience was dampened by such poor service. I really would like to go back, sit on the patio, try some different foods and definitely get a different server."

My coworker and I hit up this place after work on a Thursday to do a little celebrating for the birthday of yours truly.  We were able to get seated right away and our server was funny.  He served us the wrong drinks and then he was telling us how he hadn&#39;t made any mistakes till we showed up.  It was entertaining.

We both ordered drinks and also ordered an appetizer.  The drinks were really good.  I ordered the mac&#39;n&#39;cheese for my entree and it was indulgent.  I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again.  It was good but I should have gone with a burger because those looked amazing.  

I&#39;m not a huge fan of the brews at Emmet&#39;s but the Red ale one is pretty good.  They have a few other cocktails and I tried one of those. 

The atmosphere in the bar area is fun.  Noisy but we could still hold down a conversation without yelling."

Was a little disappointed at the service at the bar. It seems like all of the patrons are best friends with the bartenders. We broke the golden rule of waving a bartender down because we couldn&#39;t get anyone to serve us a drink or provide us with a drink menu. We were able to settled for a booth in the bar area after waiting 25 minutes. The service by the waitstaff was a little more attentive, but I have to admit that our moods were soured at that point.

With that said....

Truffle Fries Roasted Garlic Aioli, a must have. Fries are beautifully cooked and lightly seasoned with super minced garlic salt and olive oil. It was crispy, it was soft and hot on the inside. A must have as an appetizer. 

Artichoke &amp; Spinach Dip Crispy Pitas, can pass on it the next time we go. Wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. Edible.

Slider Trio Pale Ale Pork, Mini Brie Burger, Tenderloin Slider, also a must have. Melt in your mouth pale ale pork and tenderloin sliders. Seasoned wonderfully. The Brie burger was just brie cheese on a small hamburger patty. A little lackluster in my personal opinion.

Overall, would probably not visit this establishment again in the near future. I just don&#39;t like feeling I&#39;m invisible when I need a drink. The finger foods are worthwhile, but not the service."

Worked amazingly  for a welcoming party after my brother&#39;s 2 year absence in the country.
It is a little too long drive for me, but yes, I will gladly stop in when in the area."

Great ambiance, especially the patio when the weather is nice. Great menu has a little bit for everyone, nice beer selection, nice patrons that aren&#39;t too loud or obnoxious, and caring attentive staff.

I love the black bean burger and the truffle fries, but the portabello fries are a new favorite too! They also make a mean Arnold Palmer mmm

We&#39;ll be customers for years to come, thanks for the great job guys and gals!"

Too bad they can&#39;t match the food and beverages with the staff...then they would really have something special there.  We parked in a public parking lot a stones throw away from the restaurant.  I think you should stick to the burgers or the pulled pork type sandwiches.  Otherwise the portions were really terribly lacking.  I ordered the tacos...I had a choice of white fish, tuna or steak, I opted for the steak and tuna...literally a tablespoon of meat in a 4 inch diameter tortilla-2, for the price of an entree what a joke.  This wasn&#39;t even an appetizer portion.  One of my sons had a crabcake burger...he&#39;s pretty easy when it comes to dining out...very disappointing, puny piece of whatever served in a bun.  Husband ordered a pulled pork sandwich, everything good there....my 21 year old had a reuben...pretty puny...you can get a great reuben elsewhere ten times as good for less.  I ordered a dirty martini....it was really dirty...literally all olive brine and NOT a martini...NO vodka whatsoever.....I think I drank a jar full of vinegar....didn&#39;t want to complain since we were out for my sons 21st...they are making a bundle profit on mixed drinks there....lots of other places to check out...this place is ok for a beer after work, but don&#39;t expect good food for what they charge and their mixed drinks are a joke."

The inside is a very comfortable English/Irish Pub setting that&#39;s very clean and inviting. The patio outside is perfect for the summer and great for people watching. 

I usually just stick to the burgers and sandwiches and all of them are good and never had a bad meal. Love the Brewhouse and Blue Cheese w/pear burgers and also check out the Spicy pork sandwich. For the apps the pretzel twists with the beer cheese sauce is pretty tasty so are their Nachos and Truffle fries.

Now I&#39;m not Craft beer geek but considering the awesome suds breweries in the city and the surrounding suburbs have been churning out the last several years I have to say none of Emmett&#39;s brews have really ever blown me away. They&#39;re good, but not anything that will leave you speechless. But I do suggest you get a flight of their beers to check them out.

Emmet&#39;s is a fine place to go if you&#39;re in the mood for low key night in the northern &#39;burbs. As some others have said their service is a bit hit and miss but other than that it&#39;s worth checking out."

We held my daughter&#39;s baptism reception there with a group of 22 adults.  Mindy was so accommodating.  As a sleep-deprived new mother, she helped me figure out a great menu that would meet our budget.  The last thing my husband and I wanted to do was clean our house to host something and then clean it again after everyone left, so we were so happy to be able to have the event at Emmett&#39;s.  We chose to have a plated meal with 3 entree options, and based on many of my guests compliments, they really enjoyed the Rigatoni Mozzarella, Grilled Chicken Breast, and Grilled Salmon Fillet. She also provided us with a cake table, gift table, and arranged the few decorations we brought along with us. The server, Brian, was amazing as well.  Not only was he our bartender, but he really took the time to be in communication with me as the meal progressed, asking when I wanted him to take orders, cut the cake, serve ice cream, etc.  I will definitely be recommending Emmett&#39;s to others in the area that want to host events.  This is the 1st event I have hosted here but 3rd event I have attended here, and I have yet to be disappointed. We&#39;ll definitely be back! :)"

I got a beer paddle and small plates of a pulled pork sandwich and the wing sampler. My spouse got the pork chops and thought it was delicious.  At the end, I got the check. I noticed I was over-charged for the beer sampler. The waitress blamed me for not telling her that the beer sampler has a discount with small plates, as indicated on the menu. She did fix it, though. I&#39;m sorry, you have one customer and you&#39;re blaming me for your inattentive behavior? She was nice though, but she should not have said what she did. The food was good.

The cocktails were delicious though!  I think this is a good place to bring your family for a Sunday dinner. Reminds me of a Thanksgiving dining room.

Emmett&#39;s was the first microbrewery I tried back in Chicagoland- I love it! Balanced brews, fun food, it&#39;s a nice place. Plus, its within eyeshot of the Palatine metra station. Score!

I&#39;d just like to comment on the service- I saw someone wrote a 1 star review based on the waiters (amended to a 4 star review- What? What 1 star restaurant can improve that much). I think that the waitress and the bussers did a great job. Shout out to folks with a tough job- thanks!

I went back to Emmett&#39;s with a group of six on Friday and was pleasantly surprised at how great our overall experience was. Our server was awesome (and I don&#39;t say that lightly). I feel awful I can&#39;t remember her name she certainly deserves a shout out, and was on top of her game.

After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant to come here. But a coworker said that their cheese soup was really good, so we came here for lunch. He was correct, the cheese soup was really good. However, that is about the only thing they have going for them.

The atmosphere is alright - they have a dining area and a bar/pub area. We sat in the pub area for lunch. They have some TV&#39;s so you can watch a game or the news. The hostess was nice and we were seated right away...but after that the service sucked. The only thing our waitress did was ask for our order, bring the food, and take the check. She never asked about refills, never asked how the food was, didn&#39;t say thank you, and took FOREVER. We waited a really long time for her to come to the table, to bring our food, and to bring/take our checks. I hardly saw any servers at all...so I don&#39;t know if they are understaffed or what.

The food, besides the soup, was pretty blah. I ordered the slider trio. Most of the meat was dry, one of the sliders was pretty tasteless, and the slaw was just ok. My friend ordered the truffle fries - very garlicy and greasy. I do like the small plates menu, but considering I wasn&#39;t all that impressed with the food...I probably won&#39;t be back to try more.

Really, the service is what killed the whole experience. It&#39;s really too bad."

Our previous bad experience was being ignored and not waited on.  During the summer, we came back with friends, and had a pretty good experience.  So with company, we decided to go there again since our guest is a fan of microbreweries.

Beer - decent.  The Octoberfest got better reviews than the brandywine.  The vodka and cherry coke got a meh.

Dinner - I ordered the tuna, hold the rice and double the vegetables.  Can&#39;t remember when I had to send my meal back TWICE!  First time it came out was full rice, vegetables and tuna - please remove that rice and double the veggies.  Came back with only tuna and rice....  Then I finally got the tuna and just a couple of vegetables - no sauce this time.  Guess they were tired of me.  So the waitress came by and seemed genuinely shocked that they didn&#39;t give me what I had wanted.  Where was she during all this time?  I felt really ripped for the price of the meal.

Two orders of wiener schnitzel - sour, sour, sour....  nothing to balance the sour tastes.  
And no gravy or sauce for the schnitzel.

Battered cod - fine

And it was steaming hot in the restaurant.  Guess it was Homecoming, so they heated up the place for the lovely ladies in evening gowns, but the rest of us were dying.  

So guess we&#39;ll go off to the multitude of other great restaurants in the area."

Starting with the service, they are extememly attentive and quick to take orders.  I LOVED the 1am beer on tap, it was refreshing with a complex flavor.  So far I have tried the veg burger and truffle oil fries, both of which were awesome.  The burger was a double stack of black bean burger which was filling and very tastey.  The fries felt heavy, but the truffle oil is really good
I have also tried a salad, which was also a large portion and taste very good.  I&#39;m not sure what the bad service reviews are about, becuase both times I have been there we had nothing but the best service with an attentive waitress and meals delivered in a timely fasion.

Very rude wait staff. Waitress was not familiar with the menu. The place was almost empty at 2pm on Sunday before Christmas. They told us that most of their tables had reservations and that they would have to stuff 5 of us into a small booth. After two hours all the tables were still empty. Food was mediocre at best and not worth the prices. This place used to be far better. What happened?"

Seasonal brews? Ok.
Food? Always a disappointment. Always.
Service? ..... A joke.

I&#39;ve given Emmett&#39;s the benefit of the doubt..and repeat business. But there are puh-lenty of better places to spend your time, calories, and money. I have grown to have a gag response when someone suggests we go there. No, thank you. 

Food is overpriced, drinks are ok, but nothing spectacular. And the service. Wow. They are beyond slow, and not in the intentional-so-you-spend-more. It is more the wtf variety. Not only are they slow, but there&#39;s a chip in the shoulder of EVERYONE I have ever been in contact with. 

Last time I was there, I was with two friends who got a table while I went to the restroom. On my way past the server hangout in the bar (mind you, this is in the open, and right by the patio door), three of the staff were very obviously making unprofessional and rude comments about the appearance one of my friends. Really? Good thing you&#39;re so much better than the rest of us, staff at Emmett&#39;s. Sorry to bother you with our humanness."

Let me preface this by saying I&#39;m a patient person and have dined here many times as we live down the street. 

Each time we make excuses for how terrible the service is. But tonight it&#39;s reached the tipping point. All the tables around us are flagging down staff to take their order or to inquire about where their order is. Every time we&#39;ve ever been here I have to flag someone down to take our order, fill the water, inquire about where our entree is, and find out if there can bring our bill at the end of the night. And this process takes place on a slow Tuesday or a busy Saturday.

I feel bad for the wait staff as it clearly isn&#39;t their fault. We&#39;ve gone off and on here for several years always hoping at some point management would figure it out. Sadly, that just isn&#39;t happening.

Why have we continued to go back over the years? It&#39;s not the food (very average), obviously not the service...it&#39;s the location (2 blocks from the house). They are the only game in town right now. However, that is soon to change with the opening of Tap House (a stones throw from Emmett&#39;s) at some point this summer. It&#39;s pretty apparent Tap House isn&#39;t afraid of competing with Emmett&#39;s and rightfully so. Once Emmett&#39;s starts loosing customers to Tap House they&#39;ll try to fix their issues but it will be too late. 

I pull for good business in Palatine and wish they would figure it out but my money will be spent else where from now on."

We waited at least 30min to get drink orders while sitting outside, and yet another HOUR for them to bring our food (6 people). I ordered a beer flight and was the only one not carded, which is fine, but I&#39;m 23. 

Beer was mediocre at best...I&#39;d much rather go to Lucky Monk in Barrington for a flight and a burger.

Ordered the stuffed chicken. SUPER overloaded in butter and garlic, and my friend and I both ordered baked potatoes as substitutes for the mashed potatoes. After our hour wait, neither baked potato came, so we asked about it. She then took my plate away only to return 3 minutes later with the exact same plate...saying she&#39;ll bring out the baked potato when it&#39;s done. Ok...then why&#39;d you take my plate? Also, my friend never got his potato, and she never acknowledged that she didn&#39;t bring it. At that point, we didn&#39;t really care and just left it as is. Luckily we weren&#39;t charged for it on the bill.

After all this...the truffle fries were the only thing that was decent. The vegetables in my plate and my friend&#39;s plate were completely uncooked and covered in butter. It&#39;s a very expensive mistake...costing us almost $160 between the six of us for mediocre food and beer and TERRIBLE service. Come on...keep the water filled and come by more than once every 20 minutes. Three hours after arriving, we got our check (not split, even though requested earlier). I NEVER stiff waitresses, but she was horrendous, and we actually did end up leaving a barely visible tip.

Don&#39;t waste your time here...go to Lucky Monk (Barrington), Emerson&#39;s Ale House (Arlington Heights), Stonewood Ale House (Schaumburg) or somewhere where they actually take service seriously.

Just so disappointing."

Food was straight up the worst I&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant, which is fine. The service was in the bottom 5%, which is fine. Apparently Yelp dislikes anonymous reviews, so hi everybody.

Chicken was essentially raw,  so badly uncooked I sincerely hope it was pre-cooked. Not fine. The only thing I ask of a restaurant is it not get me sick. I was with a group and couldn&#39;t say anything

Decor was super nice and modern. Didn&#39;t drink alcohol, probably should have done that instead."

Me and a good friend were out on our motorcycles when we saw this nifty looking joint right near the train tracks. It seemed perfect - cool looking joint, house brews, outside patio, the works for my type of dining experience.  

We walked in and were greeted by an exceptionally friendly and warm hostess who seated us right away. Walking through the restaurant and seeing all the different beers people were drinking and the cool looking appetizers was making me giddy; the place was tastefully decorated and lit as well.  Unfortunately, all of the excitement quickly dissipated once we were seated.

It took over 10 minutes to even see what our waitress looked like, and I&#39;m not sure why... I saw two other waiters serving people around us and talking with customers having a grand old time. As she approached the table, her demeanor reeked of sadness and hatred. She approached us with a face that would indicate I had just killed her first born. 

Upon arriving - she coldly muttered the words &#34;Anything to drink.&#34; I left the question mark out on purpose - because she didn&#39;t say this in a questioning manner.  We ordered our beer and waited a lengthy 10 minutes before we got them. The beers were decent, as well as the appetizer we ordered shortly after - we ordered the pretzels with horseradish and cheese (except they didn&#39;t come with cheese as the menu said they would. We finished the pretzels before the waitress came back because she took eons and we&#39;re hungry young men, dammit. Strike 2, Emmett.)

The awkward interactions with the waitress continued through the evening until we got our main course. From this point on, we would not see our waitress again until she brought our check a half hour later.  This proved problematic, since the medium-rare Kobe burgers we requested arrived as charred hockey pucks that could chip a tooth if bitten too fast.  Never have I seen a burger overcooked this much.

At this point I calculated I&#39;ve spent 35 dollars for a pretty terrible experience. My hopes and dreams for this cool looking place were shattered by a miserable waitress and a &#34;Kobe Burger&#34; that tasted as if it&#39;d been on a searing hot grill since the Civil War. I felt robbed.

TL;DR - A cool looking place inside and out, coupled with an expensive menu,  terrible service, and the worst burger I&#39;ve ever had. I made a Yelp account explicitly for the purposes of warning people how bad this burger was."

Sit outside for alfresco dining. If it gets chilly, they have a fire pit that you can sit next to. Inside there is a nice dining area, or sit by the bar to watch a game on the TV.

When we arrived, there were just a handful of patrons and both the bar tender and the hostess told us to sit wherever we wanted so we sat outside on the patio.  An amazing gorgeous October day.

Our drink orders and food order were taken by the bar tender and our drinks and appetizer appeared as normal and were delicious as always.  Then we waited and waited and waited...
and
waited


and
waited

watch the large table next to us be served, ate and them leave

and we
waited

another round of drinks...

and waited

and waited...

apparently our order somehow got lost due to the fact a classic car group showed up in the bar and the bar tender thus had to go back to being a bar tender and not a server and couldn&#39;t believe no-one had taken care of our table.

I have to hand it to the bar tender.  It looked like he was doing the jobs of so many other people there.  I can&#39;t say anything positive for wait staff and hostess staff however.  Completely inappropriate to have a table sit and wait for their food for an hour and a half.

We did eventually get our food but even still we had to go up to the bar and ask the bar tender for our check.  I couldn&#39;t understand why the wait staff was not taking over.

So to make matters worse we had to WAIT 10 more minutes for our check.

Thank you for the complimentary appetizer but I&#39;m probably not going to patronize Emmett&#39;s for a long long time now. I&#39;m a beer club member but even now I think I may pass.  Such a shame."

I had gotten lost on the way and so arrived really late.  I only had time to order an appetizer to go before my friend and I had to be on our way.  I had to track down the server, and asked her how long it would take to make the loaded potato appetizer.  She kind of looked at me funny, nodded towards the dining room and said &#34;well, it&#39;s really busy here tonight, so maybe 20 minutes?&#34;  There were a whole six tables occupied, including our own.  Not sure how that qualifies as &#34;busy&#34;.  But I said okay.  35 minutes later, no appetizer.  I couldn&#39;t even find the waitress to tell her to cancel the order.

I might give it another try some time and hope for better service but so far as a monthly meetup spot, this is looking very shaky.  If they can&#39;t even handle six tables, how are they going to manage our group?"

First of all, too many compliments to the ladies I had a dinner with (my wife and her friend). Compliments about nails, haircut, brows, are you kidding me? In my home country the guy can get a serious punch in the face for familiarity like this. He was lucky that I was in a good mood. Second, he tried to inject his personal favorites when explaining the menu, waiter can recommend something if he&#39;ve been asked, otherwise this is not acceptable. But ok, let&#39;s imagine that maybe he was just overly playing to get a better tips, but at the end when we asked for check, he tried to convinced us to take a dessert, even when he got our polite answer that we are gonna passed on that, he tried again pushing harder explaining that he can&#39;t let such a beatiful ladies without a dessert, not for free of course.

On Friday, August 23rd, a friend and I were hanging out at the Palatine Street Fest and decided that we were hungry and wanted some Emmett&#39;s Nachos...which by the way are really quite good. We got there at 11:40 and I asked the hostess when the kitchen closed. She said midnight and assured us it was fine for us to get a table outside. My friend used the restroom and asked me to order her the lightest beer on the menu with a lemon and the plate of nachos. By the time she got back from the restroom, I was still sitting there with the menus and nothing else.

The waitress approaches our table....an angry looking blonde/strawberry blonde, and proceeds to tell us that the kitchen is closing soon, along with the rest of the restaurant....ummm....yeah, if you would have taken my order ten minutes ago, there wouldn&#39;t have been an issue. We placed our order and never saw the waitress again. The food was served by a young man. She came back to give us our check, and when we put in our cash....she NEVER BOTHERED TO COME BACK WITH THE CHANGE.....nice.

I love how someone so obnoxious could have the audacity to assume the entire amount of the leftover cash is for her. We were planning on leaving her a minimal tip...but no such luck...blondie never bothered to come back.

Well, you know what Emmett&#39;s? I wont&#39; be bothering to come back either.....especially since I filled out a form on your website complaining about the poor service...and have yet to receive a reply.

I had a friend over who doesn&#39;t live around here and when we went to dinner in downtown Arlington Heights, she asked me why weren&#39;t we going to downtown Palatine since that&#39;s near where I live, my response, &#34;Oh, there aren&#39;t any decent restaurants there.&#34; My original plan was to take her to Emmett&#39;s, but not after that experience."

I&#39;ve been here a handfull of times and have always enjoyed the experience, including the time I visitied the Dundee location. 

I haven&#39;t exactly been able to offer my two cents about the establishment to Yelp in the past because I hadn&#39;t really dined at Emmett&#39;s, I mostly just drank beer, munched on their potato skins, and ordered Bear Fight shots. 

During the most recent visit, I ordered a burger with grilled onions and cheddar cheese along with their seasonal hefeweisen brew and pretty much went to town on my food while I gradually sipped the beer.
I have been looking for a good burger and beer place now that my ex-lover (Boston Blackies) closed shop and never called, but I think I have found my rebound. I wish I had taken the initiative to eat dinner here before, I guess I hadn&#39;t thought of it becuase I live in Arlington Heights and usually opt for more local dining, but it&#39;s not too far away so I will definitely have Emmett&#39;s on my radar from now on.

Other items of note include the [battered cod] fish tacos, and the 1 a.m. Ale. And I guess I&#39;ll admit that the Bikini Martini tastes pretty good too..... In hindsight I do love bikinis, and martinis, so why not the combo?

As other reviewers have said, the service definitely needs some work as it can be slow at times -- however the quality of food for the price pushes my rating back up to five stars. If the service was improved, I would definitely come back more often and this could be one of my favorite places to go.

Beer: I tried the sampler paddle and enjoyed all 5 items. In particular the Munich Light German Lager which was clean and crisp with almost no bitterness, the Pale Ale which was bursting with flavor and body and had a pleasant aftertaste, and the Red Ale which had just the amount of sweetness and toastiness to give a nice complex flavor. Although I am not a big fan out stout, I did enjoy the one I had here.

Side Salad: Nice mix of greens with fresh vegetables and croutons. On par with the salads you&#39;ll find at nicer Italian restaurants.

Pork loin sandwich: Bursting with flavor and juicy meat. Flavored with an apricot glaze, bacon, and garlic mayonnaise with a nice sharp cheddar to match with the flavorful onion roll.

Prime rib sandwich: Good size cut of meat (a little thicker than the shavings you&#39;ll find in most restaurants), served with crispy onions and horseradish sauce on a flavorful onion roll. 

Sesame tuna: Slightly overcooked but flavorful and delicious. Actually prepared better than many other specialty seafood restaurants I&#39;ve tried this dish at (go to Bonefish Grill and try the ahi tuna sashimi for something similar).

Sunrise burger: After DC Sarnies had closed in Deerfield, I was afraid i would have trouble finding another awesome burger in the suburbs. However, this burger with a nice thick patty, bacon jam, and fried egg on a brioche bun provided me with the answer to my burger needs. 

At this point, I was about to give 5 for the food but lowered to 4 for service, however the dessert was so good it changed my mind.

Snickers pie: Arguably an improvement on the original candy -- just the right amount of caramel and chocolate with an ice cream that&#39;s not too sweet on a crust of crumbled oreo cookies. Simple, but profound in its flavor.

Raspberry tiramisu: Wow, this was bursting with flavor and aroma -- even without the general heavy liquor flavor you usually expect, it was a great item. The texture was silky smooth, the marscapone cheese provided a full body, the presentation was excellent -- all tied together with just the right amount of raspberry flavor. Definitely a must try item if you love both tiramisu and cheesecake."

I live within walking distance, so I come here regularly for take out and use it as my go-to option when entertaining guests. Everything I&#39;ve had has been stellar. They offer a tasting paddle not on the menu for only $6, but is not on the menu, so you have to ask for it. All of the beers are excellent, especially the stout!

For appetizers, the truffle fries are delicious as are the pretzel twists and the cheddar ale soup. The entrees are also really good, especially the pork medallions and the fried cod. I also love the tavern tacos. Really, there are no bad options! 

Plus, Emmett&#39;s offers small plates so if you want a smaller option or can&#39;t decide between a few choices, that&#39;s a great option as well. If you can save room, don&#39;t miss the desserts! They&#39;re great as well. The one and only downside is that the service can be hit or miss, but never bad enough to spoil a wonderful meal!"

We were seated right away, and our server asked if I wanted to try samples of the beer because I wasn&#39;t sure which one I wanted to order. The food was tasty as well. We just had appetizers, but I hear they have an EXCELLENT portabella mushroom sandwich.  They also have good soups here, and a very nice Brew Club membership.

However, this is a Mom &amp; Pop place that serves fried chicken, ice cream and root beer.

Everything about this place is accentuated by inconsistency, especially the fried chicken. You never know if they have enough pieces available to fill your order. You never know what combination you&#39;ll get for a 4-piece meal, legs thighs or 3 wings and a breast!

We came on a Sunday. There was the big venue that we originally went to and they had said they were closed for the day because of a wedding. There was actually a tasting room that looked like a house that we almost missed but an &#34;open&#34; sign was at the front. We walked in right when it opens at 12 on a Sunday and were greeted for the tastings. 

For 6 dollars a person it is not bad. The pourings were a little small, but the glasses of wine were reasonably priced. We only went to the tasting room but heard there is food served at the actual venue. We were able to sit outside when ordering a glass of wine which is very nice. Very nice for an Illinois winery."

We made reservations for 7 pm and did not get seated until 7:45 and the food did not come until 8:30. The bar area was inadequate for us to enjoy a glass of wine while we waited and waited. That is the big reason for the three stars.  And a reason for thinking twice before we return and defiantly before we think of inviting guests. 

We had the steak and the whitefish.  Both meals were good with ample portions.  The vegetables were on the cold side indicating that they had been cooked some time well before playing. Overall the food was average for the tri cities area but a little on the pricy side. 

Finally the wines which are local.  Pretty good for being from Illinois.  While the winery seeks to be like Napa the wines are a little rough.  The descriptions are accurate but without a comparison. Say this is like a Cabernet make the choosing a wine simpler.  Also we did not find an option to sample a flight of wines which would have been nice.  

Overall and if you remove the reservation and service issue we would be back.  But now have to think twice."

I do not have &#34;refined&#34; taste in food.  I&#39;ve gone to wine bars and their cheese/sausage tray was not a good appetizer here.  I thought their wood fired sausage and mushroom pizza was very good.  The two people with me ordered a whitefish dish that they also liked it.  The wine was ok but @ $7.50 per glass was a a bit much.  The bill came out to about $110 without tip.  
There was a reception party there and that made the tiled area a little loud. It is a beautiful place to visit.  Maybe someday I will come back for a special occasion."

We never made the trip until the Groupon for a wine tasting for 2 came up. The offer included two tastings, two glasses  of wine, and two bottles of wine to take home.  

First thing you notice ... It&#39;s in the middle of nowhere, second is the gorgeous architecture. They really went all out with the appearance.  

We showed up a little early so we just took in the scenery while waiting for any other tour attendees. We were delightfully greeted by the lovely Scottish man Paul.  Let&#39;s just say he is 99.99% of the 4 star rating! If it were just about him this would be a 5 star! If he were not involved it would be a 3! 

Tour was amazing. The wine was all good, very surprising it was from IL!!! ... We actually learned stuff from Paul which is amazing because we are not new to the wine tour ;-). Paul provided an informational yet absolutely wonderful, amusing and down to earth tour!

After the tour we decided to have a late lunch. This is where it gets not so awesome :-( ...

The food was ok. Supposedly traditional Italian food.  I say supposedly because I&#39;m not from Italy, so I have no room to comment.  However, I as well as my Italian-American husband, thought it was just good.  Nothing amazing and nothing terrible.   

Prices were a little high for not knocking my socks off. However I definitely got atleast 3 meals out of the portion size, so if I can eat if before it goes bad it was a bargain ;-) 

Bottom line, worth the trip out, but be prepared for a bill over $60 if you want a drink."

We met friends for dinner and may have found one of the best restaurants in Kane County.  Before eating you almost have to admire the architecture and design of the place though.  Both paid great attention to detail.  

Aquaviva offers an Italian food menu with several great choices.  Before picking something out though, be sure to hear what the specials are.  I had something in mind then the waiter kindly informed us of two other dishes, both of which sounded even better.  I went with the shrimp ravioli with lobster which was phenomenal.  Also had a piece of the salmon, and their tiramisu to finish off the night.  I&#39;m pretty sure everything they make here is top notch as I had trouble leaving even the last bite of tiramisu on the plate, despite being completely full.  It should be noted that Aquaviva is obviously a winery.  I don&#39;t drink wine but our friends do and said their Brianna is top notch.  

Back to the ambiance, they have a musician that plays throughout the evening at a level that&#39;s very enjoyable, and does not dominate the room.  At times he walked around the restaurant and played an accordion.  While there you can view the wine production area from a window on the second floor, or go down to the basement and see it directly.  During daylight hours one of their vineyards can be seen right across the street.  I&#39;d highly recommend dining here if not stopping in for a couple glasses of wine.  We&#39;ll certainly be back.

We checked out the restaurant, enjoyed the wines out back and even went into the store/home. We met the owners and were treated like familiar friends. 

I knew we&#39;d be back for dinner. 

The BIG HIT at this venue is the owner. This guy Vito has clearly built what he wants and living his dream. The dining room is huge, the ambiance is Italian and so is the music from solo accordion player. 

Yesterday I made 7:30 reservations for a special dinner for two. It was FAN-TAS-TIC. Arriving to a full parking lot for a place in the middle of nowhere was a good sign. The dining room was completely full. Table came fast and even though all the servers were busy with huge groups, the service was nearly impeccable. Four stars.. 

Dinner started with a couple of cocktails and an order of the Baked Clams. They were good. Five stars

For entree&#39;s I got the the sauteed Italian sausage &amp; peppers and my girlfriend got veal piccata. Both were above average. Five stars. Dinner wrapped up with a table visit from the owner Vito Brandonisio, a couple of complimentary cocktails and a great dessert. Five more stars.

Vicky was phenomenal at communicating what was happening, while delivering food to guests (which was quite good), and attending to the wedding party, organizing accommodations, directing traffic, and decorating. She even pulled us into the barrel room, allowing us an incredible photo op. The food was good. Excellent bread, pasta. Tasty salad. The chicken piccata could have used more flavor or seasoning &amp; beautiful potatoes less (less ranch?) but otherwise highly recommend this venue for events. I hope to return for a personal trip (rather than business) &amp; do a wine tasting tour. The atrium (with painted ceiling &amp; marble pillars) was beautiful!"

We went yesterday, and had a great time!! When we arrived our tour guide asked us what types of wines we like, and poured us each a glass for the tour. We had a tour of the whole building and were able to watch them bottle the wine...I&#39;d love to go back in the summer to be able to tour the outside, but since it was 2 degrees out we just stayed inside. Our guide was super knowledgeable but not the least bit of a wine snob like you get on some tours. After the tour we did our tasting and selected our bottles to take home...he than poured us more of our favorite wines and let us just relax and walk around the restaurant and look at the patio. 

We stayed for lunch, and the food was average. I wish it had been better. I also wish they had done the seating differently. This is mainly a wedding venue so it was round tables with ugly black chairs. It really took away from the beauty of the place. Food prices were more than reasonable and I would go back for dinner to try something else."

Let&#39;s be blunt: Acquaviva isn&#39;t going to win any international wine competitions with their products. If you enjoy Three Wishes, Yellow Tail or Kim Crawford wines, you may enjoy this winery. If you&#39;re a serious wine drinker, you&#39;ll likely leave the glass half empty, as both my uncle and I did.

The food was largely under-cooked and under-seasoned. I had the gnocchi, which arrived drenched in vodka sauce. The gnocci themselves were so over-cooked that they were chewy and rather unpleasant. But the portions were large, so if you like eating a lot of poorly prepared food, you&#39;re in luck!

The atmosphere is odd as well - I felt like I was in a banquet facility with a large wedding party, not an intimate restaurant. The faux paintings on the wall are tacky, as is the accordion player who serenades every table (no offense to the musician - I&#39;m sure he&#39;s just doing his job). Some people are wearing jeans, others are dressed to the nines in skirts and sequined tops. Bizarre.

Personally, I wouldn&#39;t go back."

First, let me give credit where credit is due.  The place is beautiful.  The owner spent a lot of money making the place look good, and the place has an ambiance conducive to a great dining experience.

Unfortunately, that&#39;s where the quality ends.  

The food is not good.  Now, maybe I&#39;m old fashioned, but when I spend money at a restaurant (quite a bit of money in this case), it had better serve me something better than what I could have done at home with minimal effort.  Unless you have a hard time boiling dried pasta, I&#39;m afraid that you&#39;d probably be able to do just as well at home.  

In particular, we ordered lobster pasta and a margherita pizza.  The pasta dish consisted of frozen Canadian lobster served atop boiled Bertoli pasta.  Zzzzzz.  The pizza was a violation of the Geneva conventions.  It wasn&#39;t so much a pizza as it was a flabby, under-cooked mass of dough with some tasteless mozzarella melted on top, along with wilted basil.  Returned it.

Also, I&#39;m no wine connoisseur, but the wine here is awful (and overpriced).  Gee, who&#39;d have thought.

Just buy a bottle of two-buck Chuck and order from pizza hut."

The deal was for a tour &amp; wine tasting.  We got a quick, yet informative tour - typical of most indoor wine tours and a tasting of 3 white wines and 3 red wines.  

The place on the outside is just beautiful...it seems like it&#39;s out in the middle of nowhere but the grounds and landscaping are just wonderful.  This is also an upper end type of place so the dress is a bit nicer than casual.

After our tour and tasting we had 5pm dinner reservations.  Reservations are a MUST here it seems because the place was fully packed when we left.  Another great tip...sit outside if the weather is nice.  Having dinner with the scenery overlooking the vineyard is very nice as well.

As for the food...VERY good as well as the service.

This place is definitely worth the trip out there!"

We ordered a bottle of pinot noir and it didn&#39;t taste like pinot noir to me. The appetizers were okay, but my husband said the octopus was fishy. 

When I got my entree, the fish was so overcooked it was like mush, with a mushy &#34;crust&#34; on it. No one else was blown away by their food either.

The wait staff was friendly but the service was slow, and it wasn&#39;t even that busy. Not to mention, this place is expensive, so I expect more for what it costs. All in all, I do not have the desire to return."

We arrived around 4 pm and it was not crowded.  I like cutting to the chase so here are my ratings. 

Wine tasting experience - 4 stars -- could only have been better if samples were free.  6 tastes for $6 is fine.  Nice server staff, beautiful tasting bar - but no seats.   

Wine prices by the glass - 5 stars -- really nice wines for 5-7 dollar per glass at the sole location that sells the wine (their house)  not bad.  They have a captured audience right, and still the prices for a glass are reasonable which is appreciated. 

Wine by the bottle prices -  3 stat - nothing under $20 for a bottle.  And while I liked all their wines, 2-3 were pretty exceptional and the highest priced wines were around 29 bucks per bottle. 

Ambiance - 5 stars - exceptionally pretty with a nice outdoor area.   

Service - 5 stars - great friendly staff

Food - 4 stars -  I give 4 stars only because we ate a limited selection - the two of us shared a cobb salad (very good) and a prociutto (sp)  arugula pizza (very good).   A dessert of gelato and cocoa (truffle) was yummy. 

Prices -  3 stars.  For the venue and overall experience, it&#39;s a good value.  I didn&#39;t feel like I was charged too much or too little for the overall experience and service.  

TOTAL TAB FOR 2 WITH A WINE TASTING, 4 GLASSES OF WINE, AN INDIVIDUAL SIZED PIZZA AND SALAD PLUS DESSERT = $72 BEFORE TAX AND TIP.  SO SAY $90...  that &#39;s not highway robbery but it&#39;s not especially inexpensive either.  But again, the cost of the wine by the glass was the real treat. 

Also --- the lack of TV  was AWESOME!!!!"

The place is beautiful. My friend (the bride) had showed me pictures on her phone so I knew what to expect, but my mind was still blown by the beauty of the whole venue. The ceremony itself was hard to see at times because there are these giant pillars in the center. I still had a clear enough view to see all the mushy parts leaving me an utter sobbing mess.

After the quick ceremony was cocktail hour. I was impressed by the friendliness of the bartenders who seemed unphased by the mass amounts of people swarming for a drop of booze. Props for that. 

One of the biggest parts of weddings that I hate is that the food is usually sub-par. It&#39;s hard to make the food consistent when you&#39;re cooking for 150-300 people at once. Acquaviva definitely had some pretty amazing food. During cocktail hour, they passed bruschetta, bacon wrapped dates and meatballs. The crunchiness of the bread with the bruschetta is not braces friendly, so I skipped it -- the bacon wrapped dates were pretty good but can&#39;t compare to the ones at Cafe Babareeba (not that anyone can) so I only had one or two BUT the meatballs were the star of the show. Not joking that I just followed the lady with the meatball tray around for an hour. I think they were getting creeped out by me. YUM.

On to dinner. It was family style and we ended up with a salad, bread, chicken, baked potato, veggies and steak with mushrooms. All of the food was surprisingly hot and very delicious. The star of the show was of course the wine (um..DUH it&#39;s a winery) Since my husband couldn&#39;t make it, my friend was my date. We finished off 2 bottles of Bella Blanco wine between the two of us. I&#39;m not normally a wine-o or anything, but it was THAT good. 

If you&#39;re thinking of planning any sort of event at Acquaviva, as a guest - I would highly recommend it. Everyone that was in attendance raved about the food, the wine and the venue."

Unfortunately, the food was sub-par and therefore my rating is two stars.

The outdoor patio area is gorgeous and it&#39;s enjoyable taking it all in during a mid-day lunch. But the food left so much to be desired. The wine? Average but OK.


Our bruscetta was average (please, use fresh mozzarella like Francesca&#39;s in St. Charles) and lose the red onion. My husband&#39;s panini was average. My homemade ones are far superior to what he was served, both from a taste and style perspective.

But the biggest disappointment was my chopped salad (WARNING...stay away from this). I felt like the greens that comprised the salad were from yesterday&#39;s leftovers, not fresh &amp; green &amp; crisp but wilted and brown. They were drenched in dressing making them even more soggy and unpalatable. The salad had none of the additions that make a chopped salad yummy - bacon, olives, gorgonzola, pasta, etc. I found it difficult to eat the salad given its soggy, stale taste and after a few bites had the wait staff take it away.

Will we go back here? Perhaps one more time to see if they can do a decent pizza only because the ambience is indeed what is worth a visit.."

The only issue I had was that everything seemed to be about twice the cost of another restaurant of this quality.  For example: I had dinner with my daughter and wife.  We all split one appetizer, one salad, one pizza, I had gnocchi, my wife had a glass of wine.  The bill before the tip was $65!

The venue is gorgeous. Try and find somewhere prettier, I dare you. Plenty of room for our 120 guests to mingle. Erin, our Event Coordinator, was a joy to work with. She made our event seamless and stress free. (Thank you Erin!)

They were gracious enough to do two rounds of wine tours for our members and our tour guide, Kippy, was informative, entertaining and funny. (Thank you Kippy!)

And if all of the above wasn&#39;t enough, the food was AMAZING! For a large event, it is often difficult to find a venue with good food. I know, I&#39;ve tried on multiple occasions. The food at Acquaviva was hands down the best reception food we have ever had! Our guests enjoyed steak, pasta, veggies, and an extensive salad bar.

Average ceasar salad that tasted like it was topped with bottled dressing. The octopus sounded promising, but it was chewy, not tender. The pizza was well cooked, but lacking flavour.
 
The red wines were interesting, but nothing that will keep any Napa, French, Italian or Australian vineyard up at night worrying about. The white wines were simply poor tasting, chaptelized, and mostly undrinkable. They were semi-sweet wines made for the local market. 

All of this was served in a a faux Italianate lobby that felt like a cross between a conference center and a wedding reception. Maybe there is a pretty view in the summer - there would have to be to merit a return."

The outside design sticks out a little because of its location but I get what they were going for. It&#39;s a little ways out there but nothing horrible, I thought it was a nice drive from the Wheaton area. 
The wine is good, I&#39;d say its typical Midwest wine. Nothing horrible but mostly on the lighter end with a similar wist throughout. 

Only did a wine tasting on my first visit but their dinner menu looks quite extensive &amp; seems to have some potential!"
acquaviva-winery-maple-park,Steve G.,2EKOXmF_sk1G0bAajWiINg,"Saint Charles, IL",1,1,0,85,8,Uo7WpCV4eH4q0ZEHzF7rMA,2.0,2012-06-03,"Our third visit, and time to post our observations...

First the good...
It&#39;s a beautiful location, overlooking the vineyards and way out in the country. It really feels like you&#39;re in wine country somewhere other than just west of St. Charles. They really cater to wine tastings and small plate appetizers, making it a fun place to go to for an afternoon outing. I liked the meat and cheese plate and it&#39;s priced very reasonably. The wood oven pizzas look great.

Now the not so good, not quite bad...
They only serve their wine, meaning you get what they&#39;ve got. That makes it hit or miss on the wine, and for us, it&#39;s been mostly a miss. Most of the whites are okay, but not really great, and the reds are mostly less than satisfactory. An exception is the 2008 Frontenac (&#34;Illinois Zinfandel&#34;) that does go well with the meats and cheeses, even if it&#39;s missing the pepper we normally expect from a good zin...

The restaurant is also more of a miss than a hit -- at least for a couple. Our last visit, we were seated in the midst of the room that&#39;s full of 8 to 10 top tables. And here we started to think maybe we&#39;re not the demographic for this place. Most of the 10 tops were family-filled, or bachelorette parties, and it seemed the food/wine was secondary to the fun of simply sitting around the same big table. Kind of like &#34;the old days&#34;.

For us, while we enjoy each others&#39; company, it&#39;s still about the food and service. And that&#39;s where it went from not quite good to bad, bordering on ugly.

My wife&#39;s Pollo Picatta, described as &#34;sauteed in a white wine lemon sauce with garlic and capers&#34;, arrived as pale as poached chicken served in a hospital room, missing the garlic, or any hint of lemons. Our guess is that this was cooked off hours earlier and sat waiting for us to arrive. When we arrived, the kitchen was too busy to adequately saute the chicken, choosing instead to simply spoon a little capers in butter sauce on top. It could have been fixed had the waitress had time to even see our furtive waves at her to get it fixed.

My filet, ordered medium-rare arrived dangerously close to medium, although still tender and very tasty.

We ordered a bottle of Frontenac and it was very good with the meat and cheese starter. But they gave us tiny little cheapo tasting glasses, depriving us of the opportunity to swirl our wine, and get our noses into the glasses to fully enjoy the experience. In fact, we saw almost no appropriate glassware at any table. Too bad, they&#39;re missing a chance to make their wine shine.

And lastly, service. As I wrote earlier, we may not be the right demographic. We&#39;re not a table of 6 or more, with multiple generations of family, sitting around a table enjoying food just like we used to get in the old neighborhood. But when your waitress picks up two or three 8 or 10 top tables, It&#39;s easy for her to get overwhelmed. And when your server is overwhelmed, someone&#39;s going to suffer. This time it was us. No one asked us if our food was good, it wasn&#39;t until late in the meal after the bottle was long empty that we were asked if we wanted another, and no one asked if wanted coffee or dessert.

When we complained that the chicken showed no evidence of sauteing, the server (not ours, another server who came by), argued that the chicken was never cooked ahead of time, so she didn&#39;t understand our complaints. She took the chicken to the kitchen and came back with an offer to re-cook the chicken. Sorry, no, not when the other person at the table has finished his entire dinner, and the wine glasses are empty. She took the chicken off the bill.

Still no offer of coffee, no mention of dessert.

Our waitress brought the adjusted bill - no apology offered for the lack of attention to us, or the unsatisfactory meal.

So, to sum it up, we probably won&#39;t be back -- at lest not for dinner. We may try the pizzas, but until they figure out how to turn their entire staff into customer service people, like Francesca&#39;s or Bien Trucha does, it&#39;s too easy to fall through the cracks here.

...and we won&#39;t order the chicken again..."

The medium bad part. Our server was very attentive at first but then just disappeared. I had to ask the bus boy to find our server twice. And after waiting an excessively long time for our check, empty drinks and leftovers packed, I had to ask the bus boy to get it. 

Here&#39;s the bad part. I ordered the zuppa di mare which I&#39;ve heard people rave about. It was mediocre at best.  The serving is huge but it was lacking any spice at all. It was just crushed tomatoes and linguine. There were tons of muscles and calamari but without any spicy juices they just tasted like river water. There were only two shrimp in this dish and there was a tiny piece of fish about the size of a cell phone. This is not the dish that I was told by others to expect. 

For my money Atwaters and Za Za&#39;s have far superior zuppa di mare. Don&#39;t waste your money on this one."

The directions on the groupon were 3 miles from the actually winery which was confusing. As we arrived the hostess seemed confused as to what time the tour was. As we walked to the bar the bartenders were definitely understaffed. As more people arrived for the tour they seemed very overwhelmed with getting glasses and wine. We then were led downstairs to start the tour. However, the tour was more of just pouring wine and not really explaining the wine process or anything about the winery. We definitely received a good amount of wine, but felt very rushed during the tour to finish the amount poured and receive the next. We didn&#39;t even end up receiving the last two wines since the tour guide rushed us back upstairs. A suggestion to the winery is to have a bucket to pour out the wine. After the tour we were brought upstairs to claim our two free bottles that came with the groupon. We ordered our 2 bottles and then the bartender charged us for the bottles. We let her know we had the groupon and received the bottles for free then. I have been to many winery tours and this had to be the worst one. It was more of a wine tasting rather than a tour. We ended up having dinner after and the waiter was phenomenal. I learned more from the specials than the wines on the tour. I had the wood fire pizza which was delicious.

Friends had stopped here in the fall and recommended Acquaviva, and we were definitely not disappointed. We intended to do the winery tour, but we had not called ahead and they were only doing the Groupon tours that day.The hostess offered to see if we could be squeezed in on the tour, but we told her we&#39;d be OK just with doing the wine tasting. The main bar was fairly crowded, and she recommended a wine tasting in the market area in the adjacent building (soon to be a B&amp;B), which she said would be more intimate. We were glad we did that. There was just one other couple there sampling, and the owner&#39;s wife, Dena, was very sweet and informative, and we were chatting like we&#39;d known each other forever. The tasting consisted of 3 whites and 3 reds, all from Illinois grapes. I&#39;m no wine expert, but they tasted pretty good. (The other couple seemed to know much more about wines than I do, and they were impressed.) After buying a bottle of the Piacere, we headed to the main building for dinner. It was beautiful--marble throughout, and a lovely atrium when you enter. The dining area was large and open, well suited for private parties and weddings. The day was ideal for sitting on the patio, which overlooked the vineyards across the street. We ordered the bruschetta for an appetizer, which we both enjoyed. The wife had the panko-crusted whitefish, and I had the scallops wrapped in pancetta. We were very pleased with the taste and the portion size (wife had enough for a meal the next day). Our waitress recommended wines that paired nicely with our meals. After-dinner limoncellos and a shared tiramisu finished off the meal.

Believe it or not,  the western suburbs has a vineyard/winery to boast of.

Acquaviva Winery is a beautiful stone building that sits across of its vineyard on Route 38.  The venue has banquet hall look with a more intimiate feel.  Paintings of Venetian bridges and gondolas pair well with the Italian fare menu.  Gianni on the keyboard plays and sings a mean Michael Bublé.

Service was very hurried and chaotic, but our waitress, Erin, did her best to keep on top of things.  She was very friendly and apologetic when the wrong appetizer showed up on our table.  She even let us keep the extra appetizer that was accidentally delivered.  Also, when my husband had a mild allergic reaction to my fish entree, Erin asked around for Benadryl-pharmacist and server all in one!

The menu promised authentic and simple Italian cuisine.  I couldn&#39;t wait! I had missed great Italian food since coming back from a recent trip from Italia.  Unfortunately, the food fell short of my expectations.  

Appetizers:
-Polpo e Calamari alla Griglia ($13.95)...  I was hoping for more of a clean octopus flavor ever so slightly accented by a good char and lemon drizzle.  Instead this octopus and squid combo was doused in a heavy balsamic vinegar reduction.
-Carciofini al Forno ($9.50)...These artichokes were covered in melted mozzarella and had a slight kick-paprika?  Too much cheese.  Quite heavy for an appetizer.
-Calamari Fritti Dorati ($10.95)...Nothing special.  Fried calamari.  More tentacles than usual, definitely a plus.

Entrees:
-Muletto al Forno ($16.95)...A whole white fish fillet with a crispy bread crumb topping served with two mounds of sauteed spinach and a handful of potato wedges.  Good but not outstanding.    
-Chilean Sea Bass ($29.95) served on a bed of seafood risotto...My husband did not enjoy the grainy, undercooked risotto. 

My husband and I enjoyed a bottle of their Bianco Bello ($20.95) white sweet wine.   They only offered three choices of white wine, two of which were sold out.  Bianco Bello drank like a dessert wine, just as sweet as moscato.

Overall, Acquqviva offers large portions of mediocre food that tries to pass for Italian eats.  The space is definitely beautiful and the wine decent.  Maybe I&#39;ll come by for their wine tastings (6-1 oz pours for $6)."

If this winery/restaurant were located in California, my rating would likely be three stars; however it&#39;s not.  In fact, what owner Vito Brandonisio has built out in the middle of the Illinois heartland can only be described as amazing.  It appears that Vito has spared no expense in building his dream; from the facility itself, to the materials and craftsmanship of the décor.

Overall, the food was prepared extremely well; everyone in our party enjoyed what they ordered.  We started the evening off with the classic Bruschetta alla Romana; for being fall and in the Midwest, I was surprised that the tomatoes were actually ripe and had flavor.  I ordered the Gnocchi al Pomodoro Basilico Sauce with Pecorino; the gnocchi was prepared correctly, great texture and was served with just the right amount of sauce - in other words, it wasn&#39;t swimming...

I specifically ordered the Frontenac, which we were told by our server was an estate wine, grown across Rt 38 at the winery&#39;s own vineyard.  The back label reflected that the wine was bottled in Wisconsin, so it&#39;s possible that winery needed to crush and produce their wines elsewhere until this facility was opened.  I&#39;m not sure I can buy their description of this wine being an &#34;Illinois Zinfandel.&#34;  The flavor profile reminded me more of a Tempranillo, with flavors of blueberry vs. the classic Zinfandel red raspberry.  Overall, the wine was appropriately dry and quality was clean and good.

Service was polite and very friendly; however not pretentious or very sophisticated.  When we first arrived, we visited with the tasting room host, who raved about the food.  We were made to feel comfortable and were not disappointed.  I would summarize to say that for being located in corn country outside of Chicago, this is probably one of the most formal restaurants w/in an hour radius.  I would also recommend coming here for lunch and hope to do so on my next visit."

Joe, Shelly, and the entire staff is a class act and couldn&#39;t be easier to work with. Attentive to every need imaginable. Just speaking with management of Aquaviva you can feel and understand their passion and drive for their company and their customers needs.

Honestly, I would go back at least once a month for the Whitefish and a glass of  ice cold Illinois white wine on a hot summer day.

The wine is great and the vines are across the street. When you first walk in the giant open entry way is so beautiful you must stop in to see exactly what I mean. This is a wonderful place for date night, so romantic and fancy. Wine and dine! 

The wine tasting is fun as well, it is done at the wine bar minus the seats....you have to stand while tasting, and for me I would enjoy it more if I could relax and sit down. 

Certainly giving the winery five stars because it is simply a pleasure to visit. The service is always so excellent."

Happened to go on a day when the place was uncomfortably filled with large groups - which made for quite a bit of noise and chaos.  We passed the wait at the bar - and, honestly, can&#39;t say I was impressed with any of the wines.  The whites were watery, the reds were weak.  After a 60 minute wait, we were seated for dinner (this was well before the dinner hour on a Saturday).  Service was clearly busy - but slow, awkwardly slow.  The dinner though delicious was a piece of fish, some vegetables and literally 3 (small - think &#34;baby&#34;) potatoes.  I don&#39;t need a huge plate to be impressed but I would have enjoyed a few more potatoes.  3 stars for the taste &amp; the beautiful venue but overall I felt the service didn&#39;t match the experience they are trying to create there."

The building is beautiful, and we were warmly welcomed by the host. We had reservations, but arrived early to do a tasting. For $6, we were able to try three whites and three reds. The server asked us about our preferences, recommended wines to try, and was very informative about each of the wines that we tried. She also served us generous tastings! I enjoyed the Donna Mia and Fiore as they were both crisp, dry, and refreshing. I also tried the Vitino, Frontenac, and Don Giuseppe, and recommend all three for red wine lovers. 
After tasting, we had lunch. We each ordered our favorite glass of wine and bruschetta to start. The restaurant was not busy, our server was friendly and efficient, and our drinks and appetizers arrived quickly. My parents had the whitefish, which was cooked perfectly. My sister and I tried the pizza, which had a crispy thin crust and not too much cheese, just the way we like it! For the 4 of us, the bill was $110.
We walked over to the market, which is on the lower level of the soon-to-be bed and breakfast. They sell wine-themed gifts, olive oils, and wine, of course. I bought a bottle of Donna Mia and a bottle of Don Giuseppe. The total was $42, more expensive than my local wine shop, but I was expecting that.
I do wish that the tasting bar was larger. It was pretty crowded when we were there, and we had to wait about 5 minutes for a spot to open up. Other than that, our day at Acquaviva was wonderful, and I am looking forward to returning!"

The building and decor were the biggest treat.  Gorgeous foyer with mosaic floor and painted ceiling.

We had a late seating of 4 so we didn&#39;t have to deal with the busy waitstaff as some other reviewers did.  I must say, our waitress was a delight.

There are things that they are getting right and other items that you would have thought would have been worked out by now. 

The good - I did have the Chilean Sea bass and that was great, my husband has a pizza that was good.  The view of the winery is great and it is a beautiful  building. 

The not so good: Service. We waited almost 10 minutes at our table (high top table). And they were almost empty. Since we came for the wine, we asked to taste one before we ordered the bottle. The server came out with one glass. 2 glasses (with just enough to taste) would have been better. The parking was brutal. It&#39;s all free valet which is cool, but you would think they were trying to valet in the city vs the county. Our car got parked in and they had to move no less than 5 cars plus we played chicken with cars coming in (they had no where to go). Again I will say that they were not packed so I do not understand the problem with valet parking. Our bill for 2 entrees (one a pizza), appetizer, and bottle was over a hundred with tip. 

Overall - I don&#39;t think we will be back. Service was a big reason.

I think what they need is some partitions; its just a big open space like, well, a banquet hall.  Has a total lack of intimacy.  Plus, the tables and chairs are purely banquet hall which surely does not help.  Pity, seeing as how they clearly spent a fortune on this place.  Food was not bad, certainly not great.

We also dined at the restaurant and it was delicious.  Only gripe being the cheese/meat tray for $9.50 had 4 itty bitty triangles all of the same cheese, disappointed with that.   The pasta was fresh, olive oil on the table delicious and the limoncillo... PERFECT.

The shop on the premises that sells their wine and other items is adorable and the lady running it couldn&#39;t have been any nicer!  It was like walking in and immediatly having a friend.

The gentleman, term used loosely, who was wearing the blue striped shirt and the apparent manager was extremely rude to me and was demeaning towards me at the end of the evening. The food was sub par at best. My prime rib was over cooked which was obviously cut and placed into a hotbox after slicing, confirmed by the wait staff. Prime Rib or any other whole protein should not be cut until the plate is walking out for service. My wife&#39;s fish was over cooked and complete mush and these sentiments were shared by many other wedding guests. For the price paid per entree for these items the food was not at the quality it should have been. I was also informed that the Executive Chef Vincenzo was not there to supervise the food being served which is unbelievable when someone has a 200 person guest list. The service staff was exceptional and their embarrassment in serving the food served was apparent and expressed by several members of staff. The pizza was great as was the vegetables served on all plates. However the unprofessionalism exhibited by the man in the blue shirt who would not give me his name was very unbecoming and detrimental to the establishments already lackluster reputation. I also thought that it was tacky that the owner allowed people into the establishment, who were not guests of the wedding.  This was observed by and commented on by several guests. I know that owner is attempting to open a restaurant in sycamore and if these business practices are attempted there the business will not be welcomed.   I hope that these areas are corrected at this location and at the Sycamore location so that a viable contribution can be made to the  community, I also hope that the currently pending issues with non payment of services for several of the trade work positions are fulfilled, as this is  of growing concern for many people who frequent the establishment, as well as many potential customers.

Kind of confusing as to where you go - there are tables to the left and to the right...the left has a gift area spread around the perimeter.

I was there with some friends. They asked for separate checks and we all know how that goes - not well. First, we ordered drinks, now remember we are at a vineyard. Those who ordered pop and iced tea got it almost immediately. This who ordered wine waited almost 40 minutes. Then came the food, everyone seemed to enjoy their lunch - salads, paninins, pizza etc. The service though was HORRIBLE, some of the food came out, some did not , the waitress never got the orders right which meant food went back, etc.

Then came time for the checks, 45 minutes later no one had the right one, she forgot to charge for the wine, etc.

Then we went over to do the tasting, no one was there, the tasting list showed about half were sold out, so we left.

We had each heard that service was terrible, but the place was not even 25% full, so we figured how bad could it be? Bad!

I am not a wine lover of midwest wines, but my companions were happy with the choices.  Interesting menu, not expensive, : Paninis, salads, Italian entrees and wood burning stove pizzas.  
Service was performed by young wait staff that were not that attentive.   I give it 5 stars for circus and 3 stars for bread.   
Double check to see if they are open on Sundays, they do close for &#34;special events&#34;. 
Avoid the crowds and dine at Lunch instead of Dinner."

There has been a vineyard here for several years and the winery itself has been under construction for a couple of years.

We arrived right at noon and there weren&#39;t many people there. As we walked up the stairs we were greeted by a young man whose job appeared to be to open the door for us. Upon entering the winery we were immediately transformed to Italy by the ornately-detailed decor inside. The domed entrance reminded us of the ceiling in the Sistine Chapel. The columns resembled marble. The first impression was breath-taking. We were greeted and escorted past the wine-tasting area, the grand piano and the brick pizza oven. There is a terrace outside but we chose to sit inside as it was a bit humid outside. I was fortunate enough to be the person facing south so I had a view of the vineyard across Lincoln Highway which added to the Italian feel of the meal.

We were given a basket of bread and individual dishes of dipping oil and what appeared to be freshly grated Parmesan (I thought it would have been a nice touch if they had grated it freshly at the table but this was lunch and maybe they do that at dinner time or maybe they did and I wasn&#39;t watching?).

I am not much of a wine drinker and Mary, who is the most Italian person I know personally doesn&#39;t seem to be either. So Jill is the only one of us who ordered the wine. She had the Piacere (red) and she liked it very much..I think she had two glasses with lunch.

They had a nice lunch menu and Jill ordered an artichoke pizza from their extensive pizza selections. They seemed to be kind of designer pizzas and she shared it with Mary and I as her pizza arrived well before our food. The waiter explained that the pizza arrived earlier because it&#39;s cooked in a different oven (the brick fire oven we saw upon entering). My thought would have been to maybe not put the pizza in right away so that the meals could have been brought out together.

I ordered the baked artichoke hearts topped with mozzarella and Mary had a sandwich that looked like a Caprese sandwich with red peppers and a bowl of soup. We talked and shared our food and were there for quite a while. The place got very busy but that seemed, mostly, because there was a Porsche rally of some sort and this was a stop on their tour. 

Mary and I both initially ordered the Crab Cakes that were one of the specials of the day but were disappointed when the waiter came back and said &#34;the chef isn&#39;t ready to make them yet.&#34; Then why were they mentioned as one of the specials?

Jill&#39;s pizza was excellent and my baked artichoke heart dish was superb. I did not try Mary&#39;s sandwich as I think I filled up on the bread and dipping oil. In fact, at one point I asked for a second basket of bread. The waiter seemed put out by this. The new basket of bread was not warm and toasty like the first basket and it took longer to arrive than expected. It was clearly a different bread. I was willing to pay for the new basket of bread if that was the issue.

After dinner we went and browsed through their store. They have wines made on the property, of course, and they had interesting food items and a very nice selection of cigars. We decided to do a wine-tasting. It was $6.00 each for six one-ounce pours (six different wines). We tasted three whites (Prairie Star, Bianco Bello and Brianna) and three reds (Vitino, Piacere and Frontenac). Jill loved the Vitino. She loves, and regularly drinks, a wine called Beaujolais Villages and this wine is a Beaujolais-style wine. Though I am not a wine drinker for some reason I want to be a wine drinker because of the romance of drinking wine. Jill says that &#34;you just need to find a wine that suits your pallet.&#34; It&#39;s kind of a quest I guess.  I did like the Prairie Star and Bianco Bello okay. The only thing that I found negative with the tasting is that the palette-cleanser (bread sticks) were stale. But, I am not normally a wine-taster and maybe that is by design?

Overall the foods and the experience were fabulous. I did not find it expensive but other people have told us that they thought it was expensive. We were there for lunch and the others had gone there for dinner so maybe that is a different menu with different prices. I would recommend Acquaviva Winery for anyone who is looking to take a drive just a bit west of Route 47. The food is great, the scenery is amazing (especially for where it is located) and I found it moderately priced. There were the few glitches that I mentioned here but they are newly-opened and they are probably still fine-tuning.  Bravissimo!"

My parents have been frequent customers in the past - a big fan of the calamari and pizzas.  The distinguishing factor of this place is really the incredible service.  My dad passed away and we desired to throw him a Celebration of Life. We wanted to host the celebration at Acquaviva since he loved the place - the owner (Vito) and the rest of the staff so much. Vito told us (with just a week&#39;s notice) that he would do whatever we needed. He delivered. His staff - Erin and the rest of the crew were truly exceptional.  They treated us as if we were a member of their own family.  The event was emotional and they were so kind and understanding.  The service and compassion truly made the experience special and worthwhile. After seeing how they went out of their way to help us and deliver under such short notice, will make me a lifetime customer.  I encourage everyone to stop in and appreciate a restaurant with rare warmth, care and good wine and food!!!"

Management and service were the worst we have experienced in years!!! In today&#39;s economy every business owner should ensure an enjoyable experience to secure repeat business. Acquaviva plays by alternate rules...they don&#39;t care if the customer is happy. We waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged by our server. She simply took our order and then asked if we &#34;wanted the side salad that comes with our dinners&#34;...um, yes? My husband&#39;s meal had to be returned three times and by the time it was ready for consumption, I had finished my entree, wine and glass of water. No one ever asked if I wanted another glass or anything else, while my husband was eating! We asked to speak to the manager at this point. A woman approached our table, did not introduce herself and offered a gift card towards our next meal. When we said we weren&#39;t sure we would return, she asked what we would like her to do. My husband said the service was the main problem and the uncooked meal was the second and put the ball back in her court. She actually argued with us and tried to justify the lack of service because it was Mother&#39;s Day and they were overwhelmed. She said, &#34;You want me to take the meal off the check? You&#39;ve eaten half of it already!&#34; She sent us the check and a complimentary bottle of wine. The server informed us the bottle of wine was on them and she took 50% off my husband&#39;s meal. When we looked at the check, she took off 50 CENTS! We had to have them correct this &#39;mistake&#39;. Then the presumed owner came over and was incredibly defensive. He was assuring us he knows he has the best steak in the city. We weren&#39;t questioning the quality. We were completely put off by the service and the fact the meal had to be returned THREE times! He asked us if he could buy us some more wine. My husband and I insisted we just wanted to provide him with feedback and we were not there for handouts. He wrote us off and it was obvious he wanted us to leave just as badly as we wanted to. Since we both had to visit the bathroom and we were still wanting something sweet, they did not offer us any desert and/or coffee at the end of our meal, we stopped at the nearest McDonald&#39;s for a friendly bathroom and a little milk shake action. DO NOT GO HERE!!! COMPLETELY OVERPRICED AND OVERWHELMED!"

Our waiter, Jake, was excellent and when he asked us what type of wine we liked, I told him and he brought out his recommendation, the Don Giuseppe.  It was perfect.  He also brought us a sample of two other reds and we liked the one he brought us the best.  He was very knowledgeable of both the wines and the menu.  I had the Zuppa di Mare.  Generous portion of mussels, clams, shrimp, fish, octopus, and squid in a flavourful broth with spaghetti.  It was fantastic.  I brought a portion of it home with me.  My husband had the Chilean sea bass which he said was excellent.  We split a piece of tiramisu for dessert.  We will definitely go back.  The only reason I give it 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because it&#39;s a bit noisy -- with the high ceilings there is a constant din.  Would be nice if they could dampen the sound a bit.  Also, we were seated at a high top (our whole room was high tops) which gave it more of a bar feel as opposed to intimate dining.  But it was comfortable and we were able to hear each other fine.  The other room looked to be all regular tables.  Overall, great food and great service!"

We felt like we were in Italy...or at least on vacation! Our server, Jessica, was perfect-friendly, helpful &amp; attentive! I was torn between 2 white wines when Riesling was not on the wine list. I chose the Bianco Bello &amp; was very pleased!  The hubby had a tasty Moretti beer. Bread &amp; Olive Oil upon our arrival was great! The bruschetta was delicious! Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t care for the Caesar Salad due to the unsavory taste of the dressing. I had the Fettucini with broccoli (broccoli on the side) which was excellent! My hubby had a steak with garlic mashed potatoes which was also excellent. My 2nd &amp; only other negative was that a worker combined my Fettucini WITH the broccoli in my &#34;doggy bag&#34; . Since I ordered the broccoli on the side, I assumed that they would be wrapped separately in my to go container. This is a great place to go on a date or celebrate a special occasion.

Service..... Well there isn&#39;t any. Nothing like waiting to see your waitress to place your drink order for at least take 30 minutes. Don&#39;t worry the owner will walk around and watch while his customers leave angry while doing nothing to help his understaffed establishment. 

Monday night is pizza night but they only have two ovens! What a joke! So don&#39;t order more than two pizzas or you will be eating in shifts. But other peoples pizza will also come out while you still wait on your completed order. Do you like hair as an addition topping on your pizza too??  What a pleasant surprise after waiting more than an hour and a half for three pizzas but a blond hair wrapped around burnt chicken and cheese!

Smoking, if you enjoy eating while every person around you enjoys a cancer stick this is your place! Enjoy the fume filled aroma while you wait. And the wait will be LONG!

Over charged! Watch your bill! Charged me double and when questioned they were like oh sorry about that. One thing after another. 

The  best thing this place had was the last waitress Frankie that was left to clean up everyone else&#39;s disaster. 

Won&#39;t be back until they close their doors. Great location that has so much potential but squandered! I&#39;m sure the bank will own this gem in no time."

I love the service here. The servers and bartenders are all women and they are all great. Ask for Alfie to take care of you guys when you&#39;re there. She&#39;s fast and great at remembering everything even on a busy night! Was here with a group of friends for my friends 21st birthday. It was laid back at first then towards the end of the night there was live music and a cover band which was so awesome. The crowd here is a good mix and seriously everybody is friendly. EVERYBODY. I mean everyone was so nice. You didn&#39;t have to worry about getting into a fight if someone bumped into by accident. It was seriously refreshing here.

FOOD: I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with a cup of pasta and sausage soup. That really hit the spot. I just hated that the door kept swinging open so it cooled off my food more than I had wish it did. My food didn&#39;t stay hot for more than 5 minutes :( oh well... I thought it was still good.

DRINKS: It&#39;s nice to pay for cheap strong drinks. $3 drinks 7$ pitchers. There specials here are decent and probably hard to beat.

No one acknowledged us.  Another couple sat down and got drinks right away.  We saw another couple go upstairs so that is were we headed.  Someone left the windows open and it was freezing up there, but there was a server.  We ordered the filet mignon and shivered until our food came.  We ordered our meat medium well, which is a small amount of pink.  Our meat came and it was charbroiled on the outside and raw on the inside.  Not pink but blood red!

They do serve breakfast which is awesome and they make a great bloody!  Say hi to Fred and take care of your bartenders!  My friends and I love this bar and go here often.  At one point, we were here every Thursday with all of our closest friends!"

Charming bar with a tin ceiling, old and worn in a lovely and comfortable way.  We have not experienced the beer garden yet as it&#39;s seems to be a younger crowd.   Don&#39;t be fooled by appearance of the menu. At first I though &#39;oh it&#39;s typical pub grub&#39;.  I could not be more wrong.  The food is really good!    My husband loves the pork tenderloin sandwich which is tough to find in this part of the state.  It&#39;s pounded thin and breaded and served on a bun with lettuce, tomato, pickle, etc.   The cajun shrimp and mashed potatoes is fantastic, as is the Friday fish fry.  The prices can&#39;t be beat and the beer selection is excellent.    I&#39;m giving three stars because it&#39;s not the cleanest place and it&#39;s hit or miss with the servers/bartenders."

Now the food:  Loved the fact they are grilling their wings which added a nice flavor since the amount of sauce was weak on heat and portion.  Fillet steak was a great size for the price point, the pork tenderloin sandwich was good and fresh and all the fried food tasted of being cooked in clean oil.  Also, the grilled steak tasted like it was cooked on a clean grill. Very nice to see considering Jim&#39;s may look a tad divey from the inside and out.

We found Diamond Jim&#39;s and were super excited that they had a pretty big beer garden(at least it looks like it in pictures) We walked in and the bar was empty except for one couple eating. We decided to go outside to the beer garden and that was where all the people were!!! They did not have an open table or even a place to sit at the bar, so we were forced to sit inside and eat. We sat at the bar and sat for a while beforethe bartender came over and asked us what we wanted.....now remember the place was empty and they had 3 people behind the bar.....kinda annoying. We ordered our drinks and then put in our food, I ordered buffalo chicken with tator tots..HOORAY!!! the food came out really fast and super hot. Everything tasted really good....for bar food, my only problem with the food was that the chicken needed more buffalo sauce on it. 
My friend is a smoker so he wanted to go outside really quick and since I didnt want to sit by myself I just went outside with him. While we were outside the bartender actually came out and asked if we wanted another drink for when we came inside....I thought this was really nice of her and nice that it was waiting for us when we got back inside.
I will be coming back but I&#39;m hoping that we can get a table outside in the beer garden to enjoy the music and weather!!"

They book great musicians, and they have a nice selection of drinks.  The patio is decorated with a Cubs theme, complete with an ivy covered wall, but it also has an island feel to it due to the beach-style bar and wooden booths.

The location (on Main St.) is convenient, and in addition to the restaurant&#39;s small parking lot out back, there is a public lot just up the street, and street parking on Main as well.  We&#39;ve been in on different days throughout the week - some days are busier than others (Fridays typically have more people in the place, although there was a group playing pool last night), but it&#39;s usually not too loud, and the service is generally pretty quick.  (There usually are only 1-2 waiters plus a bartender or two visible, but they stop by often with refills and chips).

The main reason we keep coming in / ordering from CTG is the food.  When eating in, we&#39;re big fans of the fajitas (combination or just chicken), and last night they were gracious enough to even make my husband&#39;s order with just red peppers and onions (no green peppers).  The chips and salsas (3 kinds) they bring out while you wait are awesome - we usually end up eating way too many way too quickly because they&#39;re fresh and kind of addictive!  I also love the enchiladas enchipoltadas (cheese with chipotle sauce) and the chicken flautas.  The portions on all the food are nicely sized, and come with rice, beans, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, guacamole, and a few slices of orange and cucumber on the side.  When ordering for carry out or delivery, we typically stick to tacos, nachos, and choriqueso, all of which travel pretty well.

Definitely recommended!  And if you&#39;re into Pokemon Go, just know you can reach the Downtown Dogs Pokestop from most seats in the restaurant...  :)"

The decor is not extravagant, so the ambiance is alright. We went on an early Friday evening and the musicians were good but they played slow-lost-my-job-my wife-and I need to get drunk type of music. They need to play more upbeat music. The waiter was okay, needs to work on a few things. What kept us positive was Tony, the food, and the drinks(margarita&#39;s &amp; Micheladas). Tony being the second waiter that struck conversion with us and was a lot more of a people person. First waiter needs to learn from this. The mole was UNBELIEVABLE! The flautas were great according to my wife.
Why not five stars? The first waiter needs more experience and motivation. The agua de horchata was horrible. The woman&#39;s bathroom reeked like sewer. It&#39;s not pleasant to eat after going in the bathroom. 
We will go back because of the food and Tony. Hopefully they fix their main issue, BATHROOM!"

The waiter was nice but the service was not good and the food was mediocre at best.
INTERIOR
I&#39;m not a demanding person when it comes to decor. That&#39;s why I wasn&#39;t put off by the interior of this place. It is like a long, wide hallway with booths or tables on either side of the wall. It didn&#39;t look good but we were told that the food was great so we decided to give it a shot.
CLEANLINESS
Our booth was not ready. All the booths and tables had hot sauces, ketchup, salt, pepper etc but ours didn&#39;t and we didn&#39;t even get those the hwole time we were there. The booth seat was dirty too, I had to use a few napkins to clean it off.
SERVICE
Our order was taken first but somehow 2 other parties that were seated after we put our order in, got their food before we us. It also took a while for us to get our food. We also noticed waiters taking orders to the wrong tables and trying to figure out who ordered what.
I even overheard a waiter asking a couple seated behind us &#34;But the service is getting better though, right?&#34; which means that they know they have issues with their service. Unfortunately, I think those issues have not been yet fixed.
FOOD
When we did get our food, we were not impressed at all. My chicken tacos smelled like fish (I was worried that it was cooked in a pan that was used to cook shrimp as well) and the burrito was cold in the middle. Also, the tortilla chips that were served smelled like old, overused oil. My Margarita was very good though.

I thought I was going to get some authentic Mexican food in this place but after what I had, I realized that Chipotle is way better."

There were 3 guys taking care of all the tables. Our main server was a really nice guy but that is overshadowed by mediocre, bland food. I was nearly done with my food when my mango margarita finally came out. I got the margarita frozen but it had big chunks of ice and I couldn&#39;t drink it with a straw because the ice kept getting caught. At one point I had to get up to find someone to refill our drinks and get my son some ketchup for his burger which we asked for when our food came out. The biggest kicker is they use cell phones (I&#39;m assuming personal ones) to take your order, show your bill AND swipe your card. Umm...no thanks. We paid cash and won&#39;t be back."

We actually thought the place closed before it opened because one day the &#34;coming soon&#34; sign was down &amp; the place looked dark.  We had to take to Yelp to see what was going on to find out that it had been opened for a few months.

My hungrier half decided that he wanted to try out Carlos&#39; for his birthday dinner, so we checked it out.  The atmosphere is eclectic; I swear their tables and chairs are from other chain restaurants (Chili&#39;s tables, Champs Chairs), which sort of adds to the charm of the place.  It is HUGE, almost too big.  When we walked in, there were about half a dozen tables that were occupied &amp; the rest was empty space.
 
The food and drinks were pretty standard, Americanized Mexican fare.  Their margaritas were sort of indistinguishable from other places.  The chips &amp; salsa was pretty tasty &amp; came with 3 kinds of salsa (pico de gallo, salsa verde, and &#34;hot&#34; red salsa).  The chips were fresh &amp; warm, homemade tasting, if not actually homemade.  The salsa had a little kick to it but wasn&#39;t hot by any stretch of the imagination.  My mother-in-law was less than impressed with their chicken tacos, which she said lacked seasoning (even salt?).  They were out of the mole, which I&#39;m hoping means that it is good, so I got chicken enchiladas.  The shredded chicken was pretty tasty.

I&#39;d go back to try to mole, but nothing that we had made me want to run back in a hurry.  If you&#39;re looking for decent Mexican food that&#39;s not offensive, Carlos is your guy."

The chile relleno, with the combo platter that also included a tamale and a taco was delicious. The meat was very tender, the sauce on the chile was amazing. 

The bistec a la mexicana was excellent, it was a perfect balance of meat and vegetables, very tender meat and like the chile relleno, the sauce was perfect.

The service was very friendly, quick and attentive and we were never left needing drink refills or more chips and salsa.

Several of the other tables were Mexican families, and that is always a good sign to me when trying out a new Mexican restaurant that the food is authentic and tasty!  

I ordered the chicken enchiladas mole, one friend got combination #2 and my other friend got a steak burrito platter.  We were all very happy with what we ordered.  Portion size was on the large side.  Indeed, an order of enchiladas at most Mexican restaurants is 3 enchiladas, but at Carlos&#39; it is 4.  Good thing for me, because I had leftovers for lunch today! 

They had a guitarist playing (and occasionally singing) during dinner.  He was performing when we got there at 5:30 and I believe he played until 7:30. He was quite good! 

A few constructive criticisms:  The carne asada/steak burrito platter was priced a bit high at $15.95.  The enchiladas and combo plate were appropriately priced at $11.50, in my opinion.   I can see paying a slight upcharge for steak, but $4 seems a bit much. 

I ordered a Diet Coke and it tasted a bit weird.  I tried drinking it, but it tasted like it had sweet &amp; sour mix in it.  I asked for a replacement and the replacement tasted the same.  Then the waiter told me that when they refilled the tanks they had at first hooked cranberry juice up to the Diet Coke pump by mistake-- and it still kind of tastes like that.  Not a big deal for me, as long as I knew what the odd flavor was, but it could potentially be an issue for a diabetic or someone with an allergy to cranberries.  Hopefully after a little more use the Diet Coke line will be sufficiently flushed to get rid of the cranberry juice flavor. 

We enjoyed our meal (and the guitar performance) at Carlos Tequila Grill and I&#39;m looking forward to dining there with my family soon."

When cooking the steak all you need is a little salt and pepper! PLEASE JUST ADD SOME SEASONING! This place has such potential! The chips were homemade and good just again needed salt.

The restaurant is huge. The staff is extremely friendly and eager to please.  It looks like they have a very large room off the main dining area where they can have banquets.  We will definitely be going back."

I was nice and waited a few more minutes to show up. He never did. TWO HOUR later there was still no delivery. I called the store, told her what happened.  She offered to remake it and send it out but by this time it&#39;s late so I ask her to cancel it and refund my money. She says ok and hungs up on me. As of today I have not received my refund. 

I called again and spoke to the manager,  Summeria. I explained everything and she says she can&#39;t give me my money back because I ordered online. The charge is from them not a 3rd party. She still doesn&#39;t ask my name or even attempt to refund me and says I have to come in person. At this point I&#39;m angry. I said I was super polite up to now and I wasn&#39;t bitching but this is ridiculous. She hangs up on me again for saying &#34;bitching.&#34; 

I call back,  ask for the owner. Of course he&#39;s not available. I ask for his name and when he will be in. She won&#39;t give this information either.

An hour passed before we even saw a waitress, 90 minutes before our drinks were served.
Then our waitress refused to continue serving us when one of our group only ordered soup.
She snipped that there is a minimum $15 purchase per person, something that was not mentioned when the reservation was made OR at anytime while we sat there waiting 90 minutes for someone to take our dinner order. After talking to a manager we were assigned a different waitress and then staff came and tossed flyers on the table that said &#34;we ASK for a minimum purchase of $15 pp.&#34;  Key would there - &#34;ASK&#34;!! 
Our new waitress did ok, especially since she was thrown into a very confusing situation, however at this point it&#39;s two hours in before we received out soup/salad and after they were finally served she came to our table and asked if we had now received everything we ordered to which the entire table replied &#34;uh, no - how about our dinners!&#34;

Tonight a group of five of us ate here. Of the five meals we ordered three had mistakes.  My fiancé ordered the crispy chicken platter and they brought out the fried chicken. The waiter was new and said he rang it in wrong. An honest mistake, normally wouldn&#39;t bat an eye. But it got much much worse. 

Two of us ordered the same burger (the Manhattan royal burger) and both burgers came out missing different toppings. One was missing the mayo and the crispy onions and the other was missing bacon and mayo. When I asked to speak with a manager a young man (the &#34;manager&#34;) came over and told me that crispy onion rings were not supposed to come on my burger and that bacon didn&#39;t come on my friend&#39;s burger. Again, we ordered the same burger. He then rushed off and told us we would get our burgers with whatever we wanted on it soon. One of the burgers came back missing the onion rings again and neither ever ended up with mayo. 

The worst part of it though was when I went and got a menu and showed the manager that the Manhattan Royal burger did in fact come with everything we had asked for he did not apologize, he did not offer any sort of compensation for the mistake and he never came back to our table (I had to track him down to show him his own menu). 

Just so no one gets the wrong idea; they were not busy tonight. In fact most of the rest of the evening I could see the &#34;manager/supervisor&#34; sitting at the bar casually listening to the band.

The egg/pepper sandwich on their on-line menu doesn&#39;t appear on the actual menu.  

That said, they were extremely accommodating, and there are items you can modify (chicken/portabella panini, hold the chicken, etc.) to easily come up with a couple of other vegetarian options.  I ordered the nachos over a baked potato instead of over corn chips and the waitress didn&#39;t even blink. We had a group of 12-14 people with separate checks, and she was willing to combine some of them so I could use a coupon (which I hadn&#39;t mentioned when ordering), in addition to dealing with my custom nachos and wanting a larger glass for my drink (IBC and Jagermeister - what a good idea!).  She kept everyone&#39;s water glasses filled too.  

The bread/butter (real butter) brought out while you wait is tasty if bland (it&#39;s white bread, nice crust); they&#39;ll bring more if you ask.

I can&#39;t give them more than 3 stars because there&#39;s so little I can eat here, but they have many redeeming features, and if you like steak or pot roast, it&#39;s probably a great place."

And I&#39;m not quite sure why that hasn&#39;t changed cuz the one meal I had here was pretty amazing. 

Swordfish is my absolute favorite, so when I saw it on the specials I obviously had to try it. They also had paired it with a strawberry salsa-ish deal. Amazing. Plus, I still got a baked potato and some kinda rice deal. It was a lot of food!

I will probably try to make a point to get out there again, and secretly hope they will have the same special even though that would mean I wouldn&#39;t try something else on their menu..."

We had such a great experience, I wanted to make sure that I reviewed it.  The hostess asked if we wanted to be seated near the TVs because a football game was on.  We said no, so we were seated in a booth up in a quieter area.  Service was excellent.  She was obviously an experienced server.  Our soft drinks were delivered quickly.  I liked the extra large size glasses.  Even with that, our server offered to refill our drinks when our glasses were about half empty.

My husband had the pot roast dinner and I had the pot roast sandwich.  Both meals were delicious.  I especially loved the warm bread with butter that came out with our soup and salad.  We both left stuffed and satisfied.

The lighting and atmosphere in here is perfect. If you are looking for a fancy occasion, or just to go out and have a few drinks I highly recommend it. The Calamari is one of our favorite appetizers it is so good! Last time I was here I ordered the Prime Rib that was on special last Saturday the 9th. It was an amazing melt in your mouth delicious Prime Rib. Her parents also ordered the all you can Eat Ribs and the Scallops and both of those dishes were excellent too. The beer I ordered on draft was two hearted ale and it was really fresh tasting. Every time we are here the Beer is good and the food is top notch for the price you can not beat it. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get a good meal. If you ever get a chance to Meet Sindy the owner you will see she is a passionate business owner and really cares about her customers that eat there. Also I would recommend asking for Stefanie as a Server We have had her 2 other times while we were here  before and she was on top of our order for us and never let us go with out a drink the Customer Service provided is one of the best you will see. This time we had another server but she also was Exceptional you really can not go wrong with service here. Even sitting at the bar you will find the Bar Tender is really friendly and outgoing."

It&#39;s another place I really wanted to like but just couldn&#39;t.  I like the decide and atmosphere, but the food is really lacking.  It&#39;s not horrible, but it&#39;s so bland.  
I never, ever put salt on anything. This was the first place ever I had to salt my food.  We  had the following:
Saganaki- it was the appetizer they touted as a customer favorite.  I&#39;ve had better, I&#39;ve had worse.  
Mushroom soup- this came with my meal. It was ok. You could almost taste the thickener in it though and really bland.
Chicken Marsala-my dinner.  All in all ok, but the chicken was a little tough, and again.....bland.  It came with frozen green beans that were fine.
The missus had a pot roast sandwich.  It was the smallest thing I ever saw, like kids menu small.  It was dry and you guessed it, full of flavor....no I&#39;m kidding it was bland too.
All in all the bill was something like 66 bucks for 2 meals and 4 drinks (one was pop).  Definitely not worth the price.

While we were waiting for a table we had a drink at the bar.   I noted a few things here: both bartenders took dirty plates from customers and never washed there hands after doing so, both scooped ice using a glass!, both consistently grabbed clean classes from the inside before making someones drinks, one was eating behind the bar while making drinks!,  and they both, after touching their hair and faces grabbed straws and fruit barehanded and put them into drinks! In the time we sat there, about 30 minutes, neither one washed their hands even once!!  Anyone with a basic knowledge on how viruses and bacteria get transferred to customers would know this is a huge no no!  This is a good illness outbreak waiting to happen!  The fish fry was ok but nothing to right home about.  Service was good.  Overall, this place caters to the over 50 grows.  To top it off, I found a fly in my water after drinking half of it! Gross!!

Today I went here for lunch using my Groupon.  A big thumbs up on all the changes from my last visit.  I would have given 5 stars, but our server was a little flighty, forgetting some plates and my salad dressing.  Most of the lunch specials are $6.99!

First of all, the remodel makes the place so much brighter and roomier.  It is very welcoming when you walk in and we were greeted immediately by the owner.  Our server came over pretty quickly after we sat down which is a big improvement over my past experiences.

We had bruschetta for an appetizer and it was GREAT.  The bread was nice and soft, not that rock hard crunchy kind you get and the toppings were very flavorful. 

I had a cobb salad, I know pretty boring.  It was HUGE.  I will be eating the other half for dinner.  Hubby had a prime rib sandwich which he thoroughly enjoyed.  Our server checked in with us frequently to see if we needed more beverages or extra napkins.

I can&#39;t say enough about the HUGE improvement in our dining experience.   Be sure to check out the bruschetta when you are there."

Ordered a burger and a turkey reuben. Both were very good! Lunchtime service was under 10 mins. Host and waitress were very attentive to drinks and such.

The decor inside seemed to be relatively new. I am definitely going to go back and try something new. They have a ton of specials and it seems on the sign outside that they always have some sort of event/all you can eat going on (Not good for the nation&#39;s obesity crisis, but oh well...)

The last 2 times were so-so with food and experience.  A lot of people I know really seem to enjoy this place, and I still haven&#39;t seen why.  So, this LAST time (because I will never return again), my best friend and I decided to give it one more shot.  Though we were seated promptly, it took about 4 minutes for someone to even come and greet us at the table.  After we got our &#34;greeting&#34;,( which she never said Hello, or what her name was..), we decided to order some martini&#39;s.  *sidenote-we were sitting in the bar area*  It then took and I kid you not, 10 MIN to receive our drinks.  TEN MINUTES!!  There was only one other booth filled besides us and 2 gentlemen at the bar.  I think the bartender was too concerned to eat his dinner then to tend to his guests.  Finally receiving our drinks, we put our food order in.  I ordered a filet cooked medium plus, and a garden salad.  My friend ordered a chicken wrap and a cup of soup.  Pretty simple right?  WRONG!!  It took ANOTHER 10 MINUTES to get our soup and salad, and when the soup was delivered, there was some dried food on the spoon.  Now, our waitress didn&#39;t stop back to check on us, so I took it among myself to ask the &#34;oh so busy&#34; bartender for a new spoon.   Of course no apology or anything, just plopped the new spoon on the table and I said politely &#34;thank you so much&#34;, which he proceeded to roll his eyes and walk away.  Now I have my timer on my phone going ( I forgot to mention that earlier), so these times are NOT exaggerated, I restarted my timer after we got our soup and salad.  The time it took to receive our entree...Ready for this...25MIN!!  At this point we are so angry, we didn&#39;t even want to eat, but our bellies were rumbling because we have now been sitting here for about an hour!  Now, of course my filet came out wrong, had to have it re-fired, and the waitress told me the horseradish sauce was my sour cream for the potato, but you know, minor details.  UGH.  I will never understand why everyone loves this place so much.  I don&#39;t get it.  So, unless you are over 50 and look like you have money, you might get treated with respect.  If you are in your 30s trying to enjoy a nice dinner, I might recommend Outback or Olive Garden."

However, I was overwhelmed with exactly what I wanted to write about in terms of a bad Easter Brunch experience.  

First off, the spacial function for this event was UNfunctional.  They had sat our party of 11 in the corner length wise and the hostess let me know that we could separate our table to better get in and out for the buffet.  okay... 
then when our party was complete, we set off to the buffet.  that was a line out the door and around the galley style bar.  Anyone belly up at the bar could not leave, the servers could not access the service bar and I felt very uncomfotable and unsteady with a plate of food I was trying to dish up as we moo&#39;ed thru the line.  They definitely could have come up with a better system.
The line began behind the hostess stand with desserts then filtered on past the bar to 1st up, fried chicken.  
after that was a buffet setting full of eggs.  that looked green.  if there was a green eggs and ham theme, I wouldn&#39;t have known because the carving station was last.  I was relieved when I saw the gal come thru with fresh eggs.  but she dumped them on top of the old eggs.  the same thing happened with the crumbled dry bacon that was dumped on top of old very crumpled very dry bacon.
same thing with the pancakes.  
By the time I finished thru the line I couldn&#39;t help but be green with the thoughts of contamination. I helped myself to 2 pieces of french toast and some 3/4 slice of bacon.  I skipped over the carving station because of the push and pull of the line.  I was hungry and figured perhaps I could go back when the line wasn&#39;t so full. on Easter. prolly wishful thinking on my part.
Right next to our table was a fabulous soup and salad table. thank gawd!  the creamy chicken dumpling soup satisfied and the salad was good.  I even saw the waiter bring more soup in a new pot, not just dump new on top of old.  That was the saving grace.  Thankfully my father in law payed the bill but I still felt as though I should ask for something considering the one piece (2 halves) of french toast that I ate was like crewing on concrete.  I was hoping to pay for soup/salad combo instead of the full buffet price of almost $20.  I would have happily paid and tipped for what I ate... love you Daddy!
We had 2 servers and their service was friendly and fast. Holidays can be a pain for us all.  We decided as a family that next year, perhaps we&#39;ll go out to eat on Easter Saturday instead.  that buffet was no good for anyone.  I should also mention that no one in our party of 11 went back for seconds."

I couldn&#39;t resist adding a saganaki burger to the Great Burger Hunt list.  The saganaki is flamed at the table per the usual ritual.   Unfortunately, the saganaki didn&#39;t add anything to the burger and was just too salty.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I really like saganaki but it just didn&#39;t work on a burger.  Although I ordered the burger medium, it arrived well done (translation - dry).  The fries were Burger King like in that they have that strange coating that makes them crunchy but not very tasty.  Had the fries been better I probably would have been less annoyed that the burger was overcooked.  My gf got a salad that came in an attractive bowl but had such a small base that it almost tipped over everytime she took a bite.  The complimentary bread was very good and the service attentive without being annoying.  We sat in the bar area and noticed plenty of HD tv&#39;s. 

Sadly the Groupon was not enough to make us repeat customers."

The place looks like it&#39;s been going since the early 80s and they haven&#39;t changed the scenery, actually kind of funny that this is the kind of place you can bring grandma and she would want to come back, not much of a young crowd but that&#39;s not always a bad thing."

I was disappointed in our server - which probably influenced my rating. She was extremely rude from the beginning. When she came up to us - she said &#34;Well, I guess I&#39;m your server.&#34; It was down hill from there.

We sat in the bar area, and there was a man who was loudly dropping the f-bomb in his conversation with his friend - extremely annoying. He did end up leaving when our food came - so that was a relief.

As far as the food (I had the Angel Hair Chicken dinner), it was a very large portion - but had no flavor.  I felt it needed some spices or even a little salt and pepper. 

In general - we had a bad experience with our server and the food was so-so.  We will not be back anytime soon, but I know we should give it another try - it may have just been a bad night."

I am trying to say Manhattan&#39;s general crowd is retirees, but maybe that&#39;s why it is fun.  The people, diners included are very kind and warm people.

The menu is fairly wide in selection, something for pretty much anyone.  I have had a few different dishes across the board and everything is quite good.  The prices are on par with the style, but nothing you&#39;ll be too overwhelmed either way with.

They do have wonderful daily deals however on both food and drink, check their website beforehand and you can get a really good meal at a more than generous price.  They also have great coupons that come in the coupon mailers every week that make for a great weekday retreat.

The remodel is nice, the bar area I think is nicer than the eating area which reminds me a little of a Baker&#39;s Square restaurant.

Service is very attentive, you&#39;ll never have to flag someone down for a refill or napkins.  The young girls serving seem to slack behind the older waitresses, but I see that everywhere and would rather always have the nice older woman than the 20 something girl who thinks she&#39;s hotter than she is.

Honestly, Manhattan&#39;s is a place I really enjoy, and do look forward to going back.  Both the bar and restaurant are nice for a bite or a drink, don&#39;t be afraid to give it a shot."

The shrimp in the shrimp cocktail is flavor-less; the toast in the bruschetta is soggy. Otherwise, the apps were decent. The saganaki app was interesting, but not sure what to eat it on ... we used some of the bread. The bread is awesome -- comes to the table nicely warm and crispy.

The ribeye steak was pretty good, cooked a near-perfect medium-rare. The big salads are really big. Pasta dishes are fair-sized as well, and apparently are pretty decent.

Not sure what people are talking about as far as the senior crowd here ... the group get-together was around 7 PM on a weekday, the 4-top was a Thursday evening, 8 PM or so I think, and on neither occasion did the place seem to be particularly senioritised."

I&#39;ve noticed service is different if a certain manager is on the floor or not. The soup is always good and the daily specials is a hit or miss. 

The other night I ordered the daily surf and turf special with steak and fried shrimp. Our food was taking FOREVER and when my food finally came out it was a lobster tail instead of shrimp. If I were a fan of lobster I would of kept it. My waitress realized she put the wrong order in and would find out the price difference. Told her that I would just like my shrimp instead. She contacted one of the managers and they told her that since its a $20 price difference. I figured after the long wait for the food and the food coming out wrong, they would of just kept the lobster on the table. They took the lobster back and got my shrimp. I know it was a big price difference but what was gonna happen to it anyway? If they took it back and made the waitress pay for it...i&#39;m not sure I just think that&#39;s just bogus."

The staff was very friendly and attentive. 

The food though was nothing special. I had the baked mostacolli. It was alright. Not good but not bad. The garlic bread had a strange taste to it though, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.

I had a cup of soup as well. The soup was flavorful but had sort of an odds and ends feel to it. All the ingredients were cut in different sizes so it seemed like they just kind dumped extras from the kitchen into a creamy broth.

My lunch actually came with bread served on a board (think Outback). When they brought it out I couldn&#39;t help but smile. It was pretty much a typical small, crusty dinner roll, on a board, with a big serrated knife poked into it. It was cute."

Last night my family decided though to go back and have us give it another try. First thing to note is they are doing a remodel so half the restaurant is closed and the dinning room is very crowded. We got put at a table in the middle and kept getting bumped by the servers as they waited on other tables. I&#39;m not factoring this into my star rating however as I feel this is just because the other half of the restaurant is closed for remodeling. So my reason for going was to get the Saganacki burger... Yes I know it should include a trip to the doctors office or at least a free shock to get my heart going again. While I must admit I never liked the burgers here in the past I found this one to be excellent. My burger was cooked perfectly and had a gregarious portion of Saganacki on top. It was also flamed table side which is always great. Surprisingly the person at the table next to us still had there hair with hot tight the seating was last night :) Over all I enjoyed my dinner and look forward to going back and getting that burger again."

Interior looks great, a lot nicer than I remember. The bar is now separate so dining can be a quiet experience. 
Haven&#39;t been to this restaurant in a few years. Had a coupon on a fundraising card.  Monday night - must be Sr. night.  A wide variety on the menu. Nice waitress, but then comes the plastic water glasses, and plastic plates, and silverware with no spoons - o.k. we are in a Bar/Grill and not a real restaurant.  A wide variety of Beers, and knowledgable staff.   Apparently their weekend entertainment is a big draw to their bar business. I told our waitress my husband was allergic to onions, we ordered appetizer of stuffed asigo mushrooms, and the chopped onions on top were easily removed.  Very tasty. His soup arrived - chicken tortilla and it had onions in it. He told the waitress, she came back and instead of bringing the asparagas cream soup she let us know she talked to the chef and onions are in that too, so she gave him a salad instead - good on her part.  He ordered a chicken pasta dish, no onions, and I ordered the Filet Marsala medium rare. I should of stuck wit Bar/Grill food... my mistake.   The dish was very tasty but not marsala, it was a generic brown gravy sause with mushrooms.  The meat was tender and cooked to order.  The sauted veggie mix was too oily for my tastes.  His chicken dish was excellent and brought some home because of the large portion.  I did not want potato so I asked for pasta instead. She brought a side of fettichini alfredo. It was FANTASTIC - the best part of the meal - creamy, no garlic, just wonderful!  Ashley was attentive, quick with refills, checking that all was o.k. but not rushed or hovering.  The place was clean, but could use the spring cleaning to get the edges of carpet dust against the pillars that the vacumn obviously doesn&#39;t pick up.  Overall a nice place with good service and good food, reasonable in price for todays market. Stick with the sandwiches and specials."

Sometimes the &#34;Cheer&#39;s&#34;-ish crowd at the bar can be a real pain the a$$!  Rude and obnoxious about the things they want on the TV amongst other things.

If you live in the Western burbs, watch that crappy &#34;Mr. Coupon&#34; packet, Manhattan&#39;s (not Manhatten, spelled incorrectly above) puts out a buy one/get one so you can try it on the cheap.  

Be kind; take your extra coupons with you and leave them about.

Shit was getting bleak in my world: I moved from a neighborhood in NYC that literally was rife with top-notch comidas Mexicanas muy authenticas (or something) and everything I&#39;d eaten Mex-wise since moving to Chicagoland had been MEH at best.

M&#39;lady found Taqueria Los Cocos and we finally got a chance to hit it this past weekend. Salsa was delicious and loaded with jalapeños. Chips were hearty and definitely homemade. Chile relleño burrito hit the mark. Guacamole was superb and fresh. M&#39;lady&#39;s veg sopes had a sweetness of yellow masa we hadn&#39;t encountered before, perhaps we&#39;d only really experienced white corn masa? Anyhoo, rice and beans were delicious, too, and service was fantastic.

Taqueria Los Cocos, you are my new best friend."

I&#39;ve lived in Algonquin for over 20 years, but now that I&#39;m married and renting the house out (removed all the furniture) I&#39;m actually trying other restaurants in the area! ;)

This one is a gem! Very nicely flavored foods and salsas, simple but comfortable decor, and friendly owners! Even being (at this time) solo in a small strip mall, it stands out as a colorful and welcoming place to eat.

I had been here before, but will review on only my last meal.

The service was good, and the complimentary chips / pico were excellent. I ordered a bottle of Tamarindo Jarrito&#39;s, which went well with my meal.

I tried a burrito, and opted for Chicken since it was something different for me. (Had tried steak and pastor in the past, and more normally) The meat was shredded, but still tasted moist and flavorful. A good portion size!

Red and Green salsas were both very good, with the red being in the &#39;excellent&#39; category. Green was tasty, but more of a &#39;mild&#39;, which for me was just not fun enough. ;)

The pricing was good as well. The entire meal was just over $7, and well worth it!

When you&#39;re driving down Route 25 and need a good meal, stop in and talk to Alan (or his mom, depending on the time of day) and enjoy a meal with smile."

It was a Monday so they had the $5 burritos special. Ordered three of their burritos to take home and share. Things sure have changed. The burritos used to be huge. Not anymore! They still use the 14in tortillas but now they just decide to only leave them 40% full. Cut it in half and its just tortilla folds! It was actually pretty funny to look at.

I ordered a chile relleno, lengua, and choriso. I have to admit all three were very very tasty in every way but one. I actually found a plastic wrapper in the middle of one of them. Im not talking a tiny little piece either. It was like a sandwich bag!!! I have never found anything like that in my food in my entire life. So that was a little off putting.... Would have gotten three stars maybe if they hold the plastic next time! But I wont be going back. Taste was good but don&#39;t like their new empty burrito approach.

This certainly is not a place you would go to for ambience or a fine wine or strolling musicians.  But in terms of the ratio of quality and taste to price it deserves 5 stars.

I had a side of refried beans:  very good.

One in our party had a side of guacomole:  delicious!

I almost always order the taco lunch special featuring three Mexican tacos ... the real Mexican tacos with arrachera steak, onions, cilantro, green sauce, some refried beans and rice.  

Another enormous hit with me is their chips and salsa.  The salsa is homemade, pretty hot and very good.

I intend no disrespect by that at all! Seriously - it is stellar. 

I am talking authentic and delicious food. 

The wait staff is stellar - they always remember your face and order. 

Yes telemundo is on the TV and no don&#39;t even bother to ask to change it. 

The red sauce is hotter than the green here. 

That&#39;s all you really need to know . . . just go! 

   Okay you want details?
      We will start chronologically - I have eaten 1/2 of one off their breakfast burritos.  It was massive.  I could not force myself to eat one more bite of the monster and it certianly was not because it was not wonderful.  From what i understand the co-worker I shared the other 1/2 with had to split it to be able to finish it between himself and someone else and they were full as well. But just wait it gets far better!.  
      The tacos is what it is all about - the litmus test of these type of places . . . I have eaten every variety they have, langua, chorizo, chicharron . . . okay fine, they have ground beef, chicken, and steak as well but try the fun stuff for yourself! At these prices you canny afford not to like it! (That being said I am a die hard steak taco man - cilantro and onion only please - don&#39;t gringo it up). 
      The Pico de Gallo - a.k.a. to whitey &#39;the salsa&#39; is freshly made there as well and is awesome fresh jalapenos, tomatoes, onions, yum! 
Now this might sound dumb BTU they even do the rice correctly. This is no small feat and another solid litmus test. 
I hate refried beans but I love theirs - someone please do NOT tell me what is in them. 
      Now at 5.99 what can you get? All the Pico and chips (also made there), with 3 tacos, refried beans, and the rice on Tuesdays. My office has begun calling Taco Tuesday for Pete&#39;s sake. (Wow I am lame but it is true!) 

      Anybody who even brings up Taco Bell may need to be punched in the nose."

I usually get the two taco dinner, varying what I put in them. The barbacoa is very good, as is the carnitas. The shredded chicken is a bit on the dry side. The beans and rice it comes with is very good as well. 

Look on the chalkboard above the cash register for weekly specials. We usually come here on Thursdays, which is quesadilla night. I haven&#39;t tried them but the folks I was with raved about them.

I have decided to start writing reviews on Yelp because, while I use the site frequently to read others reviews, I have found some times that the reviews are not reflective of my experience.  

My own imposed rules for any review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Must order something unique each visit.
3. If they have any &#34;signature&#34; items on the menu, you must order a &#34;signature&#34; item at least once.
4. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Beef Villa

Location/Layout - 6/10:  While there are 3 locations now; East Side, West Side, and South Elgin.  Growing up and presently I favor the West Side location.  Located directly across the street from Larkin High School on Larkin Avenue, the restaurant is easy to locate with the locally famous smiling dog road sign.  Parking is ample and they offer quick drive through service.  The dining area is your typical fast food joint using a glaring red, orange, and yellow color scheme with everything being either lacquer or hard plastic.  There have been times where I wished they had wiped the tables and/or swept but the eating area is usually pretty tidy.  

Menu - 6.5/10: Beef Villa specializes in your usual Chicago &#34;beef stand&#34; fare.  The difference is they differentiate themselves by offering broasted chicken in addition to the standard dog, beef, polish, gyro options.  They also try specialty sandwiches and salads at times along with certain seasonal items.

Service - 7/10: the service is usually friendly and accommodating.  The thing that sets them apart is the speed in which the orders are processed and the language used to communicate the orders from the counter to the kitchen.  Even though orders are never written down there is rarely an error with the orders, which in a fast food environment is impressive.

Food - 7/10: While the beefs are above average and generous when compared to other beef joints throughout the &#39;burbs, they never get the beef wet enough for my liking and charge for a side of juice.   The dogs are Red Hot Chicago, which I prefer, and have all the toppings you have come to expect on a Chicago dog.  The only complaint with the dogs is that there are times when the buns are either hard or over steamed.  The sides are average although they have combinations that are unique such as &#34;more cheese&#34;.  The exception to the run of the mill sides that you get everywhere is the cheese fries.  Served in movie theatre sized popcorn cups and absolutely loaded with liquid gold, they are served with forks which quickly become a necessity to truly enjoy this cheesy achievement.  Another menu item that is unique to Beef Villa, which differentiates them from other dog and beef stands, is their broasted chicken.  The Beef Villa broasted chicken has been a staple with our family/friends for parties and gatherings for years.  Even more impressive is they offer a three piece meal for a bargain price on Tuesday nights.  Prices vary, some items are reasonable, others in line with market, while others are very high but they do offer nightly specials.    

Drinks - 4/10:  They offer the standard fountain drinks and machine shakes but little other options.

Overall Experience - 7/10:  This is the dog joint that I grew up on and will always be my basis for comparison of any future beefs and dogs.  They offer solid items across the board and always try to experiment with seasonal items.  I just wish that they would begin offering value meals and not have all items be ala carte."

If you pre-order it is always done on time and ready to be served when you get home. I try to find the coupon for the 16 piece and it is a money saver.

The cheese fries are just OK as it is similar to velveta. The broasted chicken is amazing and has been for years. The only thing I would recommend not to EVER order is the Hot Dogs. They do not use Vienna Beef Hot Dogs which is what all perfect Hot Dog places serve. They serve Red Hot Chicago dogs which are &#34;Chicago Style&#34; and not authentic Chicago Hot Dogs."

Tonkatsu Ramen: pork was a little hard, good portion of veggies, broth is probably from a ramen package. 6/10 scale 
Spider roll: favorite of the night! Good portion and fresh. 9/10 scale

Surely if you get the fancier rolls you&#39;d be happy but the regular old maki is just alright.  I tried the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and spicy yellowtail in their {cheap!} 3-roll lunch special and all were decent but nothing too exciting.  None of the rolls were overly flavorful or spicy, nor did they have anything but the typical mushier blend of fish, mayo, and spice, but none were BAD.  I would prefer to be able to say for sure which roll is which when I get three different kinds but they all tasted pretty similar.  The only way you could really tell the difference was by color.  Oh well.  Point is...if you are coming here for sushi go all out or get some add ons to the regular maki rolls to give them some punch.

We had a great time! There was two main people helping serve. Service was attentive, but not pushy. 

We ordered 3 sushi rolls, the Alaska Roll (salmon, avocado, cucumber), the NY roll (crab, more crab, avocado, spicy mayo, eel sauce, crunchy topping) and a chicken tempura roll. I was impressed with the prices off the bat. I&#39;m used to seeing rolls of this sort for at least $3-5 more!! Sold just on that. The actual rolls were hearty, delicious, fresh, and arrived with beautiful presentation.

It&#39;s BYOB, so no excuse to ever be disappointed in the drinks! ;)

It was a nice family establishment, clean (including the bathrooms), bright, and not trying to be anything but a quality food establishment. It wasn&#39;t a place of smoke and mirrors that was trying to be uber trendy, which was also appreciated.

The hot dishes/apps/meals that went by us to other tables were all SO appealing that we definitely want to come back to try many more things!"

The sushi here is pretty great. I&#39;ve been to Koi 5 or 6 times and never gotten a bad piece of fish or a dud entree.

It&#39;s not the best in the suburbs but it&#39;s very good.
There are some truly bad chinese places in the suburbs and Koi definitely is NOT one of them.

So, the food is good. They do a solid curry, a great Thai basil, and all of the staples are solid. You can tell that they are more Japanese-based when you order an egg roll and instead of the mini burrito that most places serve you get tiny little egg rolls in a fantastic, crispy shell. 

The big thing I like about Koi is that the owner and cook seem to really take pride in their work. I&#39;ve gotten take out and dined in several times and every time have gotten great service."

Don&#39;t drive too fast on Gary Avenue, just south of the intersection with Geneva Road. There have been multiple failed establishments at this location (which I never tried), but hopefully this one sticks around.

They are located in a very small strip mall with a dog grooming business. The restaurant is not too big, but I was surprised how far the building went to the back; they could fit multiple big parties if need be.

Anyways, we were greeted and seated promptly. Of course, sushi is a big part of the menu, but they have other Thai and Chinese dishes as well.

My mom and I opted for their lunch specials. She ordered the Salmon Teriyaki Bento Box for $9.00 dollars. It came with the glazed salmon, white rice, house salad, miso soup, and two California rolls.

I went with the Chinese Chicken and Broccoli lunch special, which was served with white rice and miso soup. I added a house salad for an additional $2.00 dollar charge (Lunch special was $6.45).

My chicken and broccoli was cooked in a sweet brown sauce with carrots. It was very good. The miso soup was my favorite part of my meal. It had seaweed, tofu, and scallions. So tasty! Best miso I&#39;ve had at an Asian restaurant. My house salad featured lettuce, tomato, and cucumbers. The salad itself was nothing special but the ginger dressing (no doubt homemade) was excellent.

My mom offered me her sautéed onions (which were under her salmon) and those were superb as well. She didn&#39;t eat the white rice (I ate mine; hard to mess up white rice but I&#39;ll say it was great). She agreed with me that the dressing was awesome, too.

Most importantly, I took a big step in my life today. I, at age 26, had my first (and second) sushi roll! The California roll was awesome; white rice around seaweed, cucumber, avocado, and crab meat. I don&#39;t really do seafood but this place may have turned the tides for me! I eat shrimp on occasion but this was like Neil Armstrong&#39;s giant leap for mankind.

I would highly recommend coming here for a nice quiet lunch or dinner. I thoroughly enjoyed my expereicne and have nothing negative to note. GO TO KOI&#39;S!"

Safe to say that I hope this restaurant actually sticks around.

For those not familiar with this particular spot, it has been the location of an American grill named after a certain wizard from Lord of the Rings, and a short-lived Vietnamese restaurant. In an attempt to compensate for the fact that no one lives within walking distance of here, Koi Sushi &amp; Grill serves a variety of Chinese, Japanese and Thai dishes, thus fully earning the &#34;Asian Fusion&#34; category label.

I kicked things off with a couple of appetizers; gyoza (pan-fried dumplings) and the ringer, agedashi tofu. The gyoza was good (I should have gotten two orders of 6 each) and on the smallish side. The tofu was everything I hoped it would be; somewhat firm but hot, so kind of melty, with a crispy panko coating on the outside, served with some sort of a sweet fish sauce. This also came in a group of six, and I ate three, because the whiter members of my family don&#39;t have an appreciation for tofu. 

But I digress. The main keeper for me was the Crunchy 2 in 1, which is a terrible name for an awesome signature roll. Basically, take salmon, shallow fry it in panko, wrap it with avocado and crab meat, and put more crunchy things on top. (I guess I can&#39;t think of a better name for it either.) The fish was fresh, and I was sold from there on out.

I had bits and pieces of sesame chicken, which was quite crunchy and very good.

So look. This place is still easy to drive by, but from what I had, it&#39;s a great place to have an Asian-inspired meal. At $70 (tip included!) for 6 people, it&#39;s criminally cheap, too."

We came early, no one was there at 6pm, but by 7pm on a Sunday most of the tables were filled (30% off ALL sushi Sunday!) and there were 3 people waiting for their to go orders. The place is nice inside despite it&#39;s meager exterior, clean and simple decor. Not a lot of seating but guessing most of the customers do carryout anyway. 

The sushi was good, above average, weighted more toward the spicy side for their signature rolls, of which there are many similarities between several signature rolls. We had the fujiyama (hubby liked, I thought it was just OK), the NY roll (very good), Philly (very good), Golden Dragon (excellent), California Roll (son enjoyed). Everything was beautifully plated - my sister said Gordon Ramsey would compliment them on presentation! As for the entrees - I heard the Lo Mein was very good, and the broccoli beef was fine (but this is coming from a super picky eater). The side of veggie fried rice was a little burnt and arrived at the table quite a bit after the entree it was to be eaten with was served. The chicken fried rice was good, a little soft for fried rice but thankfully not salty. But see below - there was probably a good reason for some of the entrees not being up to standards. 

Our server/cook was the owner, who was super generous, extremely hardworking, and eager to please. He was very apologetic when he made a chicken broccoli instead of the beef. We felt bad because his cook went home sick and he was also down the only server/bus boy in the place. Glad the sushi chef was well! So the owner had to do everything, and in rushing, one of the entree orders was screwed up and the entrees took a while since he was the only one doing the cooking, so one half of the table just started to eat while the rest of us who ordered sushi were almost done. He let us keep the chicken entree and didn&#39;t charge us for dessert. Because he was so busy, we ate our dessert while the used dinner plates were still on the table, which under any other circumstances I would not be a huge fan.  We also had to get up and find our own &#34;to go&#34; containers, and some members were a little put off when a can of Coke was placed on the table, instead of it being served fountain style. If you don&#39;t mind a little &#39;self-service&#39; on occasion, which generally was not a huge problem for us, then it&#39;s fine.

If we lived closer or happened to be out and about, we might try this place again, for now our routine carryout sushi place is just as good and same in price. We like the owner a lot and hope this place does well for him, and hope he gets consistent or back up staff to help him out. I recommend you try it out for yourself, hopefully half the staff won&#39;t be out that day...!"

We wanted a small sample of the sushi fare and ordered:
Miso soup
House salad with ginger dressing
Avocado roll
Philadelphia roll
Eel Avocado roll

(Yes, we love avocado!)

Miso soup tasted watered down--definitely don&#39;t recommend it. House salad was good, not great, but worth ordering if it doesn&#39;t already come with your meal and you want your typical ginger dressing.

The avocado roll and Philadelphia roll were truly delicious, melt-in-your-mouth sushi--which is exactly what we had been hoping for. The chunks in the sushi were large and you could definitely taste all the flavors. 

The Eel avocado roll was pretty disappointing though. Even more so because I LOVE eel! The flavor was non-existent, even though the piece was large and it came topped with eel sauce. Bummer. So much for the super amazing sushi...

So overall, the food was just ok. I feel like it was pretty hit-or-miss... especially for the price. Their basic rolls were an average of $6. For that much per roll, I&#39;d expect consistency on the basics.

We did think it was good enough to come back for the specials though. 30% off rolls on Sundays, and their Lunch Specials had more selection than most for the sushi: $11 for 3 rolls of your choice from a list of about 10-12. (Most places pre-pick the 3 for you and usually always include a California roll.)

No real thoughts on the service. We were pretty much the only ones there and the server was attentive. Can&#39;t ask for much on a dead weekday I suppose."

- Prices were reasonable.

The waitress was very friendly and took care of us right away. We ordered a japanese soda which was ok but the bottle was very cool. I started out my meal with a cucumber salad that was fantastic. The cucumber was shredded and it was crisp and the dressing was just delicious. I devoured it and thouroughly enjoyed it. My boyfriend ordered the house salad with ginger dressing and it was a nice portion. We ordered a few rolls and they were all quite delicious. Our favorite was the Dragon roll. 
We enjoyed our sushi night, everything was delicious, the prices were good and the cleanliness and great service made for a wonderful experience. We will be back. We are dying to try what a guy a few tables over ordered, the teriyaki steak dish. It smelled amazing!"

The owner here is great, obviously takes a lot of pride in his restaurant, he came and spoke with us before we ordered. The remainder of the service was great as well. We both had sushi and it was good, although equal to what I&#39;ve had at other places. The presentation was great. We ordered one roll that was done in cucumber and it was very difficult to grab with chopsticks, but still tasty. It is BYOB and they don&#39;t charge a corkage fee to open your wine. NICE TOUCH!

We also had the crab rangoon ($4 for 3 large pieces) (4 stars) and some miso soup ($2) (4 stars). The special rolls were the best part of the meal, and the service was 5 stars.

Had the crab Rangoon again. Waitress mentioned that they&#39;re made in batches and frozen, and we could tell. Definitely the low point of the meal.

I had Mongolian chicken and the crab Rangoon. Both were well seasoned and very good. They packaged all the food items separately, instead of putting everything in one box. I do not car for sushi, but there was a small but nice sushi bar with the chef waiting behind it to make everything fresh.
You can tell the owner takes pride in his food as everything seems to be fresh and hot. 
It is a small place so you can miss it easily, but I  would recommend stopping in because in my opinion it is one of the better places in the area."

I agree with other Yelpers location is a little odd and decor nothing fancy. But the food and service were great. The owner came by often.. We were the only ones there at odd time right before the Bears game was over. Had no idea rolls were 30% off on Sunday until we got the bill.  Yellowtail jalapeño appetizer was fresh and beautifully presented with seaweed on top. We also had house salad for only $2.. Been to many places where they charge much more. Ginger dressing great. Only needed two rolls the volcano was huge warm and tasty . Mexican roll was good too. Wish we lived closer. Would be back often.

Our favorites include the KOI special roll, NY roll and  the Golden dragon which was outstanding, as well as the classic spicy tuna which is one of my favorites here. Nigiri sushi contains generous portions of fish and outstanding flavor and quality. Oh I cant leave out the amazing appetizers such as Tuna jalapeno and Spicy tuna bowl- they are AMAZING.

1. Soup
2. Maki roll
3. Lunch entree

Look, I can put away some food, and even I couldn&#39;t finish my meal. The miso soup was excellent; the spider roll maki I had with my meal had EXCELLENT texture--lettuce and cucumber gave it an extra bit of crunch, and it was a generous sized roll; the sesame chicken I had as my entree was HUGE and also very good. My partner had the hot braised chicken, which he liked--it was a lot like an orange chicken (very citrus-y). 

We came for lunch on a Thursday and were seated immediately; for busier times you&#39;d probably want to make a reservation. 

I&#39;m looking forward to coming back for dinner and doing a thorough assessment of their sushi selection. And also for their prix-fixe lunch. And also to try more of their entrees. OK, look, I&#39;m just going to come back a lot. 

(Also, I hope they don&#39;t ONLY deliver in Evanston, because I&#39;ve been looking for a good Chinese delivery place and if I could get Koi to my far north Chicago apartment I&#39;m pretty sure my take-out/delivery menu collection would be complete...)"

This place is only 3 weeks old (as of 1/31) and not to be confused with the previous establishment of the same address that closed down some time ago. 

Chris (manager?) and Jason (Sushi chef) were very polite and the food was beautiful and delicious. They take great pride in their work, and offered to make both on and off-menu Chinese and Thai selections if desired (and available).  

We had three sushi rolls (spicy yellowtail, 2x tempura) as a light dinner and they threw in a house specialty salad concoction for free. The salad was unusual, long, thinly sliced, crunchy veggies, plus thinly sliced red snapper and some sort of yellow sauce. Everything was absolutely delicious. 

Service was excellent, and the tiny location was very non-threatening. No need to dress up, but they are very professional and happy to serve. Sometimes you can tell when restauranteurs truly appreciate their customers - these guys do.
 
We will definitely go back, and highly recommend for excellent, reasonable, casual Japanese / Sushi."

The sushi was not fresh and the hot dishes were drowning in sauce but lacking in flavor. Also, overpriced for quality and portion size.

Great lunch specials with a lot to choose from that are reasonably priced. We&#39;ve done carry out and dine in. Lunch specials are 6 piece rolls instead of the standard 4 pieces and come with miso soup AND salad. Everything I&#39;ve tried I&#39;ve liked. Please give it a try.

Time of my visit: Dinner

I have been coming to this place for a while now.  This is by far my favorite shawarma joint!  Today did not disappoint either!

Today, I order shawarma with fries and a drink, as well as an Israeli (it might be called something else now) salad.  Let me start with shawarma, it was excellent, the meat was perfectly cooked, moist and soft chicken!  I took it in the pita.  Usually they put Israeli salad inside as well.  It was a perfect ratio of meat to salad!

The fries looked like home made chips, which I personally prefer!  And they actually made it home with me without getting too saggy.  Delicious!

The Israeli salad was actually a nice size for a side salad and had plenty of different veggies in it!  Definitely worth the money!

Overall an A+ experience!

Side note: I know this is a chain and normally I don&#39;t like to review chains, but this chain is limited to a small geographical area and each restaurant prepares things uniquely, at least in my experience."

It came with a side of &#34;fries&#34;, which are more like chips, but were quite soggy. Also, after ordering, I was told it would take 10-15 minutes to get my food.

It has a similar concept to Chipotle.  You choose to start with either a pita, rice bowl, or salad bowl then choose your meat (chicken shawarma, steak shawarma, or falafel), garnishes (chopped salad, purple cabbage salad, sumac onions, and/or pickles), and sauces (tahini, garlic, amba, s&#39;khug, and/or harissa).  

I tried their salad bowl with chicken shawarma.  I really love the flavor of the chicken.  It was fresh, tender, and juicy.  The crunch of the salad was a great accompany to the meat.  If that was enough, the side a pita they provided was heavenly.  It was soft, warm, and had a nice chew.  The portion sizes here are very generous, so come with a hungry tummy.

During lunch time, the lines can be a little long.  But don&#39;t fret, it seems to go by fast.  The staff here are extremely efficient and friendly.  I can&#39;t wait until my next visit."

I crave the Chicken Shawarma (also love the Beef Tenderloin) Five stars just for this. My wife and I are hooked.

The fries are good, The Falafel is sometimes outstanding and sometimes just good, lentil soup is excellent and the Baba Ganoush is babaganoushy. I have a high tolerance for heat, so I don&#39;t find their hot sauces all that spicy, just really tasty! 

Prices are reasonable, right around $20 for two meals. If you want Tahini sauce and it isn&#39;t on your tray.. just ask. 

Bright and lively atmosphere. The place get&#39;s packed at lunchtime.. we find that if we get there 20 minutes before noon the lines aren&#39;t bad, otherwise we shoot for closer to 1.

I decided to check out the restaurant with her and let my taste buds have some adventure.  The ambiance is casual and comfortable.  It&#39;s not so loud so carrying a conversation is easy.  

I have had the Kefta Pita which is a freshly made pita stuffed with very well seasoned ground meat, hummus, chopped salad, and sumac onions.  The combination is very delicious, but messy as the garlic sauce drips.  Be prepared to wipe your hands periodically.  I received one side dish and decided to get the Naf Fries.  This was awesome.  It&#39;s even better with the Tahini Sauce.

The cashiers are all very pleasant to talk to and very patient when I asked them what is good.  I have been advised that questions such as, &#34;What do you like to eat here, or what is good here?&#34; are all very annoying questions.  So, when I asked those questions to them, they were prepared with an answer and how they answered was in a friendly tone.  I&#39;m impressed by their willingness to entertain my questions.

I ordered the chicken schwarma plate (add a couple falafel) and he ordered the falafel pita. The prices were a little higher than I remembered, however I went home with a huge amount of leftovers for the next day. The plate will run about $12 depending on which one you pick. The plate comes with your choice of protein, rice, cucumber/tomato salad and a pita. There are also a few sauce choices that are left out so you can pick and choose. My favorite was the green. It had a little bit of a kick but the cucumber salad cooled my mouth down. 

The food is fresh so it&#39;ll take a few minutes for it to cook. Ours took about 15 minutes. You&#39;ll get a beeper and they&#39;ll buzz you when it&#39;s ready. 

The dining room is pretty big and I imagine it gets pretty packed here during peak times. There were quite a few people here, but still lots of places to sit.

Hummus-fresh, but a little on the bland side.

Lentil soup was tasty. It added a little hot sauce and pickle juice for flavor. 

Vegetarian platter was filling and generous with falafel , hummus, cabbage, babganoush and tahini.  All good things that can be even individually or stuffed into very fresh pitas that come with the meal.

NafNaf is to middle eastern food what Chipotle is to Mexican food. 
It&#39;s a healthy alternative to fast food for sure.  It&#39;s good quality and everything on the menu is safe for just about any person&#39;s tastes.  Just don&#39;t get too excited about this being any sort of authentic experience, it&#39;s not.... 
Somewhere like Pita Paradise in Carol Stream is much more authentic and the dishes will all have better depth to them while staying in the same price range. 
But, if you&#39;re an average suburbanite looking for something different for lunch, or if you&#39;re looking for something &#34;ethnic but not too ethnic &#34; then NafNaf is great.

I&#39;ve had good experiences with the chicken kabobs and shwarma as well as the beff kabobs and steak kabobs.  I feel like the pitas are a much better value for your money than the entrée plates. The pita bread here is pretty great."

I know Naf Naf&#39;ers would toss me out if they heard me say that, but it&#39;s true. You can branch out from the shawarma and order other things, people. And first on the list should be the beef tenderloin. --You can cut the steak with a plastic fork. And what to order with a plate of dead cow? It only makes sense to order the vegetarian feast. ;) --Purple Cabbage, Hummus, Tabule, Baba Ghanoush (tahini, eggplant, lemon, garlic, and olive oil) and 4 Falafels. I can&#39;t eat it all and I never reheat steak or falafel. It&#39;s terribly wasteful I know, but the combinations are just so good together, I just don&#39;t care.
 
Not much of a wait here. Even when it&#39;s busy it comes out fairly quick. Not immediate, but not long. 5-7 minutes. Not even on a Fri night do you wait much.

Check.  Lentil soup, which is probably one of the healthiest (disregard sodium) and tastiest soups you can get anywhere.  Check.

Its like a fast food restaurant but better food &amp; more healthy :)  (maybe healthy lol)

It can get busy but not much of a wait time.  We been there several times, even when its busy, food comes out fairly quick.  

Option of food, not much to pick from, chicken, steak, potatoes/fired food....

Food:
Pita is fresh! But on the thicker side I guess I should complaint...?!?!
Lentil soup is delicious highly recommended!!
chicken shawarma is delicious!
Potatoes chips are super super super good!!!

I know Naf Naf&#39;ers would toss me out if they heard me say that, but it&#39;s true. You can branch out from the shawarma and order other things, people. And first on the list should be the beef tenderloin. --You can cut the steak with a plastic fork. And what to order with a plate of dead cow? It only makes sense to order the vegetarian feast. ;) --Purple Cabbage, Hummus, Tabule, Baba Ghanoush (tahini, eggplant, lemon, garlic, and olive oil) and 4 Falafels. I can&#39;t eat it all and I never reheat steak or falafel. It&#39;s terribly wasteful I know, but the combinations are just so good together, I just don&#39;t care.
 
Not much of a wait here. Even when it&#39;s busy it comes out fairly quick. Not immediate, but not long. 5-7 minutes. Not even on a Fri night do you wait much. And if you&#39;re like me and boycott the Valentine&#39;s Day Prix Fixe whilst sitting elbow to elbow with overly perfumed strangers, you can make Naf Naf your tradition as I have.

I ordered chicken schwarma which was a giant portion (at least 1/2lb of meat) - it was nicely spiced and not oily. My meal came with 2 sides so I picked salad (fresh and tasty) and rice (again, a giant amount). I didn&#39;t realize how much food I&#39;d be getting so I ordered a cup of lentil soup which was way too salty, so not much got eaten. In addition to all of the above, they sent me home with two big pieces of pita too. I&#39;m in the minority in not really liking Naf Naf&#39;s pita - it&#39;s too doughy for me, but it&#39;s certainly better than the bagged stuff.

The employees here were fast and pleasant - can&#39;t ask for more than that.

All perfect words to sum up this jem of a spot! I was here on a weekend vacation and stayed with local family and we came here for my last dinner before departing and oh my goodness it was so so spectacular! My uncle ordered the falafel on the plate, I got the beef tenderloin on a plate, and my aunt got the Israeli salad with a side of hummus. All meals come with your choice of two sides (hummus, fries, Israeli salad), yummy garlicky tahini, and a basket of warm, delicious, soft squishy made-fresh-on-site pita. I was blown away. I think of myself as a Mediterranean connoisseur and I&#39;ve never had squishy fluffy pita. I&#39;ve always had the flattened kind that&#39;s unleavened but this was. Ah. May. Zing. 

Green spicy sauce for the taking along with homemade pickles. They look like typical dill pickles but they&#39;re not. They&#39;re a nice salty palate cleanser. So good. 

Would love if this small chain would explode and open branches to replace every single Taco Bell and McDonald&#39;s in the U.S. but yknow, life can&#39;t make that much sense right? Ha! 

Two entrees, side of hummus, and main size Israeli salad with side fixins- Our meal was $30 with one medium drink. I even asked for taboule salad AND Israeli salad instead of hummus or fries (trying to stay away from carbs... Except that damn tasty pita!!!) and they happily made the exchange! No problem!

Service has always been very friendly and the menu options they have are delicious, though selection is pretty limited (but hey, so is Chipotle!). The veggie platter is reasonably priced, filling, and beyond tasty so you&#39;ll have a hard time choosing between the hummus and the baba ghanoush to put on your pitas.

Every time I drive by it I just have to look at it at the very least.  I imagine the people inside as they&#39;re cramming deliciousness into their faces.  That&#39;s the kind of place this is.  I&#39;m so serious.  

But when I have the opportunity to stop in here&#39;s how it goes down.  I&#39;m going to try to keep this brief because I could go on and on.  So.  For those of you that haven&#39;t been here this is the deal: 

1. Enter the establishment.  
2. Get excited but try not to look like a spaz.  
3. In a calm and collected fashion order the chicken shawarma, chopped salad, and basmati rice.  And some hummus.  
4. Find a place to sit down and enhance your calm.  
5. When the food is ready, smile and thank them.
6. Now eat.  
7. Savor it.  
8. Taste it.  
9. Let it become a part of you.  
10. Try not to freak out from the insanity.  
11. Write a yelp review.  
12. Then come back and thank me.  

That&#39;s all I ask.  Go.  I beg of you."

Years ago it was located in a tiny space within walking distance from where I live, and years into the future, it is still as tasty and delicious as ever! While I was working in New York over the summer I craved 2 things (1) Jimmy John&#39;s (2) Naf Naf

I don&#39;t usually eat vegetarian, but for EVERYONE I highly suggest getting the Falafel pita (or Veggie pita...it use to be on their old menu) at least ONCE. The few times that I have gotten the chicken breast pita or beef kabob pita, it is always juicy, seasoned and grilled perfectly.

I have never gotten anything else but a pita here, but trust me when I tell you I have eaten here at least once a week (no joke) for the past 6 months (not exaggerating), and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ever going to get sick of the food :)

What are you waiting for? Go get Naf Naf!"

My favorite was the shawarma pita, and the kebab pita. OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. 
The pitas are made in-house, making them light and fluffy. Hummus is great. So are the falafel. If I lived closer I would eat here once a week."

All perfect words to sum up this jem of a spot! I was here on a weekend vacation and stayed with local family and we came here for my last dinner before departing and oh my goodness it was so so spectacular! My uncle ordered the falafel on the plate, I got the beef tenderloin on a plate, and my aunt got the Israeli salad with a side of hummus. All meals come with your choice of two sides (hummus, fries, Israeli salad), yummy garlicky tahini, and a basket of warm, delicious, soft squishy made-fresh-on-site pita. I was blown away. I think of myself as a Mediterranean connoisseur and I&#39;ve never had squishy fluffy pita. I&#39;ve always had the flattened kind that&#39;s unleavened but this was. Ah. May. Zing. 

Green spicy sauce for the taking along with homemade pickles. They look like typical dill pickles but they&#39;re not. They&#39;re a nice salty palate cleanser. So good. 

Would love if this small chain would explode and open branches to replace every single Taco Bell and McDonald&#39;s in the U.S. but yknow, life can&#39;t make that much sense right? Ha! 

Two entrees, side of hummus, and main size Israeli salad with side fixins- Our meal was $30 with one medium drink. I even asked for taboule salad AND Israeli salad instead of hummus or fries (trying to stay away from carbs... Except that damn tasty pita!!!) and they happily made the exchange! No problem! 

Naf Naf you are fab fab."

I&#39;m 100% serious, and I&#39;m rooting for its success. My family and I have been noshing on Naf Naf for the past few years, and we&#39;re all obsessed. Mind you - this is a family with three vegetarians (read: not picky, but need good veggie options). Luckily, Naf Naf delivers.

Service has always been very friendly and the menu options they have are delicious, though selection is pretty limited (but hey, so is Chipotle!). The veggie platter is reasonably priced, filling, and beyond tasty so you&#39;ll have a hard time choosing between the hummus and the baba ghanoush to put on your pitas. Speaking of which, are wonderful beyond words... to paraphrase another reviewer &#34;PITA LIKE PILLOWS.&#34; Trust me, they are hands down the best pitas you will ever have. Ever.

Then. Enter family med rotation. And a drug rep. Well, many of them. And they were all bringing Naf Naf. Oh heaven.. yep. I said it.

The chicken, steak, falafel. It&#39;s all delicious. All fresh, and all perfectly seasoned. The pitas are fantastic. The cucumber salad is light and refreshing.

I have no idea what it costs (thanks to free lunch), nor what the store looks like (because it was always delivered). All I know is that it is delicious and I am so glad I just had it like 10 times in 6 weeks. It&#39;s that good."

Having traveled across the U.S. extensively for the last decade, I have learned that the same cannot be said for anywhere else here.  I was usually disappointed by even more expensive establishments.  As a matter of fact, I could frequently be heard as saying, &#34;this Baba Ghanoush tastes like slug slime!&#34; And &#34;Who puts potatoes in tabbouleh?!&#34;.

You can imagine my surprise when I stepped into Naf Naf grill with low expectations, and ended up having one of the best falafel sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had, and great hummus to boot.  I was wary of the meat (because I thought Naf Naf was a big fast-casual chain, and I&#39;m weird like that) but after this experience, Yelp reviews, and reading the story of their small, local beginnings, I have no doubt the meat is fresh and delicious too.

Being a vegetarian stinks at times, but Naf Naf grill I may never tired of. Their falafel and pita bread are the best around. I can honestly say no other place compares. The falafel is always fresh and the perfect texture. The pita bread is like little clouds of heaven. The pita bread is so fluffy and soft, I&#39;d gladly make myself a life size pita blanket :) The garlic sauce is so good. I&#39;m not sure what they mixed together to make it, but I dip everything in it when I&#39;m there.

My big irritation though is their fries. Before I proceed, they are not fries, they are like chips. Simply put, they are soggy chips. It&#39;s like they dipped them in warm oil, dried them a little and threw them together. My way around this is to ask for them extra crispy. Once they get the extra crispy memo they are perfect though! 

What&#39;s even better, is my husband and I can split the falafel pita meal and both eat for less than $9."

I wish this location would let you choose what you want inside your pita. What you read on the menu is what you are served. Pickles and hot sauce are offered on the side, you will need to grab these items when you grab your order.

It was packed!  And for good reason it seems, as the food was fantastic, and there was almost no wait.  The food was all very flavorful and bold.  Often times it seems that chain restaurants just barely season everything and the food is bland, but not the case here!  I will be back, and often!  It is also pretty reasonably priced for the quality and freshness of the food.  Awesome!"

I always get the same thing: chicken shwarma on a plate with double Israeli salad, and a balklava. The chicken shwarma is this absurdly flavorful spit-roasted chicken that is always moist and tender, cut into strips. Then you get pitas which are warm, pillowy perfection, AND tahini, AND this weird hot pepper mix that I don&#39;t dare eat, AND the Israeli salad which is a cucumber-y delight! My mom loves their fries (which are potato chips. Right?! Why are these called fries?) but I can&#39;t get past that unusual and delicious salad. 

The baklava is packaged and ready to go at the counter, but tastes fresh every time, and is an incredible sweet ending to a delicious meal. Also, it looks really hard to make and like something I couldn&#39;t possibly recreate, so props to them.

The food is so fast and even with a drink, is in the $10-$12 standard lunch fare in the area range. I never eat there because they desperately need more space and the place is horrifically claustrophobic, but I generally like going to these types of places for &#34;to-go&#34; orders, anyway.

The babaganoush and chicken shawarma had just the right amount of seasoning. The falafel and pita bread was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Both were so soft and tasty. The hot and tahini sauces were both great too. I love Mediterranean food and this was some of the best, especially considering the price and speed.

SERVICE: 5 stars - This is an order/pay and get your food at the counter type of place. They get 5 stars for service because they seemed to be very efficient even though it was extremely busy. They also give a buzzer so you know when your food is ready at the counter thus helping lessen confusion. 

ENVIRONMENT: 4 stars - The acoustics and space could use so work but a loud, packed place is somewhat expected for such a busy, fast paced place."

The surroundings were pleasant if somewhat bland, both on the outside (strip mall) and inside (aside from some amusing signage, kind of like a Noodles &amp; Company).  The food was what shone though.  Meat dishes were juicy and seasoned just right.  My wife enjoyed the schwarma and the kids liked the chicken thigh pitas.  I went purely vegetarian, and all in our group had hummus and pitas.  Everything tasted fresh and flavorful, and portion sizes were generous.  The available desserts, like baklava, were a nice conclusion to the meal.  Prices were reasonable for quick-service, and the staff was friendly.

I know - not an epic review - but much like Naf Naf it gets the job done without a lot of fireworks."

I had the chicken shawarma plate, and it was flavorful, and the rice and chips were good too.  

My friends got a pita (pretty good size) and the veggie feast and they were happy with their food too.  Both of the stars in this review are for the food, because the rest of the experience was not so great.

For starters, the restauarant is crowded and noisy as can be.  I guess this could be seen as the spoils of victory, as this is a popular lunch spot.  

But the deal breaker was that it took forever to get the food.  We did not ask for anything special and it took almost 20 minutes to put our order together.  During this time we watched as the dine-in customers that came in after us got the exact same items that we ordered served to them in less than 5 minutes.  

We were frustrated by this, and it is enough to keep us from returning.  They probably will not miss the business though, because they have plenty of customers and can afford to alienate a few..."

The service was very slow, and the restaurant itself was a bit &#34;skeezy&#34; looking.

I visited this place for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon, after getting my kid&#39;s haircut down the street at KidSnips.  Yelp, you did right by me once again.  We ordered the hummus and pita to start, and while the hummus was pretty standard, the pita was soooo good, not that store-bought crap.  The tandoori burger was massive and had a deliciously spicy sauce on it.  Moist, juicy, and healthy!  But the star of the show had to be the spicy chicken wrap.  Tender morsels of tandoori chicken in a spicy sauce with onions.  Sounds simple enough, but the best way to describe it was &#34;orgasmic.&#34;  Oh and the kiddo loved the fresh-cut fries dipped in the garlic sauce.

The food is generally ready after a short wait and the service has improved from years ago when they first opened.

Our first taste was at the Streamwood location, and husband and I both got plates.....one beef shawarma and one kifta. Both were delish, and came with flavorful sides (rice and humus, although you could have chosen others), and a pita. I do have to say that I&#39;m still partial to my other kabob-wielding-pita-baking location, as they are fluffier and more pillow like, but the pitas are delish nonetheless :) I do also appreciate that they have kids meals, which are honestly HUGE!

I normally read critiques instead of writing them but I was so pleased with Pita BBQ I had to write. We moved from Chicago to Streamwood six months ago and fell into a food void where we survived on Mariano&#39;s carry out steaks. Friends told us about Pita BBQ&#39;s lunch special. So having a day off of work, I had to try it not expecting more than a bland mix of meat, hummus, and yellow rice; I was overwhelmingly pleased with the flavors of the meat,freshness of the hummus and basmati rice. When I told the owner that I was having trouble fining good food in Streamwood, he gave me a sample of his Spicy Chili Chicken. It was amazing. The chicken was fresh and flavorful on top of basmati rice which blended well with the chicken. I almost forgot they had home made pita bread. I can&#39;t wait to try some of their other dishes.

There were just a few things that didn&#39;t fit to par with a 4 star review. So, in all fairness 3 for now. 

I grew up in Montreal and am used some pretty yummy Mediterranean food. (big juicy not over cooked shawarma, tasty salad with a house dressing, garlic potatoes, tasty rice pilaf style and a delicious thick and fluffy garlic sauce. The hunt for a replica of this sauce continues!)

After reading the reviews I was really optimistic, but Pita House BBQ fell a bit short of my expectations. 

I ordered the chicken shawarma plate, which was tasty but the chicken was over cooked. We ordered lentil soup because my daughter loves it, but unfortunately it&#39;s only sold seasonally. We ordered her some falafel and fries instead, but they didn&#39;t have fries... We got the falafel, but they were burnt to a crisp on the outside. :( We would have asked for another order but we overheard them complaining about a problem with the oil, so we didn&#39;t bother.

Our toddler happily ate the inside of the falafel and had some rice, but they ran out of spoons, so she had to make do with a plastic fork. She can use forks at home but the plastic disposable kind tend to be on the sharper/pointier side so we had to keep an extra eye out on her.

They did give us a complimentary chocolate covered baklava. Which was a pleasant surprise and it was quite good. The food was overall pretty tasty and the rice and chicken mixed with their garlic and hot sauce was really, really good! The workers were very friendly and apologetic about the lacking spoons. It was just a bad night. 

Looking forward to my next visit and my next review."

Today I had a lunch special for with 2 meats and 2 sides.  I showed the spicy chili chicken and beef shawarma with hummus and a Lebanese salad.  Of course I had to get a side of the falafel. 
All of it was great including the homemade pita which are made fresh throughout the day.  I highly recommend giving it a try if you are in the area.  I here there is another in South Elgin on Randall Road."

The Chicken shawrma today was not good. It had a bad taste to it and the Chicken had a rubbery texture"

I ended up here grabbing a quick lunch last week and was surprised they did away with the lunch special menu. So they don&#39;t have the super delux lunch for 6.95. I still ended up selecting the combo grill which had a little of everything. For 12 dollars it is slightly over priced for lunch. I am perplexed why the chicken kabobs came as slices of chicken and some of the shwarma was slightly overcooked and chewy. I think I will have to look elsewhere for Mediterranean food as the quality is slightly down from before. I guess all good things come to an end..."

We ordered the-
Chili chicken
Combination plate 
Both with rice and cabbage slaw
Spicy fries 


All was fantastic. I easily got three meals out of my combination plate.  The chicken chili plate wasn&#39;t spicy at all though. Spicy fries however, had a great spice to them. 

My only complaint is that the employees were not well versed in what was gluten free or not.  Saying &#39; well I don&#39;t know if it is gluten free&#39; 

Having eaten shawarma before, I felt like that was a safe bet. I didn&#39;t get a celiac attack, so I was safe."

Our family was jonesing for some delicious food &amp; so we decided to give Pita BBQ a shot.  Now, for those, like me, who had visions of some sort of Middle Eastern/St. Louis BBQ pit hybrid, sorry to disappoint, but that is definitely not what this place is (I guess I&#39;ll have to just leave the BBQ falafel &amp; lamb brisket where they belong, in my dreams).  

Pita BBQ offers delicious Mediterranean fare such as shawarma, Lebanese salad, and falafel.  My hungrier half and I each got ours plate style.  He opted for the chicken shawarma with hummus &amp; basamati rice while I got the falafel with Lebanese salad and hummus.  Our little got the best of both worlds &amp; just helped himself to our plates.  2 entree plates &amp; a couple of fountain drinks set us back about $22, which isn&#39;t too shabby.

The Falafel Plate:  The falafel was delicious.  It was super crispy on the outside and creamy soft in the middle.  The flavor was great &amp; made even better with a little tahini &amp; red sauce.  The hummus was decent, nothing to write home about (but that didn&#39;t keep my son from devouring pretty much the whole thing along with the fluffiest pita I&#39;ve ever seen).  It was sprinkled with a little paprika(?) for good measure, which gave it an extra boost.  The Lebanese salad was delicious, super fresh and flavorful, sort of like a lightly pickled, citrusy tomato/cucumber parsley party in your mouth.  I had to fight my son over bites of this.  

The Chicken Shawarma Plate:  The chicken was perfectly cooked.  I was a little confused that it came cut up into bite sized pieces.  Personally I would have preferred nice hearty chunks, but chicken is chicken, right?  The basmati rice was super plain.  I wish that it had more seasoning, but if safron-ed yellow rice is your thing, then dive right in.  My hungrier half gobbled his plate up like it was his last meal, if that tells you anything about how everything tasted.

I&#39;m looking forward to trying out some other items on the menu.  Although there were only 2 other families in there when we dined, I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t take that as an indication of the quality of food.  While it&#39;s not the absolute best Mid-Eastern food I&#39;ve ever sunk my teeth into, Pita BBQ and I will most certainly meet again sooner rather than later."

Perhaps it was the fact that I have been starting work at 6:45 a.m. all week, battling a nasty bug since last Friday, and had just come from a hellish adventure in Mt. Prospect, but this experience was the terrible icing on an inedible cake.  I&#39;ve passed by here many times on the way to and from my father&#39;s house.  I&#39;ve never really had the urge to stop, but I felt ambitious and so Pita BBQ it was.

I walked in and it was empty.  Not a single other patron was to be found. I almost decided to turn around, and I probably should have. Granted I came around 4:30, and maybe it&#39;s more of a take out place than dine-in, but it felt strange. I decided to stick around, so I surveyed the  menu board for a few moments before deciding on the Chili Chicken wrap, which is spicy chicken that is sauteed in red chili and onions, and served on flat bread. I paid for my order, took and seat, and waited.

Looking around, the restaurant is a hodgepodge mix of seating. It seems as though they raided a bunch of &#34;end of season&#34; sales at Lowe&#39;s and Home Depot&#39;s outdoor furniture area. There were multiple styles of chairs at a single table, and there was even a large, plastic looking table that would be better suited outdoors than in. I&#39;m not quite sure what kind of theme they are going for, but there&#39;s an obvious clash of style in every corner of the establishment.  I also noticed the name of the previous establishment still painted above the door.  I guess it&#39;d be too much work for someone to scrape that off.

After about three minutes, my order was ready. I opened my wrap to discover an enormous amount of fragrant chicken and onions spilling out of the flat bread.  Excited, I took my first bite and was immediately surprised by how spicy it is.  I&#39;m no stranger to spicy food, but this stuff was insane. I couldn&#39;t managed one bite without following up with a huge swig of water.  
With every bite, I noticed more and more that this dish tasted identical to chicken vindaloo that I used to get at an Indian restaurant in Naperville.  Months ago, that wouldn&#39;t have been a bad thing but I can no longer appreciate that style of food, so needless to say this meal was a huge turnoff. Between the taste association and the over abundance of spice, I threw in the towel and wrapped up the 3/4ths of the wrap I hadn&#39;t touched. I will say that the quality of the chicken was excellent and the flat bread was pillow-y soft.

The service deserves a big fat 0.  I encountered two different employees during my visit, and neither one of them were friendly or welcoming.  The guy who took my order had a perma-frown on his face and the personality of a wet mop.  When I asked for a box or bag for the remainder of my food, the second employee I dealt with looked bored out of his mind and it took every ounce of strength to pass me a styrofoam container. As I turned to leave, I was polite and said &#34;thank you&#34; but didn&#39;t receive a response.  I think one of them may have said something but it was under his breath.

Maybe I came on an &#34;off&#34; day but I have no desire to return.  I was expecting more of a Mediterranean flavor, not Indian. Pita BBQ left a bad taste in my mouth, literally and figuratively."

Since this was the first time, I ordered a combo plate with chicken and beef swarma, chicken kabobs, falafal and a side of hummus and basmati rice. Although the meats were tender, they were bland and the hummus was even more bland. The falafal was almost on the burnt side. The upside?  The basmati rice was awesome, very fragrant and tasty. Will I come back again?  Only if I were with friends who wanted med food. I&#39;ll try the wrap next time and maybe will have better experience."

The Yelp photos of the food looked delicious and a gyro sounded like the perfect meal. When I pulled up, the first thing I noticed was that no customers were there. We even ordered our food and ate it on a table outside and no other customers dined here the entire time. Probably a bad sign.. I found the interior of the restaurant to be lacking in cleanliness -- everything looked and felt dirty and the gentleman taking our order kept touching his nose (thank goodness he was not the one preparing the food). I also had to use the bathroom while there, and it certainly wasn&#39;t the cleanest public restroom I&#39;ve ever seen.

Now on to the food: we shared a gyro wrap and the &#34;famous&#34; chicken tandoori burger. The gyro was the better choice between the two. It had a generous portion of meat and the tzatziki sauce was refreshing and delicious. The chicken tandoori burger was underwhelming. The flavor only vaguely resembled what is was supposed to and half of the burger went unfinished."

I am usually nod a fan of middle-eastern food, but this place completely knocked my socks off. When I walked in I was not expecting much, the decor was startling and the the restaurant dark and generally uninviting. The staff were friendly while I was ordering, and bantered with me while I chose what I wanted to eat, which was nice of them. I got my meal and sat down to eat with coworkers - and proceeded to have my mind completely blown! I have LITERALLY never had a more delicious piece of pita bread in my entire life. And I have eaten a lot of it! I feel like I would go back just for the bread.

I can&#39;t rave as hard about the rest of the meal, the Spicy Chili Chicken was amazing, but just slightly too dry to push the review up into 5 stars. The basmati rice was really good, but  didn&#39;t have that special something to push it into the extraordinary range. 

Despite that for a ~$10 meal I was well more than satisfied! I actually got up after my meal to personally thank the chef for the experience - he gave me a fist bump, which was pretty cool. 

I am hoping that when I went it was just an off day, and the food will be worthy of my second 5 star review!"

I was convinced that I was starving and started to drive northbound on Route 59 from Bartlett. I couldn&#39;t even think of something that sounded good until I thought of Pita House....wait, I know this review is for Pita BBQ but you&#39;ll understand why I mention this in a moment. See, I really should belong to a support group for people who love Pita House. I have realized that I have a problem...that&#39;s the first step right?

Anyhow, I was going to drive to Schaumburg when I realized that Pita BBQ was moments away and I&#39;d never tried it before. That was all about to change. I pulled in the parking lot and wandered inside. The owner greeted me warmly and finished helping the gentleman in line before me. Once it was my turn, I realized that this was very similar in style to my beloved PH. The owner talked me through the menu and I quickly decided to get a combination plate to go. (My hubby was very happy to split dinner with me!)

The wait wasn&#39;t too bad. I took the time to enjoy the clean space and the friendly staff. I was hoping to grab a carryout menu, but they were all out. 

Once I got our food home, I couldn&#39;t help but compare everything to PH. My hubby did the same. Here&#39;s what we decided...

Pita bread:  Pita BBQ wins. The pitas were fresh and served warm. Plus, the owner threw in an extra at no charge. 

Rice:  It&#39;s a draw. Pita BBQ has a fine rice which has a nice flavor and kept me coming back for more. PH has a different texture and style of grain. Both are yummy. 

Chicken:  Pita BBQ wins this one. There were two types of chicken in the combo. Both were seasoned really well and juicy!

Kefta Kabob (or something very similar):  PH takes this one. Pita BBQ had a long ground beef item that looked like Kefta kabob. I think they call it something else though. I didn&#39;t love the seasoning unfortunately. 

Hummus:  PH gets this one too. The owner was kind enough to swap salad for hummus. But, I didn&#39;t love it. I didn&#39;t eat more than a couple bites before I decided to skip it. :-( I was disappointed. 

So, in summary, Pita BBQ has some really tasty options and I am happy they are close to home. I think some things are just a matter of unique preference and I will gladly visit them again for their quality food."

The falafels here are one of my favorite items on the menu. Also I recommend their salads, which are generously sized and are always fresh and tasty. 
The only complaint I have is the staff. But in particular, one employee who was rude and treated me and my father as if we were a burden. But the owner was very nice and brought us out some sauce to try with our chicken and some rice, which was nice. 
Overall, I&#39;d rate Pita BBQ a 4 since the food is outstanding and consistent but the service is not always as promising."

Really glad we came in. The place was nice and clean and inviting. The staff was very friendly, and gave us great advice about what to order. I had a beef shwarma sandwich, and my friend had the beef shwarma platter. The food was somewhat of a hybrid of desi-middle eastern, so you get the best of both worlds. The beef had really great flavor and was soft and tender. A lot of other shwarma places overcook or burn their meat, but this place had it right. I considered trying there hand cut fries to see how they were, but decided to not to since I had already ordered, and the guy working was very nice and gave me some sample fires to try anyway. Again, the staff is very friendly, and the food is very good. Will definitely eat here again when I&#39;m back in this area."

I began coming here not too long ago and I&#39;m completely hooked! It&#39;s fast, fresh, and wonderfully cooked. Today, I ordered something online and noted that last time, I found that there was something very minor with the online order I placed weeks ago. Fortunately and nicely, the two men wanted to inquire more about what happened with the situation and sincerely apologized and offered me more food. They were understanding and relatable. Usually I hate complaining at places because I work in customer service and I understand dealing with complaints. But they assured me that they want to assure the best quality and service - which they always have and will always have! I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try new food or is a sucker for Middle Eastern cuisine. The website is very easy to use and straightforward as well.

I have gone to a LOT of middle eastern restaurants throughout my lifetime and this is definitely one of the best places I have been too.

The selection is excellent and I like the fusion with the basmati rice and the tandoori chicken burger they have.  My personal favorite is the 2 meat meal with gyros and chicken breast with hot sauce and garlic sauce. 

The staff is also very kind and friendly as well.  Check this place out....you&#39;re not going to regret it.  The place is also very clean which is a huge plus and it the meal is always prepared quickly and hot.  

The best part is the price.  I have never paid more than $10 for a full meal which also comes with pita bread and sides of either hummus, salad and filafil."

Atmosphere:
Honestly, there isn&#39;t much to write home about when it comes to interior decorating. This isn&#39;t a date place, but an eat and go place. However the friendly staff do add some charm to the place and the areas are well maintained.

Service:
Pretty standard service at the counter. The staff is friendly enough and will joke around with you here and there. I was given the rundown of all the different meats by a friendly staff member. They are glad to help out so don&#39;t be shy to ask. They also didn&#39;t mind our group of rowdy men...

Food:
Everything is made with fresh and organic ingredients. You see them make everything on the grill and none of it is premade. They also do not skimp out on portions. I personally love the best of both worlds and grab a half and half order of the Chilli Chicken and the Chicken Kabobs. Juicy and Tender with the flavorful spices make it one hearty meal. You can definitely taste how fresh the chicken is and I beg you to at least try it with the sauce! It blends really well together. But... My favorite thing at Mediterranean places tend to be the Pita Bread and the Hummos. It did not disappoint, but it wasn&#39;t the most impressive either. The Hummos is slightly too oily or creamy, and the Pita Bread isn&#39;t as fresh in comparison to how fresh the rest of the meal is. 

This is probably the closest Mediterranean establishment with high quality food in my area. Meaning I will definitely be back for those Hummos cravings. I would recommend this place if you are with a group and are looking to just hang out casually. The food will hit the spot and leave you satisfied."

Actually, there are some things at Pita BBQ that I like better than Naf Naf, and vice versa). They have great options for vegetarians and vegans (I&#39;ve never actually eaten meat here) and very reasonable lunch specials, and everything is delicious!

For dinner, I love to get the vegetarian feast, which comes with falafel, hummus, cilantro chickpeas, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh and pita. I love to combine everything inside the pita and top with a bit of their delicious garlic sauce. The baba ghanoush is perfectly smoky and the falafel have a great crunchy texture. For lunch, they have a smaller option where you pick 3 veggie items with rice and pita for like $5.95!

Now that it&#39;s cold out, they have complimentary hot mint tea and I finally got to try the lentil soup which was taunting me all summer from the menu board (they only serve it in fall/winter). The soup is yummy and really filling!

One thing to keep in mind: we have had a couple of mistakes with our orders here, which they are always happy to correct, but if you get food to go you probably want to check it before you leave.

I&#39;m kind of craving a vegetarian feast now..."

I&#39;ve been eating at Pita BBQ fairly regularly for over a month now, and, because I usually try several items before writing these reviews, I&#39;ve tried most of the menu. This has not been a chore in any way. Here are my thoughts:

1. The Spicy Chili Chicken Wrap/ platter is maybe my favorite chicken dish. Not just here. Anywhere. Seriously. If not, it&#39;s in my top 3. It is also definitive proof that if you like spicy food, your life is clearly better than someone who can&#39;t handle the heat. This dish is similar to an Indian dish, Chicken Makhani. On the wrap, it&#39;s served on a warm, buttery flatbread. I recommend asking for a little rice to absorb some of the sauce (it&#39;s very saucy. and the rice comes at no additional charge). Also, arm yourself with a fork. You may have to eat the wrap down a little. It is really, really stuffed with delicious chicken. If you try nothing else, try this because: holy cow.

2. The Tandoori Chicken Burger is chicken burger perfection. And in the pantheon of burgers available in Chicagoland, you&#39;ve got to give it a shot. It&#39;s delicious. It does take a little longer to make though, so be aware.

3. The gyros are excellent. I once ate a whole one even though I was full halfway though. This was a mistake, but it was fantastic and I was full the rest of the day.

4. The steak in the Steak Schwarma tastes like steak. Not rubber or discount roast beef. Grilled steak.

5. All of the schwarmas are great. And the wrap includes hummus. And the schwarma pita wraps are way less messy than most pita places. They are also (I think) larger than Chipotle burritos.

6. Food comes up pretty quickly. Quickly enough and regularly enough that I am really tempted to go back and dock all of the other pita places I have reviewed a star for speed of service.

7. The people who work at Pita BBQ are so incredibly pleasant. They love what they&#39;re making, and they clearly take pride in their work. I love that.

8. Like most pita restaurants, the dining area could use some work. In general, the way the restaurant is set up is kind of odd, and I&#39;m not sure what they could do to fix it. When you walk in the door, you&#39;re pretty much standing in the pick-up area. You have to walk to the back of the restaurant to order. If it&#39;s not busy, it&#39;s not a big deal, but if it is, it can be a little annoying. The tables in the dining room are mostly all set up like long bench/family style arrangements which is unusual and sometimes, again, it&#39;s inconvenient if you&#39;re trying to get by a crowd at the door. The tables themselves are also kind of lightweight/flimsy so it&#39;s inadvisable to lean on them too much. While the restaurant as a whole is certainly clean, you can also tell that the floors probably need to be stripped and waxed. It&#39;s also a little dark in there around lunchtime, since most of the light in the place comes through the windows.

So although it&#39;s not what I&#39;d call an ideal first date restaurant because of the dining atmosphere, it&#39;s definitely well worth your time, hence, 5 stars. This is hands down my favorite pita place in the area, surpassing even the fabled Sultan&#39;s Market in downtown Chicago and Naf Naf in Naperville, in terms of both flavor and service. If you haven&#39;t already, please join me in helping to make the people at this location as rich as possible in return for Spicy Chili Chicken Wraps. Thank you."

The place was packed, but the food was ready when I got there.  Got the gyros, tandoori chicken burger, and the chicken kabob sandwich. The gyros was not a typical gyros. The meat was cut too thick, wasn&#39;t flavorful, and overall not tasty. The kabob wasn&#39;t ground chicken, but just diced chicken that was just ok. The best thing we got was the chicken tandoori burger. It was moist and flavorful. 
The people there were a bit rude. I was completely ignored when I walked in and stood by the cash register for a few minutes before I had to get someone&#39;s attention. Not sure I&#39;ll be back."

My dad really enjoyed his hummus and pita. I snuck some and loved the hummus - the olive oil especially was delicious. My shwarma wrap was also good, though it fell apart a bit (I used a fork and knife, though I probably could have pressed on otherwise). The chicken shwarma was not as thinly sliced as usual, but it was juicier than most chicken shwarma is! The sauces were delicious, and I love the options they give you for meat, toppings, and such.

I got the chicken tandoori burger. I&#39;ve never had anything like it. Ground chicken patty on a really great bun, with tandoori spices and a tandoori sauce. Spicy, but not overly so. As good as any top shelf burger I&#39;ve ever had.

After disappointing meal after disappointing meal at my local favorite Mediterranean joint, Pita House, Christie B. suggested I make the drive over to Pita BBQ. As always, she never leads me wrong. 

After years of subjecting my taste buds to sub-standard Mediterranean fast food, I&#39;d forgotten how much better the real thing tastes. I&#39;ve taken the flavors I experienced while living in the city for granted but have thankfully rediscovered them here at Pita BBQ. Everything we tasted in the Combo Meal and Hummus that we ordered just bursted with layers of flavor and none of the meat was dry!

At first I gawked at the hefty $12 price tag of the Combo Meal but I figured I would give it a try since I made the trip. Hoping it would be enough for two, I ordered a large hummus just in case. The Combo Meal was definitely enough for two especially if another pita is ordered. It&#39;s a regular sized plate piled with meat and rice from edge to edge. The shawarma is not the solid block processed style either. I&#39;m talkin&#39; individual chunks of meat slid on to a spit so that when they cut pieces off nice chunks of meat fall off instead of shaving of mystery processed meat. That&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be. Even the tabule was fresh and flavorful. In fact, everything had so much flavor that I found myself using a lot less sauce than I do at Pita House.

The only complain I have is that the pitas didn&#39;t seem very fresh. A few pieces were rock hard and none of them were fluffy at all. We may have just gotten a bad batch judging by the quality of the rest of the food.

They have lunch specials here that are a few dollars more than Pita House but I think the quality is more than worth it. Now if I could only get them to move to Schaumburg..."

Tried the lentil soup too.  VERY good and lots in the serving.

Hard to find if not a local.i had a full take out meal with beef pita bread rice and hummus for 8.50 before tax.they prepare the beef and chicken on a open pit.it was a very good meal. The hummus was creamy not so thick wich I like. One warring the prices are higher than on the web sight. 4 stars will be back.

Our power was out, so we decided to make the most of it and go get dinner somewhere far away. Bien Trucha it was!

With the menu running relatively cheap, and becaude these were only a dollar more than soda, my wife got a limonada and I got a mangoneada. Both were bright and fresh, and the mangoneada in particular was quite thick, like a smoothie (mango water is not a good description for this menu item). The rim of chili-based seasoning provided a familiar heat with the drink as well. 

I also ordered esquites, which was grilled corn with lime and cotija. I&#39;d definitely get this again, and it went well with my Atun tacos, or tacos with breaded tuna cubes.

It&#39;s pretty easy to describe the ingredients, but the thing that stands out is the balance of the ingredients. It would be so easy for any of the ingredients on the tacos to overwhelm, and you won&#39;t see me argue against having a fistful of fish on my plate. But no; each bite has the creaminess of the avocado, a little bit of fish, a bit of pickled onion. This is taco perfection.

I&#39;m pleased to say my wife&#39;s Bien Trucha was treated with the same care, only including skirt steak.

I&#39;m hoping to get a trip back here before winter sets in, because the things they&#39;re pulling off deserve the attention they get."

I walked in, as greeted by the hostess, asked where I wanted to sit, and was found a seat to my liking. Then came that menu that had ample choices, but not too many. The plates were unique and pleasing, as were the bathroom sinks, lights, the outdoor setup, and much of the restaurant. The food itself was superb, priced reasonably for what you received, and the service was excellent. I had the signature tacos, and they might have been the best tacos that I&#39;ve ever had. This includes some of the best rated places in Mexico, Texas, and California that I have eaten at.

But this was not our case, we were sat right away and new that we would going to order the Steak Tacos, which we did and then we ordered the Chicken Flautas. They were good but not as good as the Steak Taco&#39;s. The side corn dish was so so so good. The upbeat music that was pumping through this place was putting me in a good mood too.

I had their pepino drink which was the choice drink at the bar since everyone had one. Awesome!!  Next I had their signature Bien Trucha tacos, and again, Awesome!!  I can see why folks will travel from Chicago to here.

My friend and ordered the steak &amp; chorizo tacos, the chicken tacos, and the grilled corn. 

The star was definitely the corn. Both taco types lacked flavor and did not taste as authentic as my cheap local taco joint. The menu felt disjointed with very limited options if you didn&#39;t want tacos or tortas. 

Ok so the service was attentive, but food was lacking any real flavor. I guess it&#39;s catering to the Americanized Mexican pallette... But this non-amateur eater left greatly disappointed. This place is extremely overhyped and overpriced. There are so many better places to get your taco fill."

We ordered guacamole of the day which is mixed with mango and it&#39;s delicious. I can taste the fresh mango in it.

Our only minor complaint about this place is that seating is very tight and their tortillas are not homemade. Other than that the cocktails are to die for and food is delicious. Service was great too! We will definitely be back! Portions are deceptively filling! The Bien Trucha tacos and Pastor tacos were spot on. Try the Mango and Pepino cocktail.

It had just rained outside by the time we got to dinner, so the patio was all closed up. However, as our dinner went on, they slowly opened it back up and had a great waiting spot for people outside. It was probably my favorite thing about the unique set up of the whole restaurant! Tables are a bit crowded together and voices carry/echo throughout, so don&#39;t plan to come here for a quiet dinner.

We started off ordering drinks at the bar, as we had to wait for our (previously reserved) table. House margarita, watermelon marg, and I had the strawberry marg. Our bartender did not skimp on the tequila! They were fresh and very tasty drinks. 

We then got to our table and promptly ordered the guac of the day which had mangoes in it. Real tasty, but I cringed knowing that we paid $9 for the lump of it that we got. We also ordered the Bien Trucha and Pollo tacos, both of which were good. The Pollo comes in a fried tortilla, which I was not expecting. The BT tacos were pretty standard steak tacos with cheese and some sauce drizzled over it. 

All in all it was perfect for the occasion we were there for, and I&#39;m glad to have tried it, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t become a regular here. I&#39;d be bankrupt on my third trip!"

We had the pineapple margarita, Jamica cocktail, steak and al pastor tacos with a side of corn, and vanilla flan. The drinks were good. Tacos were on the smaller side but ok I liked the al pastor more because it had more favor and sauce, as for the steak a bit bland. I didn&#39;t enjoy the vanilla flan it was too sweet.  The side of corn decent it had the Mexican crumbled cheese, ground chili powder, and lemon butter aloli which was different than the norm of lime mayo.

I came with my parents on a relatively quiet Tuesday and asked for a table for 3, and they had us squeeze in at a table for 2. This meant my parents were mashed together on the booth half of a small table and their elbows were basically on the neighboring tables. I know it&#39;s a small place but c&#39;mon, it was not that busy. 

Instead of chips and salsa, they drop off chips and beans at the table.....I&#39;m not sure I have ever heard of this before, but it was not very good. So I asked for salsa to go with the chips (standard and complimentary at 99.9% of places) and the waitress told me she could not just bring salsa, but I would have to order the salsa platter for extra $. 

After that things were pretty average. My tacos al pastor were solid, but the chicken tacos come drenched in a cold sauce that immediately cools off the tacos."

My buddy and I had a reservation last night. I arrived a couple minutes early, and sat at the bar. Ordered a corona, and I was handed a can of it. $5. Not a great first impression. 

Once my friend arrived, we were seated at one of the 10 tables there. No joke, not a huge place. They have a sister restaurant attached, which is only open for lunch. They may seat folks there once they are full, as it&#39;s the same ownership.

We had the tacos, and tortas. We also had some corn appetizer, which was phenomenal. Can&#39;t remember what it was called (Lo Siento, mi espanol es no bueno) but it was a must have. The tacos were great, tortas were nothing special. The meat on the skewer was tough. 

A bill for the two of us was $50, plus tip. While the food was great, it wasn&#39;t worth that much. If they brought their prices down by 20% or so, or increased portion size, it&#39;d be a great spot. 

I also would note that I am all about the larger portions. If you are content with eating a smaller meal, this is a good spot for you."

Be aware though they do not take reservations and it gets crowded. It&#39;s best to go right when they open for lunch or dinner so you do not have to wait long. 

My favorite thing to get there is the pork tacos which have pineapple and a type of salsa on them. I also love the corn dish esquites which is similar to elotes. It has cheese, peppers, mayo, and a few other things in it. 

The staff is fantastic. 

The only thing I don&#39;t like is that it is served tapas style. So you cannot go with a group of people and just get your own thing. They should let you order your own dishes if that is what you want to do. Not everyone likes to eat the same kind of food, so I end up having to share my pork tacos and have nothing of everyone else&#39;s food.

I love the fish tacos and chicken rolled tacos. I&#39;ve tried almost everything on the menu but these are my go-to. This is the only Mexican place in Chicago area that serves authentic rolled tacos. (If you know of others, I always looking for reminders of home do msg me w/ locations, please). I make them at home but nothing compares to well made ones + the delicious (slightly spicy) sauce + cheese they pour on them, YUM! 

The potatoes bravas are delicious as are the beans. You could easily share a guacamole app + each a taco entree. Tacos will more than fill you up since they come four to a serving. I usually end up taking one home. 

The patio in spring/summer is awesome, reminds me of a Miami lounge vibe when they&#39;ve got the DJ going and strawberry margaritas are being sipped. Certainly don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m in Illinois! 

Staff has always been super attentive. On a busy night, keep an eye on the bar seats for folks waiting for tables and slide in there for a shorter or no wait.

At about 4:20, I sidled up to the end the line outside of two rather unobtrusive buildings that one would otherwise mistake for a home on a main street. As it turns out, they are both part of the unique location that entail a primary dining room, a beautiful outdoor bar and dining space, and a separate bar with kitchen service.

Friendly well trained staff greeted us in line with an ipad to arrange our reserved seating, and informed us of our seating options, whereupon sitting outside was deemed the best available. I do appreciate the well organized line management, as it saved us from several would-be line cutters!

After what turned out to be a very short wait after opening, I was greeted with a flurry of professional service by a team of knowledgeable servers, led by both our server and a contentious manager.

Two excellent margaritas later; the guacamole, salsa flight, swordfish tacos with fried taco shells that were so yummy the table next to us tried to steal them, and tilapia fish tacos with home made chips had me longing for a beach in Baja at sunset; and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.

At this rate, they should consider purchasing the vacant lot next door...

I was in the area running an errand, so the fiance and I decided to check this place off my bookmark list. So glad we did! We walked in around 1:00pm on a Thursday afternoon and were seated immediately which seems unheard of based on the reviews.

We ordered the limeade and hibiscus iced tea to start and both were refreshing and delicious. We were also given complimentary chips and a bean dip -- both very tasty. Our waiter mentioned the special guacamole that day had pears in it -- we were intrigued and had to order it. Yum! We also ordered the cazuelitas de camarones and bien trucha tacos, which are supposedly the best items on the menu. For our sides, we decided on the esquites (corn) and arroz poblano (rice). EVERYTHING was SO GOOD! As soon as I took my first bite, I was in heaven. I wish we had known about this place sooner so we could impress our friends who come to the suburbs to visit.

I would be eating Mexican every day if this place was closer to my neighborhood.  Start with the Margarita&#39;s... fresh.  They muddle the limes with the tequila for one awesome drink. Tasted the strawberry as well and .. wow!  OK, on to the food.  Chips were good - the serve with some type of black bean dip.  Different, but decent.  

The plates are meant to share.  The tacos are 4 per plate so, if you come with 4 people, that&#39;s ideal (you don&#39;t want more because the place is small).  We sampled the lunch menu and had the following tacos... A La Diabla (spicy shrimp); Pescado (beer battered tilapia); Pastor (marinated pork); Pollo (crispy chicken - more like flautas than tacos)  And I love that i could sample one of each!  I would rank them, but I can&#39;t .. all a tie for first.

Service also was among the best I ever experienced.  The waters were constantly filled and the chips were constantly refilled.  As I am not often in Geneva, I hear there is a sister place with the same menu in Glen Ellyn which is a bit more drivable for me called Toda Madre... I cannot wait to check it out!"

It is expensive ($3 a taco adds up), but it is worth every penny. We ordered the limeade, too, which was freshly made at the bar. AhhhhhMazing tacos. The Esquites and the rice....

I went here for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. I was surprised the restaurant was still pretty busy. There was about a ten minute wait but we decided to eat at the &#34;chef&#39;s table&#34; and we were seated right away. 

Our server (Lucy) described the handmade margaritas and I decided on the De Lujo margarita. The drink was not too sweet. $12 seems a little high for the size of this margarita but it had a great taste. 

I was very satisfied with the food! We started with the Bien Trucha tacos. The steak had a unique flavor and the roasted tomatillo salsa was perfect on top. 

The server suggested an order of Esquites (grilled corn, epazote butter, lemon aioli, queso cotinga, chile piquin). This is a great choice and will go with any menu item. We also ordered a Capitalina Torta. This is a sandwich with pork, cheese, pineapple, avocado, beans and aioli. 

Overall- They offer tasty food and I would love to go back if I&#39;m in Geneva. Heads up- they close at 3:00 and then reopen for dinner at 5:00. I would recommend getting there early if you&#39;re going for lunch."

Had the following

Ceviche of the day
It had lobster in it. Very good citrus flavor and the spice really sneaks up on you. Nice fresh starter

Guacamole traditional
Basic guacamole. It was fresh and the chips were nice and crispy

Bien Truca Taco
The steak was very tender and I loved the cheese in it. Full of flavor and definitely could have ordered some more of these

Pollo Taco
The tacos are fried into rolls and it reminded me of an eggroll with the crisp and texture. An unexpected dish. More like southwest eggrolls. Enjoyed this one as well

Barriga de Puerco
Pork belly with a lot of flavor. Solid taco. I would say I liked the above 2 better

The tacos here are very small about 2-3 bites and you are done. If you are going with a big group definitely recommend sharing if you like a variety of food. I do appreciate the creativity of this place with tacos and the food is full of brightness and flavor. Way better than some of the fancy mexican that I have had in the city

The only drawback was the crampness of the dining area and how the tables are so tiny. For a restaurant that focuses on small plate there needs to be table space to share that food."

We ordered the monthly ceviche special with lobster! It was $15, which in my opinion is expensive for an appetizer, but it was very delicious! 

We ordered three taco dishes for the three of us: Hongos (mushrooms), Pescadillas (sword fish), and (Pescado). We also got a side of rice. Each taco platter comes with 4 tacos which were plenty and we were quite full by the end!

Our tacos were outstanding! I made my husband swap one of his so we could try each other&#39;s dinner. I had the Bien Trucha steak tacos, while he had the Arrachera steak tacos. I don&#39;t know which ones were better!

Not this one! It totally lived up to every expectation I&#39;ve ever had. The first time I came here, I was starving and I ordered everything I can stuff in my pie hole. Everything was great and super tasty. So I went back the second time just in case I was just hungry the first time, I surely didn&#39;t want to give a place 5 stars for a possibly skewed review because I was starving. Oh man, the second time around was even better! 
Let&#39;s talk taco: bien Trucha, arrachera, and pescado tacos were very good. Bien Trucha and arrachera were made with the most tender and well marinated skirt steak. Pescado is made with breaded tilapia with red cabbage topping. All 3 were soooooo good! You&#39;ll get Turnt Up For Taco guaranteed! #TUFT
Pièce de rèsistance: shrimp cazuelitas. Oh. My. Gawd. To die for. MUST HAVE for sure. The explosion of flavor in this dish is to die for . Totally worth the drive wherever you&#39;re coming from. Best dish I&#39;ve ever had in my life!!! 
Sides: the rice and corn sides were amaze balls 
Drinks: too sweet for my taste. I recommend their sipping tequilas vs their sangria and margarita. 
MAKE YOUR RESERVATION! The wait is no joke. The place is super small and waiting at the bar is not the most ideal. 
Bien Trucha you really are on top of your game!"

The hype is real folks. The hype. Is. Real.

My husband and I came here for Cinco de Mayo this year. I of course have read amazing reviews on Yelp, so I decided what better time to check it out. I know Bien Trucha gets hella busy, so I made sure to make a reservation online. It was the morning of cinco de mayo when I checked their availability and luckily we were able to snag their last rezzy! I guess it was meant to be.

Although we arrived right on time (6:45 p.m.), I don&#39;t think we were actually seated until about 7. I kind of was prepared for this though, being the holiday and all. What I wasn&#39;t prepared for was the shuffle between two separate buildings. Thanks to Angela P.&#39;s review, I knew A Toda Madre was connected to BT and is basically the same thing so I wasn&#39;t too concerned. It was rather annoying though how the hostess at BT told us we&#39;d be seated faster next door, and then that host sent us back to where we originally were.

When this shuffle calmed down we still ended up sitting at the bar and ordering a drink until our table was ready. They had a $5 classic margarita special, so that kept me calm, cool, and collected while we waited. About 15 minutes later we were sat at a quaint 2 person table in the side room. Our waitress greeted us right away and was super helpful.

I love the ambiance of the restaurant (although pretty small). A wine bottle-esque pitcher of water was on the table, along with a candle, stylish plates and a simple menu. The scene is perfect for a date night or a girls night out.

We started with their classic guacamole and were also given complimentary pinto bean dip. Both were delicious and addicting. Their homemade tortilla chips stood out to me. I&#39;m not sure what it was, but they had the perfect crunch and were not over-salted. It&#39;s safe to say we accidentally filled up pretty well on these pre dinner snacks.

Their food is served basically tapas style, so we were instructed to order a few different things to share and they would come out one after another. I really like this concept, however when all was said and done the hubbie and I agreed that we ate too fast in anticipation of the next delicious item coming out!

We ordered as follows:

Cazuelitas de camarones -- sautéed shrimp, red onion, garlic, cilantro-chimichurri, and chihuahua cheese served with tortillas (this was basically a make-your-own quesadilla and it was amazing!)

Bien Trucha tacos (4) -- grilled skirt steak, chorizo, chihuahua, roasted tomatillo salso

Pescadillas tacos (4) -- shredded swordfish, epazote, crispy tortilla, avocado-habanero pico 

Everything was absolutely amazing. I&#39;m talkin every time either of us took a bite we did that like full mouth &#34;mm hhmm, that&#39;s really good&#34; nod to each other. I literally can&#39;t wait to come back. These are fresh and unique Mexican flavors I&#39;ve never had before. It&#39;s a modern Mexican menu so sure, I&#39;ve had more &#34;authentic feeling&#34; entrees, but Bien Trucha is something special.

Definitely go check &#39;em out. Like, NOW!"

Great outdoor seating although we sat inside to get a break with the air conditioning since we were out in the afternoon enjoying Swedish Days. The tacos came in miniature across a wood plank and my wife and I shared the tuna and swordfish tacos. The swordfish were spicy in a crunchy shell where the tuna was wonderful in soft shell with salad garnish. It was very busy but wait staff very friendly and attentive. We had fresh guacamole with chips while waiting for our entree. Everything was provided timely but never felt rushed. My wife enjoyed the mango water with her meal. Great place and will definitely be back.

Since whenever we happen to be in their area it&#39;s lunch time but they don&#39;t take reservations for lunch and the line is usually down the block...and places with a lot of &#34;OMG you MUST go there!&#34; hype tend to disappoint me.  A few years later the planets aligned to a rainy Saturday where we would be in Saint Charles.  I hoped the rain would work in our favor keeping the throngs at bay for a bit so we could give them a try for lunch.  We arrived right before opening and we were rewarded with immediate seating.  The place filled up within an hour of their opening, however - but there wasn&#39;t a line to get in so a crummy weather day is a good time to give them a try if you can&#39;t make it for a dinner rez time slot. 

I&#39;d say the food was 4 - 5 stars and the service was 1 - 3 stars so I&#39;m going to settle on 3 stars.  It&#39;s tapas style but they have teeny tables so plan on just ordering 1 - 2 things at a time.  We tried the Esquites (roasted corn - amazing &amp; my dining companion who normally doesn&#39;t like corn gobbled it up!), the Bien Trucha tacos (skirt steak &amp; chorizo) &amp; the Atun tacos (tuna) - both tacos were delicious.  We also tried 2 of the margaritias (the melon, a special that day, &amp; the avocado) &amp; the sangria - all were tasty but they really don&#39;t give you much at all and they don&#39;t give you much &#34;kick&#34; if you know what I mean, either.  If I&#39;m paying $9 (sangria) - $11/12 (margaritas) each I would like it to be a least a bit stronger.

Our server was kind and explained the menu to us and she checked on us regularly.  We had 2 gripes with the service.  One was right after our margaritias arrived my dining companion picked it up  to move it to the side and make room for the food and the glass just slipped right out of his hand.  I&#39;m not sure if it was a bit of grease from the tortilla chips or what but he picked it up &amp; the glass immediately slipped out and spilled all over the table &amp; him.  Now this occurred when a bus boy was watching 2 feet away &amp; our server was at the next table taking their order.  Not a single person came over to help clean up the mess and we had to ask the bus boy to bring us new napkins &amp; plates.  That was a rather irritating start so I&#39;m glad the food was delicious to even out their star rating.  The second gripe was regarding the small basket of tortilla chips &amp; a bean dip they bring you when you sit down.  We finished our chips &amp; still had half the bean dip left.  The bus boy took away our empty basket for chips &amp; left the bean dip but never brought any more chips.  I did overhear another table asking for chips so perhaps you have to ask? Just not sure why they wouldn&#39;t ask us if we wanted more chips (most servers at other places ask), especially if they are going to leave the bean dip on the table. 

After all is said and done I probably wouldn&#39;t bother going back.  Good to give them a try, at least, though."

We tried three different tacos bein trucha house special, shrimp and chicken which came with corn and cheese rice. All i can say is ummm im loving it. The tacos tasted fresh and just melted in the mouth. The sides were as good as the tacos. This is the best mexican food i had.

i made a reservation, which was nice so we did not have to wait (i don&#39;t think this place is worth waiting for). we  had the cerviche, which was delicious. i also had the sangria, which i highly recommend. we ate the pastor and diablo tacos which were outstanding. we had the flan for dessert, which was a nice way to end the meal. 

overall though, i wouldn&#39;t be in a rush to go back here. at least during busy times. i prefer el molcajete instead - you can get the same quality of food, without the pretentiousness."

So when I first crunched into a magnificently, impossibly fresh tuna taco adorned with baby arugula, celery aioli and avocado at Bien Trucha, an unassuming little joint on the edge of downtown Geneva, every expletive I knew shot through my head within a nanosecond. And the bill for guac, twelve tacos and four margaritas came to just about $80. (I wasn&#39;t dining alone, I swear!)

As I munched on house-made totopos and that exemplary guacamole, freshened with the tang of tomatillo, I thought, &#34;Could Rick Bayless somehow be behind this?&#34;

Nope. Turns out Mexico City-bred chef/owner Ricardo Garcia-Rubio, although a decades-long kitchen vet, had never garnered any kind of real attention or seen much success before opening Bien Trucha in 2007. Now, eight years later, after an expansion and much local and national acclaim, it seems Chef is right where he needs to be.

He&#39;s certainly farther away from Lakeview than I&#39;d like; I would eat at Bien almost every week if he were within a five-mile radius. I randomly crave those tuna tacos. Other times my mouth waters at the thought of crunchy tortillas stacked with juicy, epazote-scented swordfish and avocado-chile pico de gallo. Even the skirt steak tacos, slightly overshadowed by the oceanic treats, pop into mind. I even miss the simple but ridiculously addictive white rice, dotted with bits of roasted poblano and creamy-gooey with crema and Chihuahua cheese. 

My only complaint aside from distance is that the margaritas, while delicious (especially the cucumber &#34;Pepino&#34;), are rather small and low on booze. I may prefer my tequila drinks more bracing than most people, but these might not do the job for even the lightest-weight lightweight in your group. 

I suppose that means that, pocketbook permitting, you ought to have an extra cocktail. The experience is otherwise worth savoring."

It was recommended by a friend! We had a bad start to the experience as we had just gotten coffees while shopping and the employee who greeted us at the door told us we could not bring in any outside drinks. In a way, I guess it makes sense, but it&#39;s not like we were bringing in a bottle of wine or vodka. Besides, I think I ordered water anyways so it wouldn&#39;t have made a big deal. Anyways, aside from that our service was good and the food was great! I enjoyed the portion sizes of the tacos as it was just the right amount!

After spending a relaxing Saturday afternoon in the area, we decided to venture over to Geneva and try our luck. Without reservations, we got in line around 4:30 for their 5 o&#39;clock dinner opening. Great timing as we were the third group in line. The weather was perfect to sit outside in their outdoor dining area under the canopy. Once 5:00 pm came, the line was to the end of the block. I was just hoping that the tacos lived up to the hype!
Once we were seated, our server got right to work, greeting us and offering information about their specials. I ordered a watermelon margarita for myself and the traditional guacamole for the table. We ordered tacos to share and decided on shrimp, tuna and chicken. The tacos came in orders of 4. 
At first, our food came almost immediately, and I had the feeling that because this restaurant is so busy, we would be rushed out in order to turn over the table for the next guests. That could have been the case but our order of chicken tacos took an extremely long time. That was fine by us as we were there to enjoy the atmosphere and the beautiful weather. 
This place is definitely a low key restaurant with more of an upscale, fine dining feel than one would expect at first glance. I&#39;d say the tacos were worth the wait. Next time, Id love to get a reservation to try more of what&#39;s on their menu."

This place is very small so if you aren&#39;t a fan of siting close together for dinner, I suggest visiting during patio season, there&#39;s a little more room out there. They start off your dining experience by bring a bean dip with chips. The bean dip seems to have a hint of chipotle and is tasty. The pepino margarita they have is too good. It is pricey, but it&#39;s one of those things that you don&#39;t feel guilty splurging on because it&#39;s delicious. The guacamole is a must. They do have a special guacamole (Guacamole del Dia) where fresh fruit is added, by chef&#39;s choice and we always try it and have never been disappointed. The tacos are flavorful and have unique combinations on them.( I would not describe them as authentic mexican tacos at all, but more of a taco with a modern twist) The Arrachera tacos are one of my favorites. It&#39;s steak with onions, avocado and salsa. If you don&#39;t mind paying a little more for a upscale feel, then this is the place for you.

All the other reviews  do not lie. Bein Trucha is simply incredible food. My husband and I tried the tacos (pollo and bein trucha) and we are going to come back tomorrow for lunch again. Fun and inviting atmosphere with fantastic food and drinks is an understatement. Try it before you miss out! Buen provecho!

The corn is the best I have ever tasted.  I would come back just for that dish.  Tried the skirt steak and pork belly tacos -- both were excellent.  The service was fast and friendly but not intrusive.   The margaritas were fresh squeezed but a little sour for my personal taste.  A good choice for creative Mexican.

I was treating my daughters to a &#34;girls day out&#34; and the wait time was 15 minutes for a table so we decided to sit at the bar.  We were the only three at the bar the whole time.  The bartender/server placed three menus in front of us and we chose our meals.  He ignored us for the most part and when we asked him for an explanation of some of the menu headings in spanish, he would mumble an answer that none of us could make out.  Two of our dishes came out at the same time and when the third came out about 5-6 minutes later, my daughter said, &#34;oh, I didn&#39;t know it&#39;s fried&#34; and the bartender responded with &#34;did you read the menu?&#34;  Now looking at the meals description of &#34;pollo&#34; under Tacos it says &#34;crispy rolled&#34; which still doesn&#39;t explain the &#34;deep fried&#34; meal that was given to her.  She explained that she is pregnant and has indigestion issues and he walked away.  So, the food was good and the service was ridiculously near non-existent and in your face rude...which is ironic since he wasn&#39;t busy mixing drinks, helping other diners, etc.  He would tell our order to one of the other servers and then they would hand the dishes to him and he would place them in front of us.  Spoke to the manager and she said that if we were coming back that she would like to make it up to us...my question is, &#34;why would I come back?&#34;"

It was quaint, great and amazing.  I went back last night with some friends and I was beyond excited. However, I have learned high expectations can lead to disappointing results. 

We went in, grabbed four drinks (at 50 dollars total... Am I back in bora bora?) and went outside to sit and wait for our table. I really liked having this option as I a quite am a people watcher.  Our table was called on time and we were brought to the building I ate at the first time. 

On to the order! 
They were out of cerviche, which was disappointing but it was also 830, so my bad.  We ordered pork belly, fish, steak, and pork tacos along with the corn and salsa. 

Everything was mediocre and the flavors were not what I remembered. I think what drove me the most crazy was that everything came out at the same time.  Even our chips and salsa. The tables are tiny there and there was no room for anything.  They had us take the tacos off the platters so they could take the platters away right then and there.  Thanks for the rush...   Maybe invest in a larger table? 

The neat thing was as we were leaving my friend spotted a semi famous celebrity couple eating there too."

Though the restaurant interior is a little dark, the pastor tacos are flavored brightly. Citrusy, juicy, oniony, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The fruit guacamole and chicken tacos were also excellent, but the pastor tacos need more Yelp love. And here I thought I&#39;d only travel to Geneva for Swedish Days and ACK. Way to impress, Bien Trucha.

This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants ever and it is definitely worth the wait. Bien Trucha owns two buildings that are separated by their outdoor patio. One restaurant is for reservations and the other is seated on a first come first serve basis. I would strongly suggest that you make reservations as soon as possible as they get booked fast and sometimes it can take a month to reserve a prime time on a Friday or Saturday. 
We always have a large group and so we usually order pretty much everything on the menu. The drinks are phenomenal! My favorite of them all is the Ahuacatl. They give you complimentary homemade chips and bean dip and a must order is the salsa trio and the traditional guacamole. Another must order are the side dishes of rice and corn and the pescado tacos. I make it my mission to try fish tacos across the country and these are my favorite by far. Obviously with the amount of visits that I have had, I have tried just about everything on the menu and I have absolutely no complaints. Everything is delicious!"

They need to change that so i can try different things. Then they need to make more unique tacos still the same ones.

Free appetizer:  its frizoles and chips the chips are fresh not greasy seasoned well the beans are really good i just eat all the cheeze in it then i stop not to get too fool

Ceviche del mes: i ordered this twice both completely different the first time it was really unique sometjing i never had before this time it was more traditional but still amazing its gormea so it has high quality ingredients in it then i love the salad in the bottom its not diluted  with water like alot of mexican restaurants must order!

Cazulita de camarones: this is the best dish here its so good the shrimp are cooked perfectly the sauce is really rich but a lil sour the perfect balance. The cheese underneath is to die for its so good its like a mexican fondue i wish they put more shrimp in it though u have to order this

Barriga de puerco: this was really good the sauce was really good to but i like my pork belly fried and its not fried 

Pescado taco: this was the best taco i have ever eaten its perfectly fried really crispy not greasy perfectly cooked not overcooked or dried seasoned really well the coleslaw is so fricken good adds so much richness to make it so decadent.

Atun taco: its really crispy but not greasy seasoned really nicely the sauce was really good i wish there was more surprised there was alot of tuna fish the salad on top was really good just wish that there was coleslaw instead  really good though 

Soup: crema de chile poblano: omg this was so fucking good i didnt expect anything of it i just ordered it cause it was cheap wow did this have so much flavor it was so rich one of the best soups i ever had it had a lil bit of smokey flavor not alot perfect for cold days comes with bread but i used the chips for crunch. Theres cheeze and potatoes at the bottom needs more though

Brocheta de carne: its a mexican shish kabob. It was cookd perfectly it was medium rare and the vetables werent overcooked wasnt to burned either the dipping cause was good could be better though it needed salt though the seasoning wasnt that good wouldnt order again

Enchiladas: umm this was my least favorite it was way to sweet was more like a dessert. And tasted like the can mole to be honest idk if they used it but tasted really similar to it. 

Mexican Corn appetizer: i love mexican corn but this wasnt really that good it needed sAlt jus had no wow factor i had better

Arrachera taco: this was my least favorite taco it was to plain i tasted almost everything off the menu and this had no wow factor the bien trucha is a way better steak taco i wouldnt order this again

Bien trucha taco: this was my favorite steak taco here its so good. The steak is cooked perfectly supper tender and flavorful. I love the cheese theres alot which is good. Then the salsa on top is so delicous not spicy just the right balance. Then theres chorizo on it which makes it even better not burned! Or really greasy.

Oysters: really fresh really delicious just i wish there was more condiments like horshradish theres just a black sauce and a red sauce needs a wow factor

Churros: this was my least favorite thing i ate here they were overfried and no sugar or cinnamon on any of them i had to ask for it.

Key lime pie: i hate key lime pie i dont really like things really sour but this was so fucking good it wasnt sour at all  the icecream was perfect not overturned not to sweet perfect texture. The crust at the bottom was supper crispy added alot of texture then theres  meringue that is blow torched so good not to sweet. Must order 

Corn cake: u have to order this one of the best desserts of my life u have to order this supper moist and flavorful the sauce is to die for theres tequila in it that really enhances the flavor of the cake its amaizing u have to get it"

When we first moved here, the word on the street was that this was the best in town.  While I will say that we enjoyed our time here, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go out of my way to go back.  This is because, like other reviewers, I found the place to be a bit pretentious and over-priced.  The food was fantastic, although I would have expected almost twice the amount of food I got for the price I paid.  (More because of the portion sizes are very small).  Also, I would agree that I felt rushed to eat/leave, and don&#39;t even bother trying to bring kids.

That being said, the corn and rice was some of the best I have ever had.  If this environment sounds like your cup of tea you won&#39;t be disappointed.  Just be prepared for what&#39;s in store for your visit."

I have eaten at this restaurant prior and it is amazing. I was truely dying to go back and was very excited the patio opened. Having said that the first two times I dined there I was pregnant the third my baby was very young and still in her infant car seat. 
On his particular evening we arrived and the hostess said it was 30-60 min wait. Mind you we tried to call for call ahead seating and the line was no response. I did mention this upon arrival and the answer I received was that they only have three phone lines so if all are in use they can&#39;t accommodate. We said ok we&#39;ll wait. I went to use the washroom and when I returned my husband was already seated. So about 5 minutes. Strange to say the least. They brought me to the table my husband and daughter were at. My daughter is 1 1/2. She was sitting on his lap. He said they don&#39;t have high chairs or boosters. (Something they should have told me from the beginning) ok fine this isn&#39;t going to work I thought. We left. I mentioned to the hostess on the way out I&#39;m sorry you don&#39;t have high chairs. We can&#39;t stay. 
There wasn&#39;t this sincere apology or anything of the sort. I almost felt like they were happy. I was truely disappointed and felt like it was because of our daughter. If kids aren&#39;t allowed then have a sign and post that. We dine out with our baby all the time. She is very well behaved. I mean who doesn&#39;t have high chairs.

This three star review is simply because of a simple &#34;we can&#39;t do that.&#34; I asked to have a Mojito made without the rum...I even went through the special drink menu to find the drink with the least amount of alcohol to make it uncomplicated. When I asked our waitress if they could make it &#34;virgin&#34; she said that they can&#39;t because they want to keep the consistency the same with all their drinks/food. What?! The funny thing is they would make me another special drink that was nonalcoholic but add mint for $1.00....does that make sense at all?! So you can compromise the taste of one drink but not another?

It&#39;s disappointing because as someone who might not always want a cocktail it is nice to see restaurants be accommodating especially with such simple requests....and kind of stupid when they arent."

We called in and they put us on the list. We received a text just as we pulled up that our table was ready. They sat us at the Chef&#39;s table (bar). That was a nice experience as you can watch them cook and interact if you choose. Our waiter was friendly. The menu has great options. Mexican beer for $5 is nice. Glad they don&#39;t up charge the beer too much as an &#34;import&#34;. Margaritas starting at $9 and up to $12. Well, it&#39;s all fresh and mostly organic ingredients so I feel it&#39;s worth it. 

Chips and bean dip delivered complimentary. Very fresh. We ordered the guacamole as I tend to judge a place like this based solely on how fresh it is. NICELY done. We actually watched them prepare it. My wife ordered the special. Yellowfin snapper that was butterflied and grilled. Simply seasoned and perfect. Grilled lemon was a nice touch. Came with a red cabbage salad and tortillas. Delicious. 
I ordered the Pastor tacos. Very, very good. 

The place has a cool vibe. Very clean and noisy for what you&#39;d expect on a Friday night. They even have an outdoor patio area with heat lamps and shade sails. Wife reports that the bathroom was clean as well. A true gem for the suburbs. If you choose to skip this place, great.

Atmosphere. Deep house music over the PA system. Nice! Outdoor seating with couches while you wait to be seated.

Food. I was expecting a larger menu but it turns out all they do is gourmet tacos and a few sides along with the typical salsas. Everything we had tasted very good.

Service: It was good. Nice, friendly waiter.

What I didn&#39;t like:

It&#39;s a little pricey but hey, it&#39;s Geneva and we just got back from Vegas so we knew weren&#39;t gonna get taqueria or Taco Bell prices. I thought the size of the tacos was OK. They weren&#39;t big but they hit the spot. Ordered a habanero salsa and I got an ounce and a half for $5. Ouch. Was expecting more items on the menu such as entrees considering all the buzz this place has but now I know if and when I go back not to expect more than tacos.

I would go back if I felt like gourmet tacos and wanted to eat outside with a group. I wouldn&#39;t go if i wanted authentic Mexican food in the form of entrees.

Edit. When I got my receipt, the habanero salsa was $2. I must have remembered the price on the menu which was $5."

This last visit we started with a salad that was just heavenly: arugula, Granny Smith apples, cheese, nuts and some delicious lemony dressing. We also had the Bien Trucha tacos again and the Pescado and Pastor tacos, which were both amazing. The pork belly tacos were our 4th choice and to me, fell short of expectations since they weren&#39;t as crispy as I typically like. Service was great.

The first time you ride a bike, your wedding day, the birth of your children. Now add to the list, the first time you try Bien Trucha. 

Even with all the food options of Chicago, the modern house-turned-restaurant stole the show.

After being seated quickly my server suggested a few options and I settled on the Bien Trucha tacos (I figured it has to be good if they named the restaurant after it) and the Esquites, a mixture of roasted corn, epazote-butter, spices and lemon juice. It&#39;s hard to live up to the hype of the 29 Zagat score posted at the door and all the other reviews you have surely read below, but I&#39;m here to tell you it was far exceeded. The flavor was amazing. To the point I brought my wife back THE SAME DAY for dinner. Which you better be early to because by the time 5:00 PM rolls around there is a line of 30+ people. 

Regardless of what you choose to get, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get the Esquites. You can put it on any taco and its guaranteed to knock your socks off. Take a bite, BOOM, no socks. 

Bottom line- Bien Trucha is worth any wait, any drive, and sort of service. It is that good."

Their sister restaurant &#39;a toda madre&#39; in Glen Ellyn is great as well, but if I&#39;m picking one or the other..it&#39;s Bien Trucha that takes the cake."

We were literally out the door in 30 mins. This included drinks, guacamole &amp; entrees. 

For those wanting to try it out, the pepino margarita is really good, as is the a la diabla (shrimp tacos). Guac was mango today--another winner. 

The place was nearly empty at 5p on a Tuesday, however that didn&#39;t stop the waiter from rushing &amp; the bus staff clearing each plate before we set it down. Rushing with a long wait list on a weekend? Passable. But on a Tuesday when it&#39;s deserted? 

Despite the food, the consistently poor service is enough to keep us from coming back again any time soon--if ever."

We ended up needing to make more food for my Husband when we got home.  With not having that many seats throughout the restaurant , we understand they need to turn tables over, but our experience seemed rushed. E.g the second we drank out of our water glass, it was refilled , as soon as we took the last bit of food off of the appetizer plate it was taken away. Very clean and nice staff but we started to feel like we were being hovered over. We would rather go eat at Sergios  down the street for larger portions and a more relaxed atmosphere."

I visited today (a Monday) at 11:30am and had to park all the way by the entrance of Sushi Station. That&#39;s a LONG walk in freezing temps! There were plenty of seats inside too so they weren&#39;t crazy-busy, but the parking for the Starbuck&#39;s/Panera spills over into other lots.

My son&#39;s kid&#39;s meal was fine, but the bread that came with my broccoli cheddar soup was stale - yesterday&#39;s bread for sure. It was hard and not at all the baguette I&#39;m used to from other Panera locations - in fact, it wasn&#39;t even a baguette, it was a piece of cut-up Italian bread. I was disappointed because I love the soft baguettes I usually get at Panera."

But beware when you see empty parking spaces at this Panera -- I feel it is not safe to eat here. Locals may know to steer clear.

My experience was as follows -- take it under advisement. I stopped by here on a recent morning because the lot was entirely full at the nearby Burnt Toast Restaurant -- not a single space left. I felt as if I had won the lottery when I walked into this Panera and it was not busy. No waiting! Now I know that I should have been on my guard from the start.

I ordered a breakfast sandwich and a mocha latte with extra espresso. I paid for it and sat down at a window seat to wait patiently.

Fifteen minutes later, the staff tells me they don&#39;t have breakfast sandwiches (because it was after 11 a.m.) and that I could order another sandwich at no cost. A sever takes my order and manager Aimee refunded my sandwich purchase. I sat back down by the window with my drink and wait patiently.

Twenty minutes later, my name hasn&#39;t been called, so I go up and ask about my sandwich. It turns out that no one has made it yet. It wasn&#39;t important enough for them to MAKE the sandwich they needed to make in order to make up for the one they sold me that was not available. (Stay tuned: This is not the worst part by a long shot.)

Manager Aimee tells me &#34;well, at least you didn&#39;t pay for it.&#34;

I replied to Aimee: &#34;I would pay any amount of money to get a sandwich and to get out of here.&#34; I had appointments to keep and this quick stop for food and a coffee drink was taking entirely too long.

About 15 minutes later, a &#34;cook&#34; handed me a steak sandwich that was warm on the outside bun but was cold, red and bleeding on the inside. I am not exaggerating. There was blood on the bun and on the plate. It was not rare. It was raw. The steak was cold to the touch and unsafe to eat at any cost.

This is my second bad experience at a Panera. The other was in Michigan.

If other Panera locations provide the level of service I have experienced here, then I have no idea how Panera stays in business AND how they keep from making customers sick.

This location needs to be closed and the staff should be retrained. It is that bad.

I view this Panera location as a ServSafe learning opportunity -- not a place to which the public should be invited to eat.

The one time I decided to go exploring through the town, I got lost and it took me about 20 minutes to find my way back to work. Needless to stay, I stick on the main roads now.

Anyway, this Panera location is ALWAYS busy during lunch. If you come between 12 and 1, you&#39;ll be circling the parking lot for a while until you find a space. There&#39;s parking by Sushi Station, but I don&#39;t want to risk parking there if I&#39;m not going to eat there. Also, if you do end up finding a parking spot, finding a table becomes another problem. They have tables outside, but that&#39;s not really an option during the winter. The busy-ness is my only complaint, and that&#39;s not really Panera&#39;s fault, though the lack of parking may be.

As for the food, it&#39;s always good. It&#39;s like getting a homemade lunch, which it kind of is because everything is made right there. Their soups are good. Check out their website to see what day they&#39;re serving which soup. I always miss out on chicken and wild rice day which sucks because that&#39;s my fave. I&#39;m a big fan of their tomato and mozzarella panini as well as the mac and cheese. The latter is a bit on the fattening side, but sometimes I just don&#39;t care.

Their salads are huge! It&#39;s probably too much to eat for one sitting, so I recommend getting the smaller portion, or doing the You Pick 2 option where you get a half portion of either soup or salad and a sandwich. Price goes up if you&#39;re picking a signature item. 

For always being super busy when I go, the service is great. The cashiers are attentive. Even if they have a line and you order a lemonade or green tea, they make sure they get it for you right away. Focus is always on the customer in front of them. Even when I&#39;m sitting down eating, they&#39;ll sometimes come by and make sure I&#39;m doing okay or take your plate when your done. I just have to come at 1 to save my sanity."

Chicken was hot and cooked well, and the sautéed onions were perfectly cooked, but they unexpectedly put it on a bed of lettuce. You know what happens to lettuce under hit food? It becomes disgustingly wilted. Ruined the dish.

I was so excited, the first thing I did was texted one of my friends and told her that we need to check this place out. We ended up going here the following weekend. The new location is literally across the street from the old one. I really like the interior designs of this place. It seems so much bigger and cleaner compares to the old one. 

We started off with Spring Rolls and it was decent. It was not OMG amazing, but at the same time, it was not horrible. I actually prefer the Spring Rolls at Green Basil a little bit more. However, I actually like the Com Suon Nuong at this place a lot more. The Com Suon Nuong comes with a pork chop and shredded pork. For a dollar more, you can add an egg or the Vietnamese sausages.

My ONLY suggestion is allow the option for tofu to be swapped in for meat/seafood dishes. Some tofu spring rolls or salt and pepper tofu would have been BOMB!!!"

I got the shrimp and broccoli option and it was a bit too salty for my liking. The egg drop soup and egg roll was really yummy but the fried rice was a bit dry and too salty. I love their Vietnamese iced coffee here so definitely get that if you need some caffeine in your system.

The rice platter w/ the pork and a fried egg on top is a favorite among my friends and I. It is super filling and worth the price (~$11). The pho is okay, nothing spectacular but it gets the job done if you are hungover.

Service is great and the price is reasonable. Parking is easy and free around the area."

I ordered the beef pho and my boyfriend ordered the chicken vermicelli. The noodles were stuck together in my bowl, I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s because the broth wasn&#39;t hot enough to soften it. Also,  there were barely any meat in my bowl. My boyfriend also had the issues with his vermicelli bowl, there was barely any chicken in it. On top of that, there was lettuce in his bowl. I have never seen this meal served with lettuce and there&#39;s probably good reason to it. The lettuce was on the bottom of the hot food and was wilted by the time he got to it."

The wait seemed to take forever but it was worth it. Luckily their food is just as great as before with the exception of the mongolian beef. This time it tasted fishy, like someone went overboard with the oyster sauce. So that was a disappointment. My only other complaint was it&#39;s pretty cold inside. I get it, heat is expensive, but I want to be comfortable and relax when dining out. Hopefully it was an anomaly as I would hate to have to avoid the place until it warms up outside. 

Now for the good stuff - I love that each dish now comes with its own side of rice. In the past when we order multiple dishes, they&#39;d bring them out with just a plate of rice and not offer to bring more. This time we ordered four dishes because we were so excited they were back in business and wanted to enjoy the food for multiple meals. Each dish came with it&#39;s own rice so we didn&#39;t have to make our own at home. I also like that they now have lunch specials every day of the week. We will definitely take advantage of that since my favorite dish, Kung Pao chicken, is on the that list.

Yes, ladies and gents, they officially REOPENED!! I&#39;ve been hoping because this is the only place I know close to me that has the BEST PHO in the western suburbs.
Absolutely beautiful new location! Space wise, it&#39;s a little bit bigger. But much BRIGHTER and MODERN DECOR. It has a rustic industrial motif and they still have their lucky Buddha but this time, it&#39;s against the wall for all to see.  Beautiful photography on the walls to show customers their origin. No more &#34;My heart will go on&#34; instrumental music. You&#39;re greeted now with Justin Bieber&#39;s &#34;Sorry.&#34; 
The menu is nice and simple.  One side is the Vietnamese dishes and the other side is their Chinese dishes. And THANKFUL their Pho is still amazing.  You know the Pho is good when the broth is so clear and just clean tasting. You can choose beef broth or chicken broth.  The spice of the broth and the ingredients are just fantastic!  
Nice and friendly service as usual. They are quick and hospitable. SUPER EXCITED they are back and in full swing!"

Had I rated it back then, the most I would&#39;ve given it would be a 3.5, if half stars were possible. This is because it was an example of the typical Asian restaurant with dirty floor, icky restroom, non-engaging staff, unedited printed menu in cheap/old plastic cover, old dishes/chopsticks/utensils, etc., etc., and I wasn&#39;t eager to bring visitors there. BUT NOW at the new location just across the street, Luong Loi is an Asian restaurant I am proud to bring visitors to! Not only is the venue snazzy and well decorated, but the printed menu is smart, there are new young staff who engage their customers and smile, the entrees are the same delicious taste, but better presented, and the restrooms are nice!

First, we had been frequenting this establishment&#39;s original location for years, where the atmosphere was a dive, but the food and service were always very good. We were so looking forward to their new location across the street. Tried this new site several times, where there is almost an upscale atmosphere, still good food, but the service has gone from an A- to an F. Those first visits we chalked it up to being unprepared for increased business at the new location/ until last night! Saturday night, yes it&#39;s busy but no wait for a table. My husband, son and I arrive at 6:05 and order within 5 minutes with the older gentleman/owner, who never returns. Receive drinks reasonably quickly, then wait until 7:05 - one hour- for one appetizer to arrive, lemongrass beef skewers, which must have been sitting in the kitchen so long, they were absolutely cold. Ate those as we were starving by now. At 7:20 my son and I receive our meals, with no food or server in site for my husband. Wait 10 more minutes, get up and chase down 2 staff about missing meal, no apologies, just , &#34;We&#39;re busy.&#34; Still no food or server EVER arrives for my husband.

ADVICE: Save the aggravation/miserable experience and head over to Simply Thai Bistro on Liberty St. for an excellent meal with great attentive service and relaxing atmosphere.

I ordered #19 the beef noodle soup, of course, and the egg rolls. I&#39;ve loved the egg rolls for years, they&#39;re super crisp and the carrot dressing on the side adds a nice sweetness. Their egg rolls are a perfect appetizer while waiting for the soup. The beef noodle soup was so good. I feel like the portion size got bigger (??). The broth is very clean tasting compared to other pho restaurants. There is very little fat/oil on top as that part is skimmed off. The portion of veggies they give you was perfect for the size of the soup. 

The service was great as well. We got seated right away and waiter was very polite. The grandpa who would pour the water was very cute as well. 

Overall, well done Luong Loi on moving locations. I love it and will definitely be returning."

I didn&#39;t get a good read off my husband, but I think he liked his, but wasn&#39;t his favorite. The wontons we also got where good. Nice and hot so you knew it was fresh.

Went here because of the reviews and was expecting a gem. I was very underwhelmed. Food was greasy. Sushi was stale looking and tasting; thankfully I stayed away from anything raw. 

Hibachi was disgusting. The beef was sitting out there for a while and was just sticking together becoming mush. The egg tray had several cracked eggs in it. The guy cooking was untrained and working on a small fry top. I got the teriyaki sauce but you couldn&#39;t tell there was sauce on it at all. 

Deserts were tasteless except for this cinnamon apple bunt cake thing that was surprising good. Doubt they made it in house based on the rest of the food. 

It&#39;s 4:30am and both my gf and I are having upset stomachs. I&#39;m hoping this is not the beginning of food poisoning. For what this was... 30 bucks for 2 people to eat here is too much."

Every couple of months there is a new sign out front with a different name, and different owners. I&#39;m always hearing about people getting sick after eating here. 

On another note, every time Ive gone here I go to the hibachi grill and it&#39;s good for a quick fresh meal unlike the buffet. They aren&#39;t really friendly here and most of the time the chefs at the grill make me feel guilty for bringing a plate of food for them to cook so frequently."

Their sushi is good, although, I am not a sushi expert, I know nothing about it other than I enjoy a good rookie roll (California roll, Philly roll, etc.)

Food is HOT!  I enjoyed the Mongolian Beef and some of their other meat dishes.  I like the fact that it tastes as if they just made it just for you.  It doesn&#39;t taste like Chinese buffet food.

I have not tried the Hibachi yet.  

Server and host were very nice and friendly.  There are TVs too, so you can watch Cubs games at lunchtime.

This place has a nice ambiance; dark wood chairs and tables, beautiful oriental cork art in the booths, made to order hibachi station, as well as a sushi station where one can often watch them prepare sushi.  They charge 1-2 dollars more than the average Chinese buffets, but the price can be justified due to the cleanliness and freshness..I guess.  The employees are very attentive so plates won&#39;t stack up and glasses will quickly be refilled.  I write this to you while resting between food rounds.

The lot was full and pretty busy inside.  I havent been back since it was the old One Buffet location but it&#39;s the same owner new name and same great food, the owner was very friendly as well. Cost $9 for lunch and i think a sodas $2 more. You can get the fresh cooked hibachi, standard asian buffet selections, salad bar, dessert, and even sushi. They used to have more rolls when it was One Buffet. Crab Rangoon is my favorite item and theirs are stuffed full! I was told they even do crab legs on the weekends.

For my first round of food, I got General Tso&#39;s, orange chicken, spicy beef and, chicken, and friend rice. It was pretty average tasting, perhaps it would be better if I went earlier in the day.

For the second round I decided to go with the hibachi grill, got seafood and steak, along with vegetables, and some thin noodles. All was made under 5 minutes and you get the choice of picking a few good sauces. I recommend the classic hibachi and the spicy red sauce.

Service was pretty good for a buffet drinks were refilled and dishes cleaned up constantly."

If you go right around noon and a half hour before the dinner shift, you have the best chance of getting the freshest stuff. It&#39;s a comforting sight to see steaming trays at a buffet, although that&#39;s not always the norm here. Their chicken wings always seem dry and overdone, but I love their black pepper chicken especially when you can tell they just brought it out. Like any buffet, you&#39;ll find out right away what you do and don&#39;t like. Their hibachi station is a great way to make your own lo mein dish if you&#39;re catching the general buffet on its &#34;off hours&#34;.

When I put my napkin over it because I just couldn&#39;t stomach it, the person who works there took my plate lifted my napkin, looked at the food and shook his head.

First of all, all the mail in coupons I get from them are only for pick up and delivery. I don&#39;t get that! Normally it is the opposite because restaurants make money off the drinks and tips!!!! But I was like ok... whatever...

So then they have a coupon on yelp. Check in and get a free 12 in cheese pizza with the purchase of a 16&#34; one topping pizza. Since you are checking in I am assuming that means you are eating in the restaurant and there was no mention that the yelp coupon wasn&#39;t valid in the dining room. But to no surprise... It was not valid!!! That is false advertising. The yelp coupon states nothing about having to do pick up or delivery. 

Overall, this is one of my favorite pizza places in my area and my server was really nice, so I did not want to throw a fit about the coupons. I&#39;m just overall upset by how stingy management is. The dining room wasn&#39;t even crowded. You would think they would want people to use their coupons to give them more business in their dining room area. 

I was also annoyed by the fact that they would not allow us to preorder our pizza for dine in before we came. Who cares? It&#39;s not that complicated. 

Sorry prontos, I love your pizza, but your stinginess, gives you 2 stars in my book."

The thin crust pizzas are delicious.  Decided to try their other food that my coworkers will sometimes pick up for a lazy Saturday delivery.  If you order from Grubhub, be aware that they don&#39;t seem to use the tracker thing and the tracker could be wrong. It told 1.5 hours, but they were here in 45 minutes.

It&#39;s pretty meh on the rest of their food.
The fried mushrooms are pretty good and a nice sized portion for 2-3 people as an appetizer. They&#39;re served with a ranch that I think is a bit thin, but still tastes like ranch, so...
Garlic Bread with Cheese is exactly as it sounds. It&#39;s your standard garlic bread covered in cheese.  I was not given any marinara for dipping; I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s purposeful or a mistake.

For my &#34;entree&#34;, I got Tortellini Al Forno. Based on the description, cheese tortellinis in a red sauce with more cheese.  Sounds a-okay to me! Like everyone else, the bread they serve with the pasta is pathetic. It&#39;s not even the size of my palm. Their tortellinis are pretty big but...I can&#39;t taste the cheese? At all? I see it. But I don&#39;t taste it. :| Their marinara sauce it&#39;s served in is ridiculously watery.

I&#39;d recommend them for pizzas and mushrooms, but I can&#39;t recommend their pastas after this flavorless, watery mess. It&#39;s kinda odd considering the pizzas have actually a pretty nice flavorful marinara."

They appeared in Bloomongdale roughly around the same time as my arrival from NYC.  For me their attraction was the thin crust pizza.   In a land of deep dish, their thin crust was phenomenal.  Later I started grabbing my wraps and salads there too, because the price was very competitive and the quality was heads above the corporate chains.  Now they have a new location, a real dining room and a real bar.  Staff is first rate, showing the commitment to quality and a strong connection to the local community.

They hired architects and designers to fully remodel this former diner, and you can tell. The place looks great. The draw to Pronto&#39;s is still the specialty pizzas. The Blackened chicken pizza has an incredible &#34;creamy roasted red pepper sauce&#34;.  An 18&#34; XL blackened chicken (or Buffalo chicken) pizza will run you $35, and feeds 5 people.  Dining solo? Try the blackened chicken sandwich! With full bar, this is an excellent date spot. They are typically not crowded even during weekday lunch rush.  Pronto&#39;s knows what they&#39;re doing. It&#39;s a matter of time before the word gets out about this gem."

Just returned from there with a lunch take-out order. Was excited to have a  place near my work for take out. My order was ready  for  me at the time they stated. My excitement was short lived though after tasting the calamari.

The lemons and sauce were packed in with the calamari. The sauce (bland marinara?) spilled over half of the dish which  was unfortunate because the sauce wasn&#39;t that  good and I prefer tabasco. The lemons had lost all their juice probably  from the heat of the dish. The calamari was soggy but not overcooked.

All in all I think my $9 would have better spent elsewhere. I may give their pizza a try in the near future since it is close to work. I will update at that time"

Obviously Pronto&#39;s is known in town for their fabulous pizza, so I was anxious to try their new full service restaurant and was not disappointed.  The decor is clean, fresh and modern.  The full service bar is inviting along with the staff, they were all very personable that contributed to the fun atmosphere.

I regularly order their margarita pizza and bruschetta for delivery. This was my first time eating in. The service was great. No complaints there at all. Friendly. Quick. Refills as soon as they were needed.

My biggest complaint is that the restaurant was very loud. I don&#39;t know if this is normal but we couldn&#39;t really talk. We could hear the TVs from the bar as well as an almost constant murmur from the bar area. We could hear other people&#39;s conversations from across the restaurant.

Basically you end up with a piece of cardboard loaded with toppings which is pretty tasteless. Then add the premium price and you up feeling a bit robbed. Lou&#39;s is cheaper and much better quality. If you want the same experience with a cheaper price you can probably find an aldi brand pizza that will equal or surpass this crap.

If it&#39;s going to take that long just tell me that! Our pizza was luke warm. The calamari was chewy and disgusting and the mushrooms were cold...no warmth whatsoever. This was a $45 meal with tip.

You would totally miss it if you were driving along and not actively looking for it.   I received a flyer in the mail and thought I&#39;d give them a try.   I&#39;ve ordered food from Prontos a few times since and overall the food is good.    The pizza is somewhat pricey and I wish they would put a foil on the bottom so leftovers don&#39;t stick to the box but it is tasty.    Lou&#39;s still is tops for me but Prontos is a good occasional pizza substitute.   I ordered their &#34;jumbo wings&#34; once which were far from what I would define as jumbo.    But they were good.    Delivery times are also fairly reasonable.   They tend to overestimate that time which gives you a nice feeling when they actually exceed expectations.

We have been getting their pizza (take out) off and on for years. They seem like good people, and the pizza is usually very good. Now they moved to a full restaurant location just a couple blocks South of their previous location. My family of 4 decided to give the restaurant a try. My 2 teenagers got a pepperoni pizza. It was very good. (Although we thought it was odd that they told us we just got the last of the pepperoni. How does a pizza place run out of pepperoni?) My husband got the veal parmesan. The veal was average, but the pasta was just ok. I got the mushroom florentine pasta, which was very disappointing. It was swimming in water- from the mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes, all potentially watery, but it was disappointing that they didn&#39;t drain it better. So it felt like I was eating pasta and cheese soup. I asked for a bowl to pour the water away from the pasta, and the waiter offered to pay for my beer as a consolation. I appreciated the effort, but remained disappointed with the pasta. Neither of our 2 pasta meals included bread. Seems strange to eat a pasta meal with no side of bread. Finally, a few days later, my son and I were in the mood for a steak sandwich. We each tried the French Onion Steak Sandwich- to go. The price was a bit high ($12.95) but would be worth it in some cases. The sandwich had good flavor, but was awfully small. No sides came with it. If fries came with it, I would felt like the price was a bit more appropriate. I felt like it wasn&#39;t worth the price. A little &#34;value-added&#34; would make this a much better restaurant."

The bar person said she would take our order as she was doing a little of both that night. We were not sitting in the bar but the restaurant...however it made no difference to us who took our order as long as they were pleasant and provided good service. She was pleasant but in a hurry.


We ordered a salad and thin crust pizza with sausage, and onions. The server brings us 3 small slices of bread.......three? How about splurging and serving a little more. You got more bread in the Viking days when your ready to meet your fate. (did you see the chunk of bread they gave to the guy on Black Sails)? 

The salad was one of the worst I ever had. It had so many different LARGE pieces of several types of greens that that had seen a better day.  It appeared they had been on the beach in Miami soaking up the sun far too long. The greens were sooooooooo limp...a few onions, maybe a small slice of tomato, and a cucumber. I can&#39;t remember what what else was in it like maybe croutons because it was such a disaster. 

The pizza:  The crust was thin but not crispy all the way through. Once you bite past the very edge of the pizza, the dough was gummy in the middle. Too much cheese, not enough sauce. What sauce was on it had no taste. The  Sausage was bland.  Now here is the kicker...when you took a bite of the pizza, EVERYTHING came off the top of the crust. You have a mouthful of all the toppings in one piece hanging off your lips....... Who wants to eat pizza like this?

Sorry guys I really wanted to like you. The best pizza we have encountered thus far, is Village Pizza on Randall Road. Elgin.  Next to Burnt Toast Resturant. ( I am not sure if they are even Italian)  Best thin crust around. Sauce is just the right amount and flavorful. They could improve on their sausage for our liking. Needs a little more spices.

I have ordered a large pizza for takeout. Over the phone, when I was making my order, the mistress who was taking the order was giving the attitude just to get me off the phone quickly. When I showed up to pickup the order, her and another colleague were in a mood &#34;what do you want?&#34;. I took the pizza home and when I opened the box, the very first thing I noticed was that it wasn&#39;t cut all the way through. Luckily, I have a pizza cutter. The next thing I noticed was that the pizza falling apart. &#34;How you mean falling apart?&#34;, that&#39;s what you are probably thinking. Well, when you take the slice and take a bite, all the toppings are sliding and you end up holding the crust in your hands. Cheese that they are using is a very low quality and it makes eating and chewing even easier. The crust was definitely frozen, not fresh. 
I know that the opinions vary among people, but this was just my experience and I felt that I wanted to share it, just for the people that like me are not a fans of overtopped thin crust pizzas, because if I was a fan I would just order a deep dish."

I got a thick crust (and by thick I mean at least 3/4&#39;&#39; thick!) half and half pizza: half BBQ sauce and bbq chicken, half marinara sauce with pepperoni and green peppers and it was DELICIOUS!  The pizza was ready for pickup on time, super hot, and cooked to perfection.  Not too much cheese or too much sauce - and it was so big it was bursting out of the box!

Another bonus: Pronto&#39;s has breadsticks!  They are slightly crisped - like they spent a second in the deep fryer - and they are incredibly delicious!  They&#39;re big, but you only get 3 so order multiple orders of breadsticks if you need more than just 3. 

I&#39;m only in Bloomingdale a week or two a year, but I&#39;ll be dreaming of Pronto&#39;s until I come back.

Wow, this was a great stumble upon pizza place for me. I don&#39;t usually order pizza and if I do it&#39;s usually 1. Another person picking the place for me. 2. Deep dish so we stick to staples like Nancy&#39;s and Lou Malnati&#39;s out here in the &#39;burbs.

I remember my father ordering a thin crust pizza from a small business that wrapped their pizza in bags instead of boxes. I forgot the name so using my trusty yelp, I tried to find out the place. Pronto&#39;s was nearby and had a ton of great reviews. I thought that this had to be the place... I was wrong, but never in my life was I so happy that I was.

I ordered a thin crust and upon recommendation of yelper angelica r., I decided to order the calamari. Calamari from a pizza joint? I could only shudder to think of a pizza joint like Jan&#39;s Pizza having calamari on their menu. Being a calamari snob, I have to say that Pronto&#39;s does a really really nice job!

Yeah, yeah, yeah enough about calamari - more about the pizza! The thin crust was definitely delicious. It&#39;s not as doughy as other places and doesn&#39;t bleed out with grease despite it containing 2 different types of meats. I don&#39;t think I order pizza frequently enough to adventurously try their signature pizzas, let alone the bbq pizzas. Still, this place is definitely a good place to grab a thin crust."

While it wasn&#39;t the best pizza I have had in the area it was good for the usual $4 slice with a pop.

I could tell that they had added the pepperoni to the slice right before they reheated it. It didn&#39;t have all the good hot oil that cooks into the pizza when you order it with pepperoni. Other than that the sauce was nice but it almost had too much cheese on it. I know that is almost an oxymoron but it wasn&#39;t hot enough so it had that half solidified taste to it that isn&#39;t too appealing. On the plus side it was a huge slice and since it was thick crust it help up to the crazy amount of cheese.

Overall good but not great slice. Ill keep on looking and probably try their thin crust - its supposed to be better."

Prices not same on several menus for same thing. The &#34;antipronto&#34; salad is a joke and a rip off. There was one tiny piece of roasted veg, remainder is green stuff, tough, old. Supposed to have balsamic dressing and include bread but had neither. For all of that I got to pay $20 for carry out. MANY places have spaghetti, sausage or meatballs, salad (WITH dressing) and bread for much less. I won&#39;t be in a hurry to try again. This is a carry out place but has 2 tables where people can wait or where a few people can eat. No air conditioning, very HOT. Why are there good reviews?!"

While it wasn&#39;t the best pizza I have had in the area it was good for the usual $4 slice with a pop.

I could tell that they had added the pepperoni to the slice right before they reheated it. It didn&#39;t have all the good hot oil that cooks into the pizza when you order it with pepperoni. Other than that the sauce was nice but it almost had too much cheese on it. I know that is almost an oxymoron but it wasn&#39;t hot enough so it had that half solidified taste to it that isn&#39;t too appealing. On the plus side it was a huge slice and since it was thick crust it help up to the crazy amount of cheese.

Overall good but not great slice. Ill keep on looking and probably try their thin crust - its supposed to be better."

We finally decided to go ahead and use it for dinner on friday night. Thinking we were going to an Itialian sit down we all jumped in the car and headed to Pronto&#39;s. We were a bit surprised when we got there that it was more of a Carry out then a sit down place. It was a nice night out though so we decided to have dinner at the table that he had setup outside. I&#39;m glad we stayed. The service here was the best I have had in a long time. Everyone that works at Pronto&#39;s is happy and was extremly friendly. We were served by the owner and he really knows his food. My boyfriend wanted a vodka sauce on his pasta, and the owner made the suggestion that he get a piece of uncut sausage to go with it. For dinner I had the cheese pizza. The food here is great. Everything is made fresh. I really enjoyed my pizza it was served hot and the crust was perfectly crispy. Over all a great place in the bloomingdale area. Only down side is seating is limited, so if you go here best to carry out or have your food delivered."

They consistently deliver their pizzas hot and on time (as they should be), and use fresh ingredients, such as fresh mushrooms (not canned, like many pizza places do). We have had their thin crust and stuffed, and both are terrific. I love the mix of cheeses and the flavor of the sauce. They also have delicious catered Italian food.

I especially love the escargots appetizer, which is   baked snails in their special brown Thai curry sauce and sweet basil leaves, served with grilled garlic bread on the side.    I have had the honor of introducing this to many newbies and first timers, who were simply amazed. All of the entrees tried over perhaps a dozen visits have been outstanding, notably: Cashew chicken, Five Star Chicken, Nutty Chicken, Pepper Steak, Basil Fried Rice, Pad Kee Mao (my personal favorite) and Crab Fried Rice. Desserts are unusual and very pretty looking. Surprisingly they are have some interesting martini creations too. Highly recommended and if ever int he area - this is a no-brainer."

We got our entrees first. Then we asked about the appetizer which came about 10 minutes later. ????  We were told the chef had to work on the appetizer and that&#39;s why it was late. I didn&#39;t get that.

I really didn&#39;t find anything great about the food and neither did my dining partner. The service was spotty as they had the server handling the carry out orders as well.

From the outside, this place is nothing special and barely noticeable. I think this is what also makes this place great. You walk in, the ambiance is cozy and chic. It&#39;s not too big but not too small. My friend and I were promptly seated and offered drinks. Our waitress was awesome and funny. 

I ordered two things I don&#39;t quite remember the names of (see pictures) but I was so impressed by the portion and the quality. Even though there was larger portions, they don&#39;t skimp on the veggies or meat. It&#39;s loaded with deliciousness! Oh, and just like everyone says, the avacado rolls are to die for.

Have only had take out but every time it has been stellar. Pad Woon Sen has the most flavorful sauce I have ever had with that dish anywhere, I love it!!! The basil fried rice has a nice peppery bite but is balanced by the savory flavors cooked into the rice. My wife ordered the pepper steak tonight and I tried it and it was quite honestly the best pepper steak I have ever had. I love Thai food, this place takes Thai food and elevates the flavor beyond what I have had in recent years. Also the avocado roll appetizer is also amazing. The crunchiness of the fried roll gives way to a burst of deliciousness!!! I was highly impressed by those. From all I have tried here I would say the theme that comes across is balance. In all their dishes, not one flavor overpowers another, they just meld together and are bright enough to complement one another without stealing the show. Seriously impressed! Their TomYom soup is also phenomenal. I ordered it extra spicy the last time I had a head cold and again the flavors were perfect together and pronounced enough I could still taste it despite my cold.

The restaurant we initially intended on eating at was closing soon, so we yelped it up &amp; found Montri Thai.

Located in a large strip mall in Winfield, IL it looks pretty simple on the outside. Once you get inside, however, it almost feels like you are at a restaurant near a tourist spot with soft music playing in the background.

We went on a Friday evening around 8:30pm, and the restaurant was on the empty side. We were seated promptly and given menus to look over.

I almost always order the Pad Kee Mao (spicy flat rice noodles) when I first visit a Thai spot. My husband ordered a curry dish (Coconut Yellow Curry?). My food overall was pretty decent. A little greasy for my taste, but definitely not overly oily to the point where I can&#39;t enjoy my food. The curry dish was delicious!

Our server was friendly and pleasant which enhanced our experience a bit more.

Would love to go back and try something more adventurous like curry or something different.  

So far, so good."

And I supposed you can&#39;t please everyone&#39;s taste buds and unfortunately, my taste buds were not a fan.  Everything else was great, and I would certainly come back to try other dishes.  The décor is modern and nice.  The service is fast and friendly.  The owner even came over at the end of our meal to ask how everything was and solicit any feedback we may have.  He also mentioned that they will have a live Jazz band one Friday a month starting in a couple of months.

Thai Iceed Tea $3 - This was very good, not too sweet at all (in fact, I could go a tad sweeter).

Tom Kha Kai $5 - Thai coconut milk soup with your choice of chicken or vegetable cooked with lemongrass, bell pepper, mushroom and lime leave.  This was a tasty soup, but what threw me off were the pieces of green bell peppers.  I love veggies, but this is one of my least favorite vegetables.  I&#39;ve never had that in a Tom Kha before.

Lard Nar with Tofu $9 - Big flat rice noodle with Broccoli and Collard Greens in garlic gravy.  They made this with a very strange twist - the noodles were crispy and the sauce was watery.  Maybe this is the fusion part.  I was expecting the normal soft wide rice noodles with thick sauce and didn&#39;t particularly enjoy this variation.  Also, I didn&#39;t see any collard greens.

Spicy Catfish $14 - Deep fried crispy catfish with red curry paste in coconut milk, topped with a touch of crispy basil leave.  My favorite dish of the night and it was delicious.

There were plenty of food, which we took home as leftovers.  I was particularly touched that even though we only had a tablespoonful of rice left, they had packed us more rice to go with our leftovers."

Finally, great Thai close to home! I have been dying for some great Thai food ever since I ate at Banana Leaf in Dallas and remembered just how great Thai food could be. (amazingly the owner there looked Thai, but had a thick Cajun accent)

Seriously, we eat Thai food a couple of times a month and have been making do with food that is just OK and creeping up in price. Many of these Thai places don&#39;t even serve much seafood... What&#39;s up with that?

Montri Thai has a full menu with all the right stuff. We started with the Avocado rolls and Chicken Satay... followed by Pad See Ew with Beef, Tofu Thai Fried Rice, Thai Orange Chicken and Panang Curry.

Everything was delicious! The Panang Curry is a real treat and the Satay is the best that I&#39;ve had in a long time (looking forward to trying the pork satay) I can&#39;t wait to get back there to try the whole red snapper and some of the other seafood dishes.

Now there is more to eat in Warrenville than just Two Brothers.

Good prices, a nice room, decent wine list, friendly service and great food... an awesome formula for success. Now if only they could work on their Cajun accents"

The portion I was served felt endless, and there were plenty of perfectly cooked shrimp.  I asked for &#34;spicy,&#34; and my dish absolutely was spicy without blowing my head off.  But don&#39;t eat those little red chilies in the dish, because those will make your mouth hurt.  I mistook them for a dried fruit, but I have no idea why I assumed something so ridiculous, so my mouth suffered a little.

The avocado rolls were interesting.  I liked the creaminess of the avocado and the crunchiness of the roll.  But it kind of tasted like guacamole which threw off the whole Thai thing.  Our friends ordered the Angel Wings appetizer, which looked like a giant stuffed chicken leg and deep fried.  I didn&#39;t get to try it, but it looked delicious.

There&#39;s a good variety of Thai dishes on the menu aside from the predictable Pad Thai including red, yellow, and green curries, and quite frankly a lot of other things I cannot recall much less pronounce (Pad See Ew, Kung...tingtangwallawallabingbang...)

Montri Thai is located in a strip mall, alongside a laundromat and thrift store, so I expected a more divey, casual joint.  While Montri Thai is casual, the interior of the restaurant felt intimate and classy with the dark wood tables, booths, and white tablecloths.  The restaurant can definitely accomodate groups, but it was so quiet in here (aside from the Christmas music) that I felt like I had to keep my voice down.

Good Thai food especially if you are looking for something a bit more upscale than the divey take-out joints."

However, I was so disappointed with the food and service here. I ordered Tom yum and pad see Wei. Unlike all the Tom yum I tasted before, it is too sweet and not really spicy. My husband ordered Panang curry, and this is the only dish he eat every time when we go to a Thai restaurant, but it is too salty.

Hands down, this is it. Whether it&#39;s break ups, work stress, or something else, their cocktails are excellent (both in liquor content and price) and their Rama Chicken makes everything temporarily better. The Rama Tofu isn&#39;t bad either. It&#39;s large enough that if you pick at your food and have a liquid dinner when stressed, the food still tastes good microwaved the next day.

It&#39;s true, hardly anybody dines in. Which makes it perfect to talk to the servers. My favorite is on maternity leave but I&#39;ve since become Facebook friends with her. Yes, this place is that amazing.

Taste was pretty good. The duck was fried and some was hard to eat since the breading or whatnot was extremely tough. 

The prices are about average for dinner and not too expensive. I think my appetizzer was around $6 and my entree was around $18.

Service was fine with no issues.

What I know is, whatever food I tried was good so I&#39;m going to give Montri the benefit of the doubt here.  Really the two major issues were that the service was really slow.  We waited a LONG time just to get our appetizers like avocado rolls and soup.  That was excessive, but again maybe the issue was the size of our group, 8 adults and 6 kids.  The other issue my friends complained about was the sweetness of the food.  Many entrees came out quite sweet, which wasn&#39;t ideal.

I tried a couple of things.  First off, the avocado rolls were great.  Almost like a Tex/Mex-Asian fusion thing going on.  Really nice.  On the other hand, the Tom Kha soup was... not what I expected.  Not that it was bad, but it just didn&#39;t taste like the Tom Kha soup I have almost everywhere else.  I&#39;m all for unique flavors, but this just seemed like a whole different kind of soup.  Really, the soup was my only complaint.  The red curry was great and the Pad Kee Mao was good.  I think we could and should have upped the spice levels on everything we ordered.  Adding in the hot sauce provided the heat we needed.

I would recommend Montri.  I would come back and give them another shot in terms of the service assuming part of the issues were just due to our group size.  We&#39;ll hope for a better experience next time."

We arrived hoping to finish dinner by the closing time we thought was 9 (actually 10) on a Friday.  The place wasn&#39;t too full, but the decor and setup is very clean and modern while still being comfy.  We took a bit of extra time to order since we wanted to scan the whole menu to see what they had to offer, and the waitress was extremely polite and not bugging us, but attentive none the less.

We ordered some Thai Tea that really stuck to your gums.  The very good flavor hung around in your mouth if you let it.  Then we decided on some Tom Kha Kai which came in a plenty large enough bowl to share (but not too large as to leave you groaning).  The flavor was very good but there was an interesting aspect - bell peppers.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but it was unfamiliar for the dish (as well as a couple of others).  Probably just something to get used to.

We also had the Pad See Eiw which was delicious, but the noodles may have been fried too much (unless they started with a different wide noodle than I&#39;m used to) as they were a bit too hard to cut with a fork and or spoon.  We commented to the waiter and he said he would tell the chef and thanked us for our opinion.  The dish also had broccoli instead of collard greens, but the flavor was great either way.

The other dish we ordered was the spicy catfish.  It was a very good mixture of red curry and coconut milk with a spice that I thought I was going to need to spice up at first, but set in to the perfect cruise to spice town.

When the waiter went to wrap up our food he noticed that we did not have much rice and, without asking, packed a nice, full extra container for us to take.  Awesome!


I really liked the lounge-style oldies that were playing the whole time we were there (Beatles, Doors, Steely Dan, etc) and the waiter also noted that they will be featuring live jazz once a month (2nd Friday?) and possibly more often if it is popular.  Cool stuff!"

Real Thai food uses fish sauce. Especially in pad Thai and fried rice. I don&#39;t understand Thai restaurants owned by Thai people that have lousy food, especially to a culture where food is so important. This did not have that Thai flavor. Crab Rangoon (which isn&#39;t Thai but who cares) was ok. I normally get joy Yees but they are temporarily closed. I will not order from here again. If you&#39;re reading this and are Thai, the food is &#34;juhd cheep-hai&#34;! Which in Thai means bland as hell. Skip it"

For our entrees we had the panang curry with chicken and tofu and the green curry with chicken. Both were flavorful and delicious!! Some of the best I&#39;ve had in the Chicagoland area. The green curry was creamy coconutty goodness with thinly sliced bamboo shoots, peas, and peppers. Both dishes also had just the right amount of heat to balance out the sweet and creamy.

We visited Reserve 22, at Village Links, on a Fri nite in May &#39;15. The place was already very busy at 7, not so much with golfers coming off the links, but with diners who made &#34;22&#34; their target for the evening. A loud boisterous crowd filled the dining room, the large bar, and most of the terrace. Video screens covered sports of the day.

Service was very attentive, and there was plenty of staff to handle the large crowd as well as keep problems down and service up.

&#34;22&#34; is not the usual clubhouse dining. A long list of craft and specialty beers, and wines, are offered. They do have typical soup/salad/sandwich menus, but also an interesting list of small plates and sides, from $3 to about $15. A limited list of plate dinners ran mostly below $20. We had chicken linguini w/artichokes and bistro steak w/truffle/parmigiana fries. The steak was no filet but was well prepared and nicely dressed with a savory, slightly tangy sauce. The fries were to die for! I devoured the whole mountain of them. The chicken pasta, a large serving, was very good and included several dried tomato slices. Sides are extra.

The noisy crowd diminished about 9PM and management went to great efforts to move the band, and pull out some tables, for those who stayed for the entertainment and dancing until 11.

While not gourmet dining (3*), and the noise is not our thing, prices are modest,  the food offerings are creative, the mood is up-beat, and service very attentive (management gets a 5*). A good value and fun place. Res. recommended."

It started first with us walking in...and not be acknowledged. no sign saying to seat yourself, or wait to be seated. We had to go and find someone to ask.

Ive tried all the red curries and two months ago I got seafood the seafood panang, never trying anything else again - its a winner!  its always take-out for us."

Nestled off Rt. 59 in a strip mall, we walked past it going to the hardware store and decided to give it a try. My husband is gluten and dairy free, so I sold him on the rice noodles and peanut oil in Thai food.

We have been back twice and loved everything we have tried. I adore the mango lobster roll appetizers, which are spring rolls with a peanut sauce you can spoon on yourself. I&#39;ve had the baby corn and peapod and trio delight entrees and they were both delicious. My partner had pad thai chicken and some kind of coconut curry with shrimp and pineapple that he raved about. The Jasmine iced tea is refreshing and light, too.

The banana dessert reminded me of overcooked oatmeal, but there is so much delicious food, I can skip dessert. :) I will definitely be going back often and we noticed they do a brisk carryout business, so we are looking forward to having a new carryout place that is on my way home from work."

At any rate, we went in to dine. Yelp, I hate to be the dissenter but I fear that I must say that Montri is carrying on Ariya&#39;s mediocre tradition.

Why? Due to pretty much everything we ordered. For an appetizer we split the Blue Sea Crispy Rolls. For a dish that claimed to contain a combo of lobster, crab, shrimp, and scallop along with carrot, cabbage and bean threads, I have to say that the seafood was almost undetectable. The taste wasn&#39;t bad for what it was, but what it was was pretty much a deep-fried veggie roll. 

For our entrees he ordered the sweet almond beef and I got the mussaman curry with chicken. Mine came in a large ceramic cauldron, a heady broth of coconut milk bobbing with potatoes and chunks of pineapple; I fished around with the serving spoon to locate the chicken I&#39;d ordered until we realized that it had been made with tofu. 

(Servers: this is what an ordering pad is for!! There is no shame in using one!!)

I snared the waitress before she got into the back, and she took it away and apparently they remade the whole dish, because my friend finished his whole meal before mine came back. It ended up being okay, but in the end I should have tried something else initially (had I known). 

His dish was alright but as he said, only serviceable. 

There were a number of interesting sounding dishes on the menu (nutty chicken, coco chicken) and a plethora of seafood dishes (including the hilariously named (Hotty Seafood), but after this experience I&#39;ll return to the safety of Le Siam further south on 59."

Montri has yet to dissapoint. I do go at lunch a lot and the 5 star dish is wonderful. I recently went back and tried the spicy basil chicken- WOW. Excellent job! The starter egg drop soup was much different than expected and was delicious.
I really appreciate a restaurant that makes things fresh and care about what they serve. Montri is small and quaint and makes it&#39;s food a nice presentation which I appreciate, and you can taste the freshness. Try it, you&#39;ll like it.

Called in a pick-up order and was bringing food back to some friends who own a nearby business. Upon arriving, I liked the interior and the people were friendly, but when I got the food back, I was shocked to see what was being portrayed as thai food. Got a few noodle dishes and a bunch of apps. NONE was good and none was remotely close to authentic. One step up from food court sweet and sour chicken at the mall really. Ask for spicy, and you get a 1/2 cup of red pepper flakes thrown in at the end type of crap - and the crazy thing is that people like this junk. Needness to say, I&#39;m still looking for the elusive (and even edible) suburban thai food."

The menu selection was extensive (not just your typical pad thai etc.)

The mango lobster roll appetizers were great but keep in mind they are spring rolls.  For some reason I was anticipating something more like an egg roll but that was my own fault for not reading the description well enough.  

The food had good flavor and the ingredients tasted fresh.

Restaurant itself is clean and decorated nicely."

(I normally go to Tusk Thai in Batavia) So I work in Warrenville and came across this place online when searching for a nearby Thai restaurant. I stuck to what I know best which is why I ordered Thai fried rice with chicken. The chicken was very flavorful and delicious! Definitely exceeded my expectations! Now the rice on the other hand didn&#39;t. I&#39;m not sure what ingredient they used too much of but the taste reminded me a lot of the $1 Michelina&#39;s boxed frozen fried rice which I do not like. Price for my order was about $10 and it was a good size portion if only I had liked the flavor more. I just admit I was a tad bit disappointed that it was not as good as my favorite Thai restaurant.

This is a Thai restaurant and all Thai flavor sucks. I decided to give a shot because of the reviews but I was so mad with every single dish. It is the worst Thai restaurant ever. They can even cook a simple curry normally! Even the Tom yum soap! Do you think people don&#39;t know Thai food! You can buy the Thai curry from a Asian supermarket it is way much better than this! When I walked into the restaurant I&#39;m glad  because the waitress are Thai people but when I eat I got so confused. WHAT THE HL is dat! I have been Thailand and I eat a lot Thai food in U.S. But this is so bad can you Thai guys try yourself? HOW you can sell this and it is not cheap. At least you guys should give some real Thai rice because it is famous and normal in Thai food; HOWEVER! The rice is so sticky and slagging I&#39;m sure it is the same rice like super cheap Asian fast food rice. Well, anyone who give 5 stars I hope you guys enjoy. Im would be glad my review could help someone or maybe just one person who gonna try this restaurant. If you think I&#39;m wrong go Assi market or Amazone to get the can curry, drop some beef, bell pepper, and coco milk, then try their curry . You will see."

I&#39;m still impressed. I do think next time we&#39;ll dine in. Tastes much better without the car ride. Nothing beats hot out of the kitchen crab rangoons.

We had the avocado rolls again. I think that is my favorite thing here!
The rangoons were good again.

I tried the chicken satay, and it was good, but again, not my thing. Just the flavoring of it wasn&#39;t to my liking. But it&#39;s good. Again, I hope this makes sense. Just because I didn&#39;t like it doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t. All I could taste was the marinade, not the chicken. not how I like it. It was heavily flavored. There&#39;s the word I want. the peanut sauce that goes with was pretty tasty.

Hubby had the tom kha. He was happy with it. And now he has satay for lunch. 

Our order was ready in a timely manner. And it tasted good. :) I&#39;m a happy customer. And I&#39;m full.

The chicken satay was more chicken than usual Thai places...I loved it had more meat but my wife thought Le Siams was tastier. The garlic chicken and shrimp fried rice were very tasty as well.

Time of my visit: Early dinner

This was my first time at Muscle Maker Grill...  I should note, I did not realize that it was a chain until after I started writing this review.  However, I will make an exception, because of the uniqueness of the chain (it&#39;s mostly located on the east coast NY/NJ area).

Off to the experience, I paced my order for pickup.  It was easy to place it, however, we wanted Warrior Nachos, but sadly they were out of chips/nachos.  I ordered Premier Burger and my girlfriend ordered Penne Romano.  When I arrived the order was ready.  I liked that!

I was a bit surprised by the portions, I guess being too long in this country, I got used to large portions.  The portion was probably right size.  My total was $17 and change, which was a bit pricey, even for this area.

Off to our food.  I could not speak to my girlfriend&#39;s food as she only let me try a little bit, but I would say, I was a bit disappointed...  The side I chose was cucumber salad.  The salad was decent, it was well seasoned.  The burger was interesting...  It seemed that the topics and the cheese over powered the taste of the meat.  The bun was good.

I would give this place a C-.  For the price I was expecting more value for the price.  Service was very good!  I would like to come back and try Warrior Nachos."

I was excited when I found this place offering tons of high protein/low carb options, plus nutrition information that&#39;s posted online. I ended up being pretty disappointed with my meal... I ordered the turkey taco salad, no cheese, and sour cream on the side. The turkey was broken up so fine it was almost like a meat sauce on top of lettuce, and it was lukewarm. The salsa that came on it was like jar salsa. It tasted like there was a lot of sodium in it too (and verified by their online nutrition facts). It was far from wow-ing me, that&#39;s for sure. There are healthier, more flavorful ways to punch up ground turkey to make it fantastic, and sadly, I was wishing for my own cooking as I ate this. I was only able to eat half, and the rest will be in the trash shortly. My guy got their chicken entree dinner- a grilled chicken breast, potato and steamed broccoli. Everything came out piping hot, but we never saw a piece of chicken go on their grill. He said even though the potato was steaming the entire time, it didn&#39;t taste hot, which was strange. He suspected some microwave action in play.

The only saving grace was the staff who made sure we had a clean table to sit at, fresh cups for water, and checked on us once while eating. This place has potential, but we were far from impressed and won&#39;t be back."

Since I work in Wheaton, I thought this might be a good place to grab a healthy lunch from.  Yes, I was right.  My first visit here was after a boxing class at the gym, I just wanted a protein shake...they have em! They taste great and are of decent size for the cost, and most importantly, convenient.  
The night I stopped in to pick up a shake, the woman asked me if I wanted food to go along with it, and I said no, because that was big enough for a meal, plus I watch my carb intake.  She pointed out their low carb options which brought me back here last week for lunch. I called ahead for the &#34;Texas&#34; one of their low carb solutions.  It was just perfect (and filling) for lunch.  It was still hot when I brought it back from work, plus the container is great for food prepping at home.  

This place is also a heaven sent as I&#39;m currently participating in a weight loss challenge at my gym.  I will continue to stop in at this place.  All of their nutrition information is posted online... all healthy stuff!!!!

You see, I&#39;ve always carried around a bit of extra weight since late childhood, but I have taken steps to combat that, to get rid of bad eating habits, and to stay physically active. And so Muscle Maker Grill helps make Review 200, and it helps me in my quest for 200, because they offer well-portioned and well-PROportioned meals. You want high protein/low-carb? Balanced lean protein, veggie, and starch? Veggie options? It&#39;s all there. You can tell certain food items come pre-cooked, or pre-prepared in some fashion. But the price is right, and at the end of the day, someone else is doing all the food prep for you! Most meals can be split into two sensibly sized portions. Eat half now, save the rest for later.

If you&#39;re reeeeeeally not into the whole cooking/meal prep thing, they also offer meal plans that run about $7 per meal, with no weekly commitment whatsoever. I also get a 10% discount thanks to my association with the Cardinal Fitness in Glen Ellyn. With mostly healthy, and mostly guilt-free options, there&#39;s a little room to feel like you&#39;re cheating, but also plenty to make sure you stay true to your nutritional goals.

This is our go-to place if we don&#39;t feel like cooking during the week and want something healthier, guilt-free, but tasty!"

They have a nice selection that is healthier than 95% of the other offerings around town.  I had a chicken breast that was served over steamed broccoli, what a treat instead of fries.  Lots of different choices, good food, hot, cooked fresh. 
On the flip side, I have had the chicken breast sandwich and it was pretty small, about the same size bun as a Mcdonalds regular burger, and the smallest chicken breast I have seen. I think it was $9, and that came with a side. Was a little underwhelmed.
I had the godfather last time, which the menu lists as Griled chicken and Portabella mushrooms. Since I love the earthy taste of portabellas, I tried it.  Well, the vast majority of mushrooms on my dish were regular button mushrooms.  The person at the counter said they mix up both kinds.  So why doesn&#39;t it say Portabella and Button mushrooms?  If I saw an offering that said &#34;Kobe beef burger&#34;, I would expect 100% Kobe beef, not a mixture of 90% ground chuck, and 10% Kobe, right? I felt like I was a little mislead, and that makes me wonder what else is &#34;mixed&#34; on the menu."

All four of my meals including the one I ate there totaled in $35 not including tax. I have been wanting to come here for awhile since I know others that already do. There food is simple, portioned and good. I am excited to try the other four meals I have in the fridge. You don&#39;t have to do the meal plans but it does save you time and money.

We&#39;ve been talking about going for months and we finally found ourselves nearby so we decided to go for a late lunch. Upon entering, there was a weird, bad grill smell- strike 1. The place was completely empty- strike 2. We ordered the Texas Chicken Nuggets, Rocky Balboa Wrap, and Arizona. Our food came out 2 minutes after we ordered it- strike 3!!!! I thought it was going to be great that it was empty, they&#39;d have plenty of time to cook our food, but no....they clearly took pre-cooked food and microwaved it. Every part of me did NOT want to eat this chicken and turkey bacon... And alas, I had an excuse not to- there was a hair or fuzz in it. My boyfriend said the Texas Chicken Nuggets tasted like &#34;canned chicken&#34;. 
Overall, I&#39;d rather go across the street to the grocery store and buy ANYTHING else than eat here again. I&#39;m sorry, we really wanted to like you Muscle Maker Grill, but you sadly disappointed us."

My friends and I really, really liked this place.  The food tasted great, which I wasn&#39;t expecting because I thought it was going to be bland health food. I was totally wrong!  This place is great!  

What I learned is that most of their food is made fresh, not frozen.  That&#39;s one of the things that makes it such a healthy option.  

First thing I noticed is our food arrived to our table steaming hot!  Sweet!  I ordered the El Mexicana from their entree menu.  It had seasoned chicken, black beans, rice, bell peppers, cheese, and salsa.  Mmmm!  It was more than I could eat.  I took some home.  They have these really cute take-home containers that are microwavable, dishwasher safe, and reusable!  I&#39;m totally saving this for future uses.  

One of my friends ordered the Rocky Balboa wrap.  The Rocky Balboa had a blend of chicken and meatballs with mozzarella cheese and a tasty sauce.  I was lucky to get a taste before my friend ate it all.  After one taste, I knew why he ate it so fast.  It was SO good!!  I think I&#39;ll order that next time.  The wrap came with a side dish.  My friend chose the spicy chunks of potato and loved them too!  

My other friend ordered the grass-fed beef burger and had a side of the greenest, brightest, most flavorful broccoli she had ever seen or tasted.  I don&#39;t know what their secret is, but this was beautiful broccoli!  The burger was incredible, so tender and juicy!

We will DEFINITELY be back!  Looking at their menu, Muscle Maker Grill delivers and also offers meal plans. That&#39;s cool.   There are lots of options to explore at this place.  They will certainly see us again."

I had the burger, it was cooked to my liking and had a great sauce. I really enjoyed it, along with the side of cold pasta salad. 
A friend had a chicken and broccoli dish, the broccoli was very green and fresh and had a wonderful balsamic vinegar sauce. 
The steak wrap had a great deal of steak and the side of spicy potatoes hit the spot for another friend. 
Being a cheese burger and fries kind of gal, I was totally suprised and impressed by the food I was served. I don&#39;t live close to this restaurant, but when I&#39;m in the area I will make it a point to eat here."

They have the carb heavy for the bulkers, salads, lean protein, low carb meals for the cutters, protein shakes, vegetarian meals, and snacks. We loved everything about this place and the food was delicious. My boyfriend had the Godfather &#34;guiltless entrée&#34; it came with TWO chicken breast on a bed of broccoli and some portobello mushrooms and peppers. I tried some.. And wanted more. I had the TeX Mex fajita wrap and a cucumber salad both were the bomb. Considering going there again this week the place was so good.

We left the outlet mall looking for something to eat that didn&#39;t involve a burger and I&#39;m glad we did. 

Service was excellent from the moment we stepped in, we were greeted by two different people. We managed to snag a table on a busy night without a reservation - next time I will call ahead because a couple was turned away shortly after us. The restaurant had a lot of large group reservations coming in and their phones were ringing constantly for take-out orders. 

We stared with the Tusk Sampler, and opted to pay a bit more to replace the spring roll with the coconut shrimp (so worth it). We ordered the Panang Chicken and Pad See Ew as entrees and they were delicious. We finished with the combination mochi and the Thai custard. 

This will now be my go-to spot after leaving the aurora outlet mall. I love this place!"

Prices were very reasonable and the food was good.

Siam Sampler for 4 $16 - A sampler of summer roll, money bag, wraps, gyo, and coconut shrimp.  The wraps were my favorite out of this bunch and the rest were decent.

Chive Dumpling $6 - I was a little disappointed with these.  The outside was nice and crispy, but the rest was mushy and tasteless.  I felt like the chives were overdone, too.  

Pad Woon Sen with pork $10 - This was delicious!  There was a street smoky flavor to it that reminded me of Thailand.

Three Flavored Fish $14.95 - Deep-fried red snapper fillet topped with an exotic Thai sauce.  And covered in sauce (sweet and spicy) it was!  It was pretty good.

I had the Panang Curry. It was just the right amount of food. Sauce was good- veggies were crisp and fresh and tofu was good. I was very pleased and could easily become addicted!!
Husband had Basil Beef. He said it was spicy and quite good. 
Daughter had the Sesame Chicken which she ate up and announced &#34;We HAVE to come here again&#34;.
For dessert, husband and I had the sticky rice with mango. This was excellent and just sweet enough to end our meal. Daughter had the fried ice cream - it looked quite good and she really enjoyed it.

But its pretty darn close. 

I called to place a to-go order on a Wednesday evening and the man on the phone had just the sweetest voice without a hint of impatience. It was the kind of voice that makes you think you&#39;re talking to your grandfather. So being my first impression, I was already pleased. He did neglect to give me my total over the phone but, no big deal.

When we went to pick up our food at the downtown Batavia location, the whole area was bustling with people. The inside was crowded and their was a group of girlfriends gathering outside preparing to go in. My food was ready in the 15 minute timeframe promised by the man on the phone.

We got the chicken satay as an appetizer which included 4 skewers of chicken with lite yellow curry and a scrumptious peanut dipping sauce. I could have drank that stuff! However, the chicken was kind of dry and nothing special. I probably would not order again.

As for entrees we both got the pad thai (request for spicy!) mine with tofu and Brock&#39;s with shrimp. Both were cooked perfectly. The flavors were perfect and it was just the right amount of spiciness. The lime it comes with really sets it off! In the future I will ask for extra lime slices.

The price was typical as far as Thai restaurants. Our total was $30.00. Next time I want to eat-in and take advantage of the BYOB!"

It&#39;s been my go-to for when someone who&#39;s vaguely adventurous food-wise is in town. Rave reviews all around. The price is great considering the quality of the meal you&#39;re getting. If it&#39;s busy be prepared to wait a little bit (always worth it). Service is efficient, and food comes out quickly. BYOB so grab a bottle before you head over, and I don&#39;t believe there was a glassware or corkage fee last time we were there.

The siam sampler is a good call, the money bags and the tusk wraps in particular are worth grabbing an order to-go for when you&#39;re craving them in a few hours. 
I tend to stick with mostly noodle dishes (so far). Pad See Ew was my most recent meal, delicious and cooked well though I wish there was a little more egg. My absolute favorite, and the reason I&#39;ve been unable to try more entree options, is the Panang Curry Noodles with shrimp. Oh my gosh the coconut curry sauce is so good you&#39;ll go half your meal muttering to yourself like a crazy person how good it is. The crispy noodles and fresh veggies make for the perfect comfort food.
Green curry was super tasty, a good amount of heat. I had a roast duck meal a while back that was pretty good too. Solid pad thai, and their various fried rices have been decent. 

Absolutely worth a drive if you&#39;re not super close by."

They are very accommodating, food was pretty good, and service was good. Not an exceptional place, but dependably good. We have tried a variety of dishes over the years and all have been acceptable to quite good. We love the money bags appetizer. We have been here several times and they are always about the same.

A note for people who (think they) like spicy food: Tusk Thai will not be stingy with the heat. If you&#39;re not really used to hot food, don&#39;t set out to prove anything by asking for the spiciest items. Start with mildly spicy food, and work your way up!"

Crab rangoons, money bags, and potstickers. I asked for actually money in my money bags, instead I got a nice combination of shrimp and meat inside of wonton wrappers. Crab rangoons and potstickers oh my gosh yum. 

Panagn noodles tasted so good for such a beautiful snowy night! Noodles cooked well and crispy, curry with coconut milk was smoothly sweet, and tofu cooked perfectly.

Finally, Thai Pumpkin Custard, how is custard this good?

I had the Panang Noodles with shrimp. OMG, is all I can say.
The portions aren&#39;t huge, but wouldn&#39;t you rather have great food, smaller portions?!
That being said, it&#39;s more than enough, it&#39;s just not an obnoxious portion. 
We went at an off time, so we were seated right away.  And the service was phenomenal. We had our children and they brought them Hello Kitty cups, made a fan napkin, and rigged some chopsticks for them to use. It&#39;s not a large place so I&#39;m  sure during peak dining hours it would be a wait. However, I would definitely wait for their cuisine. WELL WORTH IT!

Best Tom Kah soup I have ever had: the key is to balance the several different spices and the fish/chili paste stock, also the coconut milk they use is not watery. 
Best comfort food served? Lard Nah in a generous serving size. The tasty Basil Beef has fresh basil in it. 
Appetizers? Don&#39;t miss the large Coconut Shrimp with tender pieces of shredded coconut: some places serve shrimp with coconut flavored batter BUT not here! This is real coconut.

 Don&#39;t like it too spicy? Let them know because it can get authentically THAI hot :) Hint: if it&#39;s too spicy ask for a glass of coconut water (comes with the pulp in it, Mmm) and that will quench the fire. 

Perfect white rice, just the right amount of moisture. I normally hate white rice but theirs I will eat :) Don&#39;t miss the Mango Sticky Rice dessert or the serving of Pumpkin Custard, a light dessert for when you are full :)

 It&#39;s a family owned restaurant where I think I have seen 3 different generations serving and during non-rush hours they will enjoy having a chat with you on restaurant ownership and the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.

And by little I mean make a reservation b/c its small and popular.  I came here with a big group and we had a wonderful meal.  Its a BYOB so we stopped by the local liquor store that&#39;s nearby.  They are good about keeping your water filled but they didn&#39;t offer to put my bubbly on ice.  That&#39;s ok b/c it didn&#39;t last long enough to get warm.  
We stared with an appetizer sampler.  The one that comes with a spring roll, money bag, coconut shrimp, dumpling and lettuce cup.  Everything was one bite which was perfect!  Very tasty.  I liked everything.
I had the shrimp casserole which took longer than everyone else at the table.  I&#39;m not going to remove a star for that but it was annoying as there were 7 of us and only 1 didn&#39;t get their food right away.  When it came out I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be in a clay pot with a lid.  The flavors were great but it was a little difficult to eat.  I didn&#39;t want to get any of it on my shirt.  Its like a soup but full of noodles and shrimp with the tails still on.  That is awkward when they don&#39;t give you a knife.  I think next time I&#39;ll stick with a basic noodle dish.
We tried two of the desserts.  The fried ice cream and chocolate cake.  The cake was the winner.  The ice cream was not like the Mexican kind but more like a fried wonton over a little scoop of vanilla.  It tasted like a donut which is not a bad thing.
This is where I would go if I found myself back in Batavia at dinnertime."

I gesture to the table and have a seat.  

  I&#39;m brought a menu that was smaller than expected but lunch specials are in order.  I eventually decide on the panang curry.  When order I was met with a blank stare.  An awkward pause then I toe a second look at the menu as I felt I had missed something.  Ah yes, with chicken.  Nothing but a quiet hmph or sorts and away she went.  

  I spiked my tasty Thai iced coffee, a must at any Thai restaurant if you ask me.  My food arrices, tho smaller than expected, and not as flattering to the eyes as I hoped.   I took my first bite was quite pleasntly surprised.  Tender chicken with a good balance of curry and spices.  The rice sticky and delicious.  The portion just right for a lunch special.

Pretty big portion too! To make things even better it&#39;s a BYOB place so you&#39;ll notice your bill is not looking crazy because when you dine out somewhere, mixed drinks or whatever it is you&#39;re drinking, usually makes your meal a little pricy.

The good:  The food was excellent, and Tusk Thai is BYOB.

The not-so-good:  The service was pretty atrocious.  We were seated quickly, given water and a corkscrew immediately by the bus boy, but that was it.  Despite the relatively small size of the place, and the fact that we were in the middle (rather than a table in a corner) no one seemed to notice or care that we hadn&#39;t been given menus.  Employees literally walked past us or tended to other tables numerous times without noticing.  After 10 minutes, I walked to the server station and asked for menus.  The hostess apologized profusely, gave us menus and walked away.

I was hoping that this might have improved the amount of attention they bestowed on us.  I was wrong.  We then waited another 15 minutes for someone to come by and take our order.  In short, it took a grand total of 25 minutes for someone to take our order.  They don&#39;t get a pass in my book simply because it was a Saturday night... they&#39;re an established business and should be able to deal more efficiently with the ebbs and flow of service.  Plus, it&#39;s a small restaurant, and someone should have noticed we weren&#39;t being serviced.

I respect small family run businesses, so I&#39;m going to give them another chance, but at least on this evening, the service wasn&#39;t acceptable."

My S.O. and I have an obsessive need to find the best Thai food, nearest Elgin.  Since the passing of our beloved Akina&#39;s, our search has taken us from Crystal to Schamburg, Saint Charles, Algonquin and Batavia.  

Tusk does so many things well. 

Tusk is a BYOB restaurant.  There is no corking fee/glass fee for bringing your own wine/beer.  Most of the other tables here also had a bottle (or more) of wine on them.   This is a really nice touch, and one of the reasons we chose to try it.  

Tusk is a very small restaurant, perhaps 20 tables for 2-3 people.  So arrive early or expect to wait.   Arriving at 6:30 on a Saturday,  my party of 3 got the last table for about an hour or so.  Next time, I will plan to arrive earlier, or much later. 

There is construction on the streets nearby, which creates some additional hassles. Also, the surrounding area is quite crowded with restaurants.  Expect parking to be an issue.  There is a very very small parking garage across the street.  However there was only a single space available when we arrived at 6:30.  The tight corners and narrow spaces may be intimidating for larger vehicles or hesitant drivers.  

**TIP:  drop your passengers off, then locate a parking spot. This may get you in quite a bit earlier, as parking could be a 10-15 minute hunt. ******


For the main course dinners as follows: 

Panang Curry with chicken:  My wife&#39;s favorite curry, and this one was delicious.  Nicely balanced sweet/sour/spicy/salty flavors.  

Pad Thai with tofu:  Well made, with noddles having a nice firm consistency, and fresh bean sprouts,  and carrots.  

Larb Kai with ground chicken:  Finally, a place that serves this.  Ordered extra spicy and I was in heaven. 

For dessert we requested mango&#39;s and sticky rice.   Unfortunately, they brought us papaya and sticky rice.  Not quite the same thing. 

It wouldn&#39;t have been a big deal to tell us they didn&#39;t have ripe mangoes (which I would have greatly appreciated.)  Instead we ended the otherwise delicious dinner on an off note.   Also the only reason why the got 4 stars not 5. 

Ce&#39; est la vie. 

Definitely want to go back and see if they can do better in the dessert area."

I ordered Pad Thai Pork, but before that, I got Tom Yum Chicken. 

The Tom Yum wasn&#39;t anything to write home about, but it was decent. It was kind of like a .500 baseball team in a crappy division, that still has a chance to win but never really &#34;wows&#34; anyone, if you will. If you don&#39;t know about baseball or sports in general, I am sorry that I confused you. Actually, not really, shame on you! Haha!

The Pad Thai Pork was excellent! Lots of flavor. I ordered it extra spicy, and the first three or four bites weren&#39;t that spicy, then I got into the nitty gritty....MERCY! I was sweating like a fat man in Tuscon, Arizona crossing the border illegally! I also added a little hot sauce prior to that, but it was nothing much...but mercy Thai ladies in back (I only saw ladies on the staff), you kicked my booty!

Our waitress, well, how do I say this without sounding like a complete jerk...I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD SHE SAID. She took our order, we got our food rather quick, so that was nice. The nice hostess girl was my hero, constantly filling my water, because I was sweating like O.J. and Casey Anthony right before they were found guilty of murder...wait, what...? Nevermind.

Cozy place, clean as a whistle. Great menu of food, and excellent service.

We were the second table in on a Tuesday night, but by the time we left the place was full. And with only one waitress on duty, we still felt more welcome than we did at the first place we stopped.

The chicken in the Green Fire dish was tender and tasty, the Red Curry was also VERY flavorful, although it could have been spicier. And the Chicken Satay could have used a bit more heat, too - but it was very good as well.

TIP: It&#39;s BYOB here and every table brought wine with them, so don&#39;t leave home without a bottle!"

The red curry was watery, flavorless(except for spicy) &amp; full of bamboo shoots. Like 10 bamboo shoots to 1 of any other ingredient. The Tom Kha was thin, curdled &amp; full of slimy mushrooms. The Pad Woon Sen was weak on flavor &amp; had clumps of noodles, bitter cabbage, more slimy mushrooms &amp; overcooked veggies. The Summer Rolls I didn&#39;t even try as the bean sprouts were way way past their prime(we&#39;re talking mushy, brown &amp; slimy). Overall it was really disappointing. I really had high hopes from the positive reviews &amp; a general desire for family run businesses to succeed, but I was let down. Maybe it&#39;s because we got take out. The dining room was cute &amp; had nice ambience. Hopefully it was just an off night."

I came during lunch hour which surprising it was not full.  The service was quick and the food tasted delicious.  My Thai Tea however was way too sweet for my comfort.  I did had to water it down.  I do plan on coming again to try their other dishes.  I gave this place a 4 star because it did not have a wide select of plates for a Thai Restaurant.  Overall, it is worth returning."

I hadn&#39;t been in a few months and was craving Thai.  The place was packed but the staff was very friendly and communicative on when we would have a table.  

We were seated and immediately brought glasses and a corkscrew for our wine.  This place is BYOB!

We each ordered an appetizer and an entree.  I had the Money Bags which are crispy little stuffed pouches. Two friends had the Chive Dumplings which they have raved about in the past.  For an entree I had the Pad Thai with chicken.  It&#39;s nothing exotic, but I think Tusk has the BEST.  I couldn&#39;t tell you what my friends ordered because I was so wrapped up in my Pad Thai, but they all enjoyed their dinners. 

The place was winding down for the night but our sweet server - who I believe is the owner&#39;s daughter - never rushed us so we stayed and chatted and finished our wine.  

Our bill was $20 each for app &amp; entree which I think makes for a great, reasonable girls night out.  Overall  the food and service was great.  I always love this place and need to visit or do carry out more often."
tusk-thai-cuisine-batavia,Dave S.,viNNiVtWSSBCbNPwuNV65A,"Lombard, IL",0,1,0,30,7,EbfeSeV6X905U__XaHu0nA,5.0,2013-03-04,"Life isn&#39;t fair. How come I live in Lombard, with a population of 43,000 that has no Thai in its downtown area, but little Batavia (population of 27K or so) gets THREE Thai downtown joints? Why? Where was the Thai when I lived here?

Of those three, Yelp reviewers gave the biggest thumbs-up to Tusk Thai. I remember this building as the place that used to be the ironically-named Global Cafe, a coffee shop owned by the current city administrator, back in the &#39;90s. But that somewhat sterile environment is long gone, with pleasant paneling, lighting and shades. However, it is still cozy.

We were about to be seated in a cramped table for two, but when my wife and her big winter coat couldn&#39;t easily fit into the seat, they quickly offered to move us. It was still a little cramped, and as were by the door, we felt a draft every time someone came in for a seat or for take-out, and there were a fair number of people taking it out.

With time to kill before the play at the local theater started, we ordered an appetizer of tempura before entrees of drunken noodles and panang with crispy noodles.

I&#39;m not an expert on tempura, but I can&#39;t imagine it ever being much better than Tusk&#39;s version. Light breading, a big and tasty variety of vegetables and shrimp, decent sweet-and-sour sauce. Who would slice a cobette in half and fry it? Tusk would! Cool. Even the carrot was good.

My drunken noodle entree (no &#34;pad kee mao&#34; here, just &#34;drunken noodles&#34;) was a little light on the drink, and that was just fine for me on this evening. A nice assortment of vegetables were part of the entree. It was pretty good, though not a personal best. My eyes kept wandering toward my wife&#39;s dish. (Usually my eyes wander her way anyway.)

The server (and daughter of the owner) said that, even though rice soaks up the panang sauce better, using lightly-fried noodles was the trendy urban way to eat panang. (In Batavia? Trendy? Well, it&#39;s not the town I remember, so maybe.) And it was fantastic. Our entrees came before we were finished with the appetizer, but the server&#39;s suggestion was not to wait on the noodles. The panang had a good mix of vegetables and meat. The crispy-in-places noodles were a welcome complement to the incredible sauce. 

Tusk&#39;s panang has spoiled my wife. She&#39;s told me that she won&#39;t be able to try anything else on Tusk&#39;s menu. Maybe panang with rice. But that panang was killer. Get this and you may want a spoon to get at the rest of the sauce. Or a straw. I won&#39;t even fault you for licking the plate; it crossed my mind more than once.

Perhaps next time I&#39;ll get something else and have an updated review, but I don&#39;t see how I can give Tusk less than five stars. It&#39;s quality food and a decent price with a nice, small-guy ambiance. Dang you, Batavia. Lombard should be so lucky."

The first time I met someone here for lunch I thought I must have had an unusual experience based on the positive reviews. Nope. Went there today to meet a different friend. The only thing positive was the water and the price.
Sesame chicken had tiny bits of chicken in mounds of batter and a thick sauce that didn&#39;t contain any sesame seeds. The rice was soggy. No vegetables. Poorly made spring rolls. My friend&#39;s Pad Thai was just a gooey mass of noodles with a couple of sprouts. The lime, cilantro, egg and carrots were missing.
I have been to Thailand multiple times and street vendors do a better job. Avoid this place."
tusk-thai-cuisine-batavia,Kedar D.,e7V5B3xq3rRNxmABwFKqVw,"Los Angeles, CA",1,1,0,379,353,EKDEhKYx_2mjgLHYEkJ7UQ,3.0,2012-01-07,"Wow, Tusk has improved a lot since I first went there (shortly after it opened). For one thing, the menu explicitly states that it doesn&#39;t use fish sauce (though I later learned they might use oyster sauce, so make sure to ask questions if you are vegan or vegetarian) and it offers at least a few unusual dishes, as well as a coconut ice cream vegan dessert. 

This time around I got a few dishes for take-out:

-chive dumpling (appetizer) ($4.95)
-&#34;Thai Fire Dish&#34; with tofu ($10.95)
-&#34;Five Star&#34; with tofu ($10.95)

The chive dumpling is a dish you won&#39;t easily find at most other Thai restaurants in the Chicago area (or anywhere, for that matter). It&#39;s basically pan-friend rice dumplings filled with chives. While the dish sounded good in theory, in execution I found the dumplings bland, even with the sweetish soy dipping sauce they give on the side. I think they need to put more chives and maybe garlic and other minced vegetables in the dumplings in order to add more flavor.

The Thai Fire Dish is labeled extremely spicy and they aren&#39;t kidding: this dish will have you in tears. That said, if you like extra-spicy dishes, this one is a goldmine. I loved the savory flavors and the mix of vegetables (bamboo shoots and bell peppers) which gave the dish a colorful look.

The Five Star provided good contrast as it featured more sweetness; indeed, the sauce consisted of half savory and half sweet tones. Mixed with roasted chili, the sauce came out pretty well but could have been just a tad less sweet. That said, it&#39;s an unusual flavor that you won&#39;t find at other Thai restaurants easily. 

Both main dishes come in generous portions that will give you lots of leftovers. One gripe: Tusk doesn&#39;t offer brown rice.

Lastly, they have a non-dairy coconut ice cream on the menu which I didn&#39;t get, but which is pretty awesome, nevertheless. Most Thai restaurants will only have sticky rice with bamboo as the vegan dessert of choice; Tusk, in offering a coconut ice cream, shows some creativity and boldness. I like that.

All told, Tusk is a pretty solid restaurant and much better than the other Batavia Thai joints; there are only two Thai restaurants, in my humble opinion that beat Tusk in the Chicago area: Bangkok Restaurant in Geneva, and Urban Vegan in Chicago. All that said, I will be returning to Tusk."

However, TT had relatively slow service, even when we were one of three parties in the restaurant. Also, we kept having to ask to have our drinks refilled.

This time it was just my boyfriend and me; he had the panang curry noodles (thick fried noodles in a red curry sauce with beef and an array of veggies; he said he wished he had some bread to sop up every drop of the sauce! I don&#39;t normally even like curry but I had a bite and really liked it) and the Samsahai for me (a seafood stew that his mom got the first time and had looked appealing then).  

We also ordered the chive dumplings for an appetizer, crispy pan-seared wonton pockets filled with chives and served with a delicious sweet chile-soy sauce (even after the dumplings were gone, it was tempting to eat the sauce by the spoonful). 

Again, the restaurant is small, so get there early if you want to be assured a table without a wait. It&#39;s a cozy spot with a great atmosphere and food; I want to trumpet the talents of Tusk far and wide! If you&#39;re in the mood for Thai, this is the place in the Western &#39;burbs."

The chicken pad thai is what you expect it to be - yummy.  Thai Bistro has their take on it, but I&#39;m not a fan.  Tusk Thai has the pad thai as I want it to be.

We tried the Tom Yum soup and their Tom Kar soup.  They are kind of opposites of each other with the Tom Yum being more savory and the Tom Kar as more tangy-sweet as it has coconut milk in it.  I&#39;d order eithe one again.

The mango sticky rice is fabulous too."

I&#39;ve been here twice.  First note is the laughably steep entrance &#34;ramp&#34; into the building which I am sure is pretty much a no-go for anyone in a wheelchair.  Also with the doorway situation (and lack of a vestibule breezeway door) I was fully expecting a drafty dining experience, but even sitting a few feet from the door on a freezing evening, that concern was totally unfounded.  The decor of the place is quite hip and clean and I was digging it.  I was half expecting it to be run by some super trendy staff, but it was what you would expect from a family run asian restaurant.  I wan&#39;t to be super clear and say the restaurant staff is awesome with table service manners that far exceeded my expectations (not exactly a 3 star michelin spot that will fold your napkin for you if you make a trip to the bathroom, but not too far below that).

The food blew me away,  I have no idea if these are mainly traditional dishes that I just haven&#39;t been exposed to or if this is boarder-line fusion, but it was quite the experience.  This is probably best experienced with a small group with family style dining.  And I highly recommend going nuts on the appetizers.   This place is a rare gem that is worth travelling to.  Plus when you add in the BYOB factor, this place is a huge bang for your buck.

Also, the menu is quite vegetarian friendly!"

my husband had sesame chicken - which was sweet, crunchy and tasty.  sometimes deep fried food with a sauce can be mushy, this was not.

i ordered the tofu pad thai - extra spicy - thai spicy - not white girl hot - as I told the waitress.   it was perfect!!!  i usually always have to add extra spice (I like it hot hot hot) and i didn&#39;t need to...the tofu, was perfect.   check it out, good stuff!"

The hand drawn sign was kind of simple and the restaurant can easily be overlooked for a local bar. But don&#39;t be fooled. Tusk Thai has amazing food and a wonderful staff that accommodated our party of seven. 

My in-laws, niece, husband and I enjoyed a feast of food that included a huge appetizer plate, salads and coconut ice cream for dessert. I opted for the Vegetarian Pad Thai and it was awesome. The location near the Batavia River walk is quite perfect for walking off the post-dinner woes. 
Highly recommended!"

The food was excellent. I spent 2 months backpacking through Thailand, so I have very high expectations for my Thai food and Tusk Thai definitely met them. 

The location is a little small and when we arrived, it was the end of the dinner crowd and a bit noisy. But by 8, all the kids had cleared out and the place was nice and quiet, which is exactly what we were looking for. We will definitely be going back here again."

The place itself is nicely decorated and family run, but it is rather cramped, especially on a Friday night at full capacity. Either way, I enjoyed myself there, and will try it again.

The quality of the food we had was pretty decent. The vegetables were very fresh and overall pretty tasty, though the sauces were a little on the sweet side. Portions were just right - not so much food that you take half of it home with you, but enough that you leave feeling sated. Good variety in the menu.

The service, on the other hand, was really, really slow. It was quite literally the first time in my life I&#39;ve waited more than 10 minutes for Thai food. Our server was basically non-existent, and it took FOREVER to get our dinner - it was almost to the point where we were going to have to take our meals to go. I want to cut them a little slack because the dining room was basically full, but it&#39;s maybe a dozen tables for two servers. Should be manageable.

Just this past night, 8/2/16, my sister, brother, and I decided to have hibachi and sushi here at the Jurin in South Elgin. I haven&#39;t eaten here in over a couple years since my friend was a waiter at the same location. I used to come for the lunch special and get fantastic service.

Tonight, we got subpar service from an angsty, upper 20s/lower 30s waitress. She didn&#39;t remember my sister&#39;s order of a Pepsi or that I ordered a water and a Sprite, just bringing out the Sprite. Additionally, when that said waitress and another of her co-workers came out ~ they served my sister and my sushi to the family to the right of us and caught the mistake as the kid was eating pieces of our sushi. I was a little bitter as I had just got off working a 10 hour shift at Home Depot but my sister told me to &#34;shut up&#34; as we received poor service that was being openly complained about by the couple to the left of us, who I overheard celebrating their first anniversary (wedding? I&#39;m not sure). 

After the sushi was brought out, the chef misread the order or follow the order to a tee and served the shrimp that was part of my &#34;steak and shrimp&#34; dinner to the family to the right of us, yet again mistaking our order for theirs. Right when I was going to correct the chef, he cut up the shrimp into tiny pieces and served it around the table instead of asking who&#39;s order it was - assuming it was mistake on the part of the waitress. I was livid and asked for a refill of Sprite to which I was given an eye roll by said waitress. 

Later on, we asked for our own chopsticks after not receiving the initial sushi on time. Yet, by the time we received the sushi again, we finished the hibachi ~ steak and calamari for my brother and just &#34;steak&#34; for me since they had cut up the shrimp that could have complemented my order.

Early on, I should have known service would be low quality when one of the chef assistants who was passing out the salad and soup asked me if I wanted a soup and salad (it should be an inherent, yes). 

I understand that it was dinner time, roughly before 8pm and I would&#39;ve understood if the waitress had asked more than once for clarification about drink orders, sushi orders, and lowered the amount of sass she evoked right away. Attitude speaks volume in  the customer service industry coming from someone who has been in customer service for 6+ years.

I know now that I should only try to come back during a slow period of lunch or just stick to Mr. Samurai in Saint Charles which is a further drive but has a lot better quality in terms of service and more affordable prices."

With a group of six and a reservation for seven pm I was excited. Walking in I noticed that this place is divided into two sections. The smaller section was for the non teppanyaki customers. The bigger section was for everybody&#39;s favorite the teppanyaki. I also noticed a bar to the right as your walk in.

Teppanyaki: my choice was the Shrimp and Filet Mignon combo. Lacking in shrimp was my first issue. Soy sauce used on my shrimp. Makes me miss the B:( the fried rice tho was not bad. Although they assume you want fried rice and never asked otherwise. My Filet Mignon was juicy and tender. 

Their sautéed onions was partnered with green beans and mushrooms. So that was nice and pretty tasty. 

The shrimp needed more company. It was not enough. There was no free ice cream dessert like everywhere else  instead it was $2+ for a little cup. 

They have a different take on pairing the dual suspects. Verdict? I&#39;m still looking for a replacement for B."

This review is based solely on the sushi, we did not have any hibachi, so please keep that in mind. 

I am a picky bastard with sushi. I really am. While some of the rolls we tried were ok, the sashimi was disappointing. The cuts were all over the place, and it wasn&#39;t as fresh as I would like. The service there was good, I liked our server, but I would not come back for the sushi."

It&#39;s by my wife&#39;s parents house and it&#39;s their go to place for most celebrations. Whether it&#39;s sushi or hibachi, it&#39;s always a good time.

First with this place, I like the prices. It&#39;s about half the cost of a Benihana or Japan 77 and I feel like you get so much more food with the hibachi. Dinners are roughly $12-$15 I believe. I usually get the steak and shrimp. Also comes with the soup, salad, fried rice, and noodles. MMmmm.

The last few times though, our chefs haven&#39;t really been doing tricks. Maybe it&#39;s because the youngest person with us is 27, but hey, we still love a good show. I want to see some shrimp tails get tossed.

Speaking of the sushi side, I sat around the conveyor belt a few times and those are reasonably priced too. I&#39;m not really a big sushi guy though, give me some California rolls or straight sashimi and I&#39;m good with that.

Great place, staff is always super friendly and jokes around with us. I have noticed it&#39;s a little hard to get refills though. I usually have to flag down a waiter, but they probably just think we&#39;re too focused on the chef cooking our food.

You can grab small plates from the fresh made sushi conveyer belt and sample different kinds of maki rolls or nigiri pieces. The plates are different colored (depending on the type of sushi) and you are charged accordingly. 

In addition to sushi there&#39;s different types of calamari or seaweed salads, shrimp, fresh fruits, desserts, etc on the belt. 

Or, you can order whole rolls and nigiri from the chefs (who are super friendly and very knowledgable!! Love these guys!)

There&#39;s hibachi if you&#39;re into that... We&#39;ve never tried it but it&#39;s always busy with people at the tables.

Yelp really mislead me on this. The locals seem to think this is good sushi...it&#39;s not. In fact, this place is a rip off, and I will prove this with a photo (you will have to look in the Yelp photos). Check out the spicy tuna roll pieces next to a kanikama nigiri (crab stick sushi). Anyone who has seen a crab stick knows they are about the size of a finger. The picture doesn&#39;t even do it justice. I have never seen sushi this small in my life! Ok, I have to force myself to move on from this point. If you are lucky enough to get a seat near the rotating sushi bar (maybe 10 seats) you will notice that most of the tiny dishes with tiny servings going by are priced around the $3.75 range. Funny thing, is you can order everything in the revolving sushi bar from the menu, but the price varies. Same items, different price. Sometime more sometimes less. Example: 2 pieces of salmon sushi cost less on the bar, than they do from the menu. Most other things were equal or more expensive on the menu. Also, most rolls on the menu are only 4 tiny pieces!!! Everywhere else, you get 6-8 normal human sized pieces, not at JuRin! I think they are used to feeding mice or something. Table for Stuart Little!!! Pricing was too much for the size of the meal. Also, these hibachi/teppanyaki places normally have great fried rice. It looked good, but had almost no taste! A complete letdown (I drove 45 minutes to try this place). The only thing that gives them 2 stars is that some of the sushi tasted okay. Oh and the service was horrible too. Somehow this place is packed, and I actually had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. Probably because there are no good alternatives in this area. AVOID."

Easy to make our 1 pm reservation for 6 and we were sat promptly.  Kids had a blast (high chairs and boosters available).  Between the 6 of us we got the filet minion, shrimp (hibachi and garlic style), teriyaki chicken, and the lunches all came with soup and salad.  The place is a bargain for what is essentially a show and meal.  I think it was $13 for the the filet and shrimp. So the small salad on it&#39;s own won&#39;t be winning any awards but it&#39;s a nice addition to the soup prior to the meal.  I was impressed and the kids enjoyed that a small dish of ice cubes was brought specifically to them for their soup as they couldn&#39;t eat it right away as it was too hot for them.  The reactions on the kids faces (3 and 6 y.o) was worth the trip as they watched the chef twirl and juggle the egg and yolk. 

Also the food was delicious.  Friend rice tasted great and of course was piping hot as it was just made in front of us.  Shrimp tasted great with the sauces presented to us before the meal. Filet was tender and cooked perfectly and just as we requested.

On your birthday, you get a song from the staff, a fruit plate with a slice of pastry, a lighted candle, a rose and a free dinner on your next birthday. And my beverages are oftened refilled without calling them. 
Sushi chefs inside the conveyor belt is always smiling and would say thank you before you leave and if you are in the table beside them, they just hand you your sushi orders.
Food. I would give them 5 stars but it was the sushi that pulled me back. Especially the sashimi in the conveyor belt. Tuna sashimi already looked dry. The sushi slices were a tad small. Flavors were good. Just wished it was a little fresher. 
Teppanyaki is the bomb. Cooks are hilarious on the table (although some tries very hard to be funny)... The fried rice is awesome!!!! The steaks sometimes i get the melt in your mouth ones but tonight i got the dry and a little bit on the chewy side.

Clearly they are trying to cut costs by doing this and thinking people won&#39;t notice. At dinner today our server hardly paid attention to us and had to be asked multiple times for things. I asked for artificial sugar for my tea which he never brought and I had to ask twice for mustard sauce which was supposed to come with the meal anyway. Never refilled drinks. Brought my friend the wrong food and me the incorrect steak but for that I blame the cook. Ju Rin no longer has my business. They run a shitty business.

Then our cook after making the fried rice giving everyone at the table inadequate portions (small), takes a tray puts the rest of the fried rice on the tray then rudely walked away and asked the other busboy to take the tray in the back.  WHAT THE HECK WERE THEY GOING TO DO WITH THE RICE? OUR BOWLS WERE DEFINITELY NOT FULL!   Then the veggies come on seriously my plate was served 3 greenbeans and 2 zucchini slices.

Dining room is attractive if rather dark, decorated in light plum.  There is a small separate bar area.

Teppan lunches are in the $8.95-$15.95 range.  I had a shrimp and scallop combo at $12.95:  3 scallops, 6 shrimp.  Accompanied by some sort of mushroom soup, a salad heavy on iceberg lettuce, noodles, and fried rice.  Scallops were tender, with a touch of garlic.  Shrimp were a simple sauté.  The teppan chef (not noticeably Japanese) was businesslike, not engaging in Benihana-style schtick.

Beer selection is mostly common industrial lagers.  The only thing new to me was Lucky Buddha, a bland, low-hop Chinese lager in an interesting molded bottle."

jurin-japanese-restaurant-south-elgin,Andrew S.,TlDX6BxYLs_tH5I1nL7uRg,"Crystal Lake, IL",0,1,0,0,27,BYHfDAy51M_EZbXyBlmpgg,2.0,2016-04-30,"This is a long review, but thorough. If the only hibachi experience I ever went to was JuRin, this would probably be somewhere between a 3 and 4 star review. However, I have been to numerous different hibachi restaurants in IL and in other states, and I have also been here 3 times on different nights, so I have a good basis for comparison. I am no food snob, but I have experienced the entire range of horrible and amazing restaurants. I will try to keep opinions out and just stick with facts as I have experienced them.


I will start with the good. 
The price: JuRin is cheaper than most others like this. However, that is balanced out with smaller portions. Elsewhere, my wife and I need to take 2 large containers of leftovers home between us. Here, we have 1 medium size container between the two of us. If you want to spend less on a meal that still feels fancy, this is great. Other similar places might give you a bit of a sticker shock by comparison. The price to portion ratio is the same on both the hibachi and sushi. Very good if you want to try many different things.

The mustard sauce: Most places will give you a mustard sauce that is quite heavy with mustard and horseradish, which is quite pungent and overpowers your food. The sauce here is light, smooth, and reminds me of a Japanese version of honey-mustard. It has a lighter garlic and mustard flavor that does not detract from the other flavors of your meal. If anything it makes the meal far better. It is great poured on fried rice and nearly all other parts of your dish. No other restaurant makes the mustard sauce quite like this (it&#39;s amazing).


Middle of the road:
Service: I would say it&#39;s average considering that this is essentially a strip mall based hibachi/sushi place. I don&#39;t feel like I am getting bad service, but it is not anything great either. When at a cooking table, I may not get a refill right away. You have to ask for chopsticks since they are not given automatically. If you do go to a cooking table, you will have to ask for a sushi menu as that is also not automatically given. The sushi menu is a small piece of paper with checkboxes and names of items. There are no descriptions or pictures so ordering may be difficult for some. Most places have an ingredient list and sometimes pictures. When ordering sushi at a cooking table, it is usually delivered very quickly. This seems like an overall positive, but does make me wonder how much of it is pre-prepared (not entirely fresh). There have been rolls that seem fresh and others not so much. Their salad dressing tastes strange, but every place does it different; it&#39;s not bad, but I am not a fan. Their appetizer soup is pretty good.


The not so good: I always order the filet and one other item. Between sharing with my wife and friends, I have tried all the &#39;proteins&#39; at least twice. The scallops are fatty/mushy. Not firm at all and the texture just seems strange. Also, you only get 4 pieces that are a bit on the small side. If you want a more filling dinner, do not go with all seafood; mix it with steak or chicken. Most of the times food is at least a little overcooked. My medium rare filet was only slightly more tender than my wifes medium cooked regular steak. I find it a bit of a red flag if it is difficult to tell that you are eating filet vs regular steak. The chicken is always dry and my friends (who are regulars) stopped ordering it. The garlic topping for the seafood/shrimp is always very dry. We had a Mexican cook the last time we went here. Not necessarily a bad thing, but does take away from the authenticity and immersion of the experience. The cooks here always seem to be in more of a rush and do not do as many tricks as other places. There also is a bit less interaction and basic chatter between cook and guests so you lose even more of the entertainment value. I have always left here a little unfulfilled by the performance. The variety of sushi items seems really small compared to other places. The place feels cramped.


Other thoughts: The latest cook tried flipping food into our mouths, but only at the very tail end of the meal. This was done after all other food was cooked and on our plates and the table was already cleaned off. Everyone at the table was over halfway finished at that point and if not stuffed, then concentrating more on their plate or starting to think about to-go boxes. The timing would have been better earlier on when everyone was still hungry and attentive. The sushi/sashimi is good, especially for the price. The quality of the rolls can varies and is sometimes smothered in sauce that hides the real flavor. The rolls seem to have a little less fish than expected. The mustard sauce is the only major positive that stands out to me, but is necessary to make the food go from &#39;meh&#39; to &#39;pretty decent&#39;. No free dessert (Ice cream) at the end of the meal."

The food was pretty good, but our server was too busy goofing around with his friends that came in to really pay attention to what was going on and neglected to bring out our appetizers (but didn&#39;t fail to bring his buddies three orders of spring rolls when they only wanted one). The staff was notified by four separate members of my group that the women&#39;s bathroom was flooded and by the time my grandmother made her way to the washroom at the end of our meal, it still wasn&#39;t mopped. Besides being disgusting, it was a hazard and I find it a little silly that no one could take a few minutes to clean it up on an evening when there was plenty of time to stand around talking to coworkers. Oh, and it took twenty minutes to get our bill? I&#39;ll be back... But not anytime soon."

Our waitress was wonderful and very funny, and kept our group of 12 entertained and with numerous beverage refills throughout. We never wanted for anything- food was delicious and plentiful, the show was entertaining as always, and the beverages were delicious as well. My only complaint ever is that this place is still quite pricey- you definitely pay for the show that comes with the meal. They do have some of my favorite rice and teriyaki chicken, and I tried egg yolk shrimp for the first time- very rich. We have been here on other occasions for their sushi- it was also very good- we&#39;ve taken it to go as well. We will definitely come back for special occasions in the future- a fun night for all!"

Of course at that time, I never had sushi or eaten at a hibachi grill. It was last year, I believe, that I went to this place for the first time. We were celebrating my sister&#39;s birthday. We sat right next to a grill. It was then that it was brought to my attention about how the chefs cook on the grill. It surprised me skilled the chef was when cooking on the grill. Seeing all the ingredients that was being cooked amazed me because it was more than enough to feed the all of us. The best part was when the chef got some shrimp and tossed them to see if any one of us would catch them in our mouths.

Our ages ranged from one 11 month old baby to 60 year old grandparents.  Our reservations were at 5pm, and we were all seated on time. Within a few short minutes the server had taken our meal orders and sushi app order, and the entertainment began.

The chef did a great job of entertaining everyone around the hibachi. Our server also made sure our drinks, etc were replenished quickly and often. Quality of both the hibachi and sushi appetizers we had were spot on, everyone thoroughly enjoyed everything ordered. At the end, they sang happy birthday to my husband, and took a fun pic of all of us gathered around.

One issue which brings the review down: we were being rushed out at the end of our meal so that the restaurant could seat their next guests. When I looked at my watch, I realized that with appetizers, hibachi, and dessert we had been there for 50 minutes. 

50 minutes, and you&#39;re rushing us out the door? Not cool.  We chose to do hibachi to enjoy a more leisurely dinner so that we could all catch up around the table. Rushing us out the door before we even have a chance to order dessert for the group which was really annoying.

Will we return? Maybe. But if we do, next time, I&#39;m going to speak to the manager to be sure a reservation is not backed up so closely to ours."

Last time I came here with a bunch of co workers and ordered specifically sushi. Let me just say that the first time I ever tried sushi in my entire life I had it here at Jurin and Mr. Jurin was whipping out some good good sushi or I thought that at the time. Ok anyways this last time I went was about 2 weeks ago and the sushi was just crappy. I ordered an alaskan roll, spicy tuna, and some other one I forgot but it was just NOT GOOD at all. It was bad. The rice must&#39;ve been old rice. It was way too sticky. Why would you roll sushi with sticky rice? The rice should be firm not like someone chewed it up and spit it out and then rolled up for you to eat. It was super gross I couldn&#39;t even eat the rest of it I just gave it to my boss and friends to eat...

The hibachi for them was super fun though. The guy was entertaining and I&#39;m guessing that tasted alright because my coworkers did not complain at all. 

Let me just LOL for all of you.. This was what I thought was funny... This place did not even know how to set up sake bombs for my coworkers. None of my coworkers have ever done one and I&#39;m sitting in the corner wondering who&#39;s going to explain like are the workers supposed to??? They used the regular plastic cups and the ghetto wooden chopsticks with the little sake glasses. It was so funny...

The experience makes me hope that all the cute little kiddies and their families realize that this is a bastardization of a bastardization in the sense that Benihana is just one small segment of Japanese cuisine and JuRin&#39;s take on Benihana is a very watered down version at that.

We had a number of ALa carte sushi and rolls and it was excellent. I would recommend them highly (although my comments/thoughts from the previous visit disinclined me from going full 5star).
The caterpillar and dragon and Philadelphia rolls were awesome. The TOM roll is unique and rich (lightly tempura battered and fried!, w/cream cheese unagi++YUM) and highly recommended. Even the mackerel was great and being the fishiest fish is the test of a good sushi restsurant, and they pass with flying colors. But I won&#39;t get the uni there again (see previous review), otherwise do not hesitate"

We have been dining here for weekend lunch for years and the food and wait staff is consistently excellent.  The manager, Gen and the owner/chef Osada are always cheerful and welcoming and today our waitress, Parvanzh, was exceptionally good.

We typically have sushi but have enjoyed the tepanyaki table when celebrating our children&#39;s birthdays over the years and have always had great food and a fun time. The kids love it when the staff brings out a birthday dessert with candle and surround the table to sing/clap an Asian version of Happy Birthday. The pricing is reasonable enough that you can afford to let your kids bring their friends too.

The sushi plates on the conveyor are always fresh and a great way to share/taste the various rolls and also comes with soup &amp; salad. My husband always orders the super white tuna and the chef usually is handing it to him before he has a chance to order it. Great Place!"

They all miss this place and dream of the delicious, delicious food.  Can&#39;t go wrong here!

Love the avocado sushi, the matt &amp; sandy rolls.  I also like the philadelphia rolls, the crunchy rolls, shrimp tempura rolls...  YUM!  :)

Fried rice is delicious.  I&#39;d buy their mustard (white) sauce if I could.  It&#39;s like heroin.  Their chicken is good.  I like their salmon.  Filet is delicious.  Shrimp is really good.  Their garlic shrimp is amazing.  They cook their scallops for a long time, which you shouldn&#39;t when cooking scallops...so I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d recommend those, but I&#39;ve never actually had them, so I can&#39;t say!  :)  All I know is you typically only need to cook scallops for a few minutes and they cook them much longer than that.  I love the vegetables they cook.  Their soups are good.  I love their ginger salad dressing.  I can&#39;t speak ill about this place!!  So good!!!"

The hibachi is something you can consider too if you&#39;re looking for a big meal. Lobster and tenderloin beef hibachi for only $30. You can&#39;t find that cheap price in chicago. It comes with fried rice, salad, mushroom soup. It&#39;s really yummy!

By the way, if you come here on your birth date (or close to it), everyone there (servers, chefs, busboys) will sing you a happy birthday song. PLUS, you get a free dessert and free gift certificate for next year birthday.

Ju Rin was the first sushi I ever tasted and it is what got me hooked.  While we lived in Chicago, we would always compare our sushi to Ju Rin, and nothing would beat it.  We have been back a few times since the old owner has moved on, and we were really disappointed.  We thought maybe the first time we had a bad experience it was a fluke, but we were disappointed every time after that.  Our rolls were falling apart and the quality and flavor was just... meh.  Very sad.  We are about to try the one the owner opened in Wasco to compare.  We hope it&#39;s just as good as old Ju Rin because I don&#39;t know where we will eat our sushi from now on!"

come here frequently with my boyfriends family- always fresh food, fun atmosphere, and can&#39;t beat the prices! 

!! come for the lunch specials !!! 

my boyfriend and I split the sushi lunch special combo : soup, salad, and you choose 3 rolls (4 pieces of sushi per roll)- lots of food ! we got the boston- YUM, spicy tuna - FAVORITE, and naghalaski one- it was like yellowtail with green onions- very fishy. 

we also got a separate order of the spicy scallop roll- you tasted more of the chipotle mayo than anything but still pretty good.

we also got the chicken - filet mignon combo to split and was plenty of food. they essentially give you the same amount of rice and lo mein and split the meat! 

PS go for your birthday- you get a free rose and GIGANTIC fruit and tiramisu plate and they take a Poloroid picture you get to keep after and they send you a free entree coupon every year after !"

The first Time I went I was blown away at how much FOOD they give you. Everyone that works at this establishment makes me feel so welcome, they are so nice!

I tried Sushi for the first time here, and I fell in love right away. Sushi is like an art to me now, I appreciate it and want to explore it more!
Now I take my friends and Coworkers here. My Boss even treats us to lunch everyonce in a while too at Jurin.

If you have never tried Jurin, I would say go at lunch time because its cheaper and a little more relaxed then dinner time. Then you can really relax and take it all in. Also, it is much more fun to go as a group because if you go as a couple and sit at the Teppan tables they may seat you with other people (which I&#39;m totally fine with, but I guess some people are uncomfortable with the idea of sharing a table with others....c-mon people, live life a little! haha)"

The hibachi grill is super fun for families and couples, but if you go on a busy night the hibachi won&#39;t be as intimate because they seat multiple families at one table.  Either way I love it!

Everyone is always super friendly and attentive also!

The ONLY downfall...they are closed between 2 and 4:30 which makes it impossible for me to go between jobs because my break between jobs is from 3:30-4:30 :(

The rolls seemed like they were purchased from a grocery store and prepared the day prior. Although i never expect amazing suburban sushi, Not impressed at all. The udon was flavorless noodles mooshy and slimy beef overcooked and rubbery. Really sad given that 3 years ago I tried jurin for teppan and was pretty impressed.

Worst birthday ever.

Besides the fact that it&#39;s conveniently located 2.6 minutes from my house, they also have great lunch deals. I&#39;m actually not even sure if I&#39;ve ever been there for dinner. Anyways, if their prices can impress my dad, you know that&#39;s got to mean something.

I always get the calamari. I&#39;ve been trying to find a Japanese Restaurant that makes better calamari, but it just hasn&#39;t happened. The entrees always come with soup, salad, noodles, and rice so you never leave there feeling hungry. They also have a sushi bar with equally great prices which is perfect for a quick sushi fix.


On top of all that, they have the best service. I&#39;ve never been disappointed.

I ordered the tom roll which consisted of imitation crab, cream cheese and I think a bit of tempura shrimp wrapped up in a nori that was deeply fried then drizzled with some sweet orange and brown sauce.  It was a huge roll and I usually don&#39;t like to eat sushi where I have to take more than 2 bites .... or maybe I just have a small mouth lol. I had better fried rolls.

I also ordered the orange roll which had semi-cooked salmon inside the nori and it was wrapped with vinegar Jap rice, topped with a layer of raw salmon and Thai chili sauce.  They should really take it easy with the sauce bc it kind of drowned the sushi and made it too sweet.

For the dessert, i ordered the green tea ice cream and loved it!  It&#39;s home made, fresh and had the right amount of sweetness but I wish they could&#39;ve given a little bit more."

This is a super picky complaint, and i won&#39;t knock them a star because it is my personal preference - i do not like the way they make egg yolk shrimp.  They put an orange under it and it really infuses the flavor.  Just not my thing.

All the food was hot. We loved the pizza. Nice crust and flavor was great!  We had cheesy garlic bread also delicious and FF were hot and yummy. The Shrimp basket and Fries was good, a lot of them but we didn&#39;t like the sauce for shrimp. Not a straight cocktail sauce so we ate them without it. Sauce was too spicy and tangy.

The driver insisted she was outside, but there clearly wasn&#39;t anyone around. Mind you, this is about 12:45 am, so we would have noticed a delivery driver outside. We never received our food.

He called them today to complain, and they took the driver&#39;s side of the discussion, even though we NEVER received our food. Aside from refunding our money, they did nothing for us to even want to try them again. Which is a shame, because we had heard good things. Good job Mug&#39;s employees.

I forget why I stopped going to Mugs and then I try them again and am reminded why I said never again. This time I&#39;ll remember. The food is ok but it&#39;s not cheap and the service sucks. They never are on time when you go to pick up an order and forget about delivery. It seems so easy to call and get food to go but it&#39;s so much easier other places. Pick up food from here if you have no life and plenty of time to waste or I guess I should plan on an hour and 15 minutes for a simple order. Ended up having to leave without my food.

I can always count on you to bring me consistently good food whenever I want it. You&#39;re the only place in my area that will deliver to me at 3:00am, and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. 

Your stuffed feta pizza forever remains in my heart. Your soups are always delivered hot for when the weather gets cold. Your chicken and pasta dinners are always delicious, reasonably priced, and well-portioned. Your au-gratin mashed potatoes are almost impossible to pass up. And since you&#39;re so generous with your portions, I&#39;m consistently stocked with leftovers so that I can enjoy your food all over again the next day.

Sure, your delivery times can be long, but I understand. You&#39;re everyone&#39;s go-to restaurant for those late drunken nights when we just want some reliably good food.

Your customer service at this location surpasses the Arlington Heights and Buffalo Grove locations. The only time I&#39;ve had a problem was when the delivery guy handed us a broken bag and my boyfriend dropped our food before returning to our apartment. You were so understanding and apologetic, and comped us for our entire order, with $5 off our next purchase. 

For as long as we live here, we&#39;ll be ordering our late night meals from you. We know you&#39;ll never let us down."

So my friends have ordered pizza and burgers from here and said it was pretty good.  I decided to give it a try.  I ordered a lot for my girlfriend and myself to sample.  Their appetizer sampler (chicken wings, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks), jalapeno poppers, more chicken wings, 1/4lb cheeseburger, &amp; rib dinner.

So there is one huge negative that made me give only 1 star.  We will get to that in a second.  To start most the food was cold.  Jalapeno poppers and mozzarella sticks had cooled down so much that the cheese was cold and hard rather than warm and soft.  The person who got the burger said it was pretty good and the wings were fine but cold.  The one thing that was hot was the rib dinner.  Their cooks obviously didn&#39;t time out the items to finish cooking near the same time.   

Now that was ok with me as the ribs were my main course and I was excited to taste them.  I eat ribs often; at least twice a month.  I&#39;ve had $10 racks of ribs from places like portillos, as well as $40 competition winning ribs from Q&#39;s restaurant in Chicago.  Now I didn&#39;t expect award winning ribs, just figured something like any normal bbq fast food joint would serve.  Well, these are literally the very worst ribs I have tasted in my entire life.  No joke I ate one bone worth and then threw the rest in the trash.  I dont know if the meat was spoiled or if the sauce was bad, but, the taste was so bad I almost threw up.

Maybe their pizzas are ok.  I&#39;ll never know because trying this place once was already once too many."

I ordered over the phone for carry out and was told 45 minutes.  It was around 11pm when I ordered.  When I got there 40 minutes I expected my pizza to be done or at least be done relatively soon.  I waited about another 15 minutes.  Not the big of a deal, but they did not seem too busy.  I also didn&#39;t see anyone wearing any food prep gloves so I am hoping every had there hands washed.  

Now onto the actual pizza.  On the phone I asked them what pizza they would recommend for a first timer.  They told me to get the Vinnie&#39;s Special.  The pizza had a ton of cheese, and it had quite a bit of veggies.  The sauce was good and the pizza was tasty.  

I also ordered some bread sticks which were lackluster.  They were practically paper thing, which wouldn&#39;t have been an issue but they were kind of hard a crispy.

The pizza was good reheated, but I would pass on the bread sticks.  

Overall I was pretty happy with Mugs.  If the pizza would have been on time and the bread sticks a little more to my liking it&#39;d get one more star."

What a mistake..  Delivery was late food was semi warm/cold..

The pizza... Was better off going to little ceasers or pizza now.  It would be a step above this place.  Ordered nothing difficult a thin crust half garlic/onion..   The sauce had no  taste, the crust was horrible tasted like raw dough, no taste in  the toppings or cheese..  Not sure if i got a bad one but this has turned me off and will not recommend this place to anybody.

I did contact grub hub  manager approved a $15 credit..  Wouldn&#39;t budge anymore..  Place with high reviews think would perform better..

With all those toppings you can order down a size because it&#39;s super filling. The medium is only $17 ish and it feeds 4-5 people. We loved their pizza so much we used them to cater two parties. Everyone loved the food! And we got sooo much there&#39;s no way it could be finished. The twice baked potatoes were the talk of the party, the ribs, beef, chicken- all delicious.

I ordered in from grub hub and got a very delicious meat lovers pizza. Very cheesy and reminds me of pizza from home (MN). Good ingredients on thin-ish crust with a nice amount of cheese, sauce and tons of meat and cut in squares!!! Honestly I only tried mugs, fratos and papa servinos so I have a small sample of Schaumburg pizza, but this was my favorite.


I also had chicken strips and they were pretty good/average chicken strips. Can&#39;t really mess up diner style chicken strips lol.

I think the crust was too thin and very soggy, the sauce was very bland, I mean very bland! The pepperoni over powered the entire taste of the pizza. The veggies inside seemed as if they were cooked way before placed in the pizza, no crunch, no taste! The cheese on the pizza was also terrible, we asked for extra cheese and adding a topping of garlic which was not even on the pizza.

Let me start with the ribs, rib tips and fried chicken have all been fine. Now to the infamous au gratin potatoes which cost $5 for a family order. When I google au gratin potatoes and search images pictures of sliced potatoes, roasted in butter, half &amp; half, diced ham and a blend of cheeses come to mind. What was delivered as au gratin potatoes from Mugs Pizza and Ribs was mashed potatoes with cheddar cheese melted on the top of them. Albeit if the potatoes were flavorful and not bland I might have went along with the whole you make potatoes your way, 99% of Americans make au gratin pictures per the Betty Crocker, Joy of Cooking and Martha Stewart way which includes slicing your potatoes on a mandolin, layering them in a casserole dish, making a cheese &amp; half &amp; half mixture and baking them for about an hour. Au gratin potatoes don&#39;t start with boiling potatoes, adding milk and mixing them with an immersion blender. 

After the potatoes were obviously wrong on so many levels Mug&#39;s customer service slid downhill from there. What are the possible remedies for fixing such a debacle? Either refund the $5, put a $5 credit for our next order and send something that resembles au gratin potatoes. None of the above was Mug&#39;s answer. You&#39;re stuck with your potatoes plain and simple. Don&#39;t like them, too bad, they&#39;re yours now. 

Customer service doesn&#39;t start with a combative attitude about subpar potatoes. Considering I&#39;ve ordered about 4 times in the past month through GrubHub to Mug&#39;s Pizza &amp; Ribs you&#39;d think they&#39;d like to retain customers. Obviously it&#39;s easier to find new customers to replace my money with. Keep at it guys. I won&#39;t be ordering from you no matter how much I like your ribs."

We&#39;ve been ordering from here the last few months and the food has been pretty good BUT they have just lost us as customers and it&#39;s not because of bad food.  My husband and I thought we&#39;d order from there 2 nights ago...  I just had a baby, it was late and I haven&#39;t had much time for myself much less time to cook. We were in the mood for Chicken Parmesan and we ordered 2 so that we&#39;d have leftovers.

The order came in ok time and I tipped the delivery guy $5 (I always try to tip decent)... Poured ourselves some drinks and sat down to eat.  I started poking around looking for the chicken asking my husband if he sees chicken and said &#34;no&#34;.  My husband looked at the menu that came with our order and said &#34;this has to be the Eggplant Parmesan&#34;... I got so frustrated because I was starving and it was late so I called to let them know.  The guy who picked up the phone had to verify with the chef and when he got back on, he said the chef DID ADMIT to making the mistake of making the eggplant parmesan instead of chicken parmesan.  WE NEVER EAT EGGPLANT!  He said he can give credit of $10 but I said we have TWO entrees which equals to just under $20 not including tax.  The guy had to put me on hold while he called his boss to see if we can get credit for both meals that THEY MESSED UP ON and after 5min on hold he came back on the phone, he said his boss said they can only give us a credit of $10 since we &#34;already have this food&#34;... are they serious??? That&#39;s so unprofessional.  I&#39;ve never heard it put like that.  We ONLY HAVE &#34;THIS&#34; FOOD BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR MISTAKE, OR, he said they can bring the 2 Chicken Parmesans but that it would be a while still because their delivery driver had just left to make other deliveries.  I said &#34;ok&#34; at first but then after hanging up, my husband said if the delivery guy just left to make other deliveries, then by the time it gets here it can be close to midnight.  So he called back and said he&#39;d just take the $10 credit and unfortunately, it&#39;s credit toward THEIR restaurant and not back on our credit card.  My husband said he&#39;ll go one day and use it.

I honestly still have 80% of the food because my husband ate around the eggplant and lost his appetite because he was also expecting chicken.  Giving the leftovers to my mom today; I hate throwing away food.  Luckily, I ordered a side of meatballs and mozzarella sticks that night too... that was my dinner.

I know what it&#39;s like to be in the restaurant business; I&#39;ve also worked at a pizza place but if I made a mistake, I make the customer 100% satisfied and make it right, not only HALF right."

And &#34;they&#34; are probably right. I know of no one who doesn&#39;t care for it; eccentricities about pizza types, crust sizes, and pick up or delivery notwithstanding.

Tonight, was a first experience with Mugs Pizza, at this location. This was the night that we used Mugs for what I call &#34;The Vigil Pizza&#34;. Sad, but true. A group of worried people, waiting at a hospital, who have had it up to the gills with cold coffee, and not even a cafeteria worker in sight.

Enter Mugs. They are open til 3:00 a.m., which was a boon to both mind and body. The cost for a fairly large sized, medium thin crust, with one topping was about $14.00. Their storefront was easy to find, clean, and smelled great. Though we didn&#39;t know it at the time, they would have delivered.

The pizza was piping hot and very good. What I liked, in particular, was that the gravy/sauce was on the spicier side, not wimpy, not regular, but with a nice kick. 

The owners were pleasant and offered extra paper products; considering where we were planning to enjoy the pizza. I have only one point. In the world of pizza, there are some that are good hot, good cold, and good hot AND cold. Mugs pizza was very good when hot, less so when cold.

But most importantly, a really great &#34;vigil&#34; pizza! Thanks!"

The ribs are also better than anything else in Schaumburg. I tried the chicken parm sandwich a few weeks ago and WOW! It has to be the best that I have had anywhere. I&#39;m sad that I will be moving soon only because Mug&#39;s will be to far for delivery. Today I ordered the egge plant parm dinner and although the portion is to big for one person that is not something to complain about. The flavor is as good as the rest of the menu.  As for that person that gave one star. Reading her review gave me insight into the kind of person that she is. Mug&#39;s you are better off with out that kind of customer. Thanks for the great food.

YUM!! and the meat was cooked just right. like other reviewers have said, the pizza is where its at. TRUTH! they have a 4 way pizza (pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, and mushrooms) which was VERY good! my husband loved it a lot. definitely adding you guys to my contacts list!!!"

The ribs and the Mug&#39;s 4 way pizza were the most intriguing things on the menu. The ribs were definitely fall off the bone and I did enjoy how they kind of had burnt edges, it had that classic rib look. The sauce was average it reminded me of a generic bbq sauce. The 4 way was a neat idea and great if you have to satisfy multiple taste. Overall the pizza was a 3/5. Id say it&#39;s a average pizza joint. Not amazing, not terrible. Just alright."

It&#39;s a taste all in its own, there isn&#39;t anything that I can compare it to. It&#39;s very unique. This particular pizza does take a while to cook, however, when you take your first bite, that wait is very well worth it. The staff is really courteous as well. I&#39;ll happily order from here again. And you can&#39;t beat that they&#39;re open until 3am..."

Sandwiches are large and very good! I&#39;ve had the Beef, Chicken Parmesan, Steak and Chicken Phillies, will definitely have them again. Great bread! Steak fries and fried Mushrooms orders are HUGE. Baked Mostacioli and meatballs are also very good. 

Chicken is OK. Ribs are OK - Neither good enough to order again for myself, but the rest of my family likes them. Nothing but good experiences so far."

Initially, I was ok with waiting quite a while for my food to be made just because it was the second or third week Mugs was open for business.   After returning a few times, I&#39;ve realized that Mugs is pretty short staffed, and waiting for food can be quite a hassle and ultimately not worth your time. I even sat next to a few people who had been there longer than I had, and they didn&#39;t seem too enthused with the wait either.

I understand that they are a new location, but several months after opening I&#39;d expect them to have the process down a little quicker. They have some pretty friendly staff members, but this just doesn&#39;t change the fact that they could run things a little smoother.

As for the food, I&#39;ve had better. Some of the pizza is pretty good, and some (like the dry barbecue chicken) just won&#39;t do it for me. The taste is what you&#39;d come to expect from your average local pizza shop. I&#39;ve also gotten some of the sandwiches and they really aren&#39;t exceptional in any way. I can&#39;t make a comment on the ribs however, because I haven&#39;t tried them, but I have heard from others that they are good. 

Overall this is just an average pizza stop, and personally I&#39;d go elsewhere for my next meal. It is definitely worth a try, because all tastes are different, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go here right away. The staff is nice, but they could try to make the food a little quicker. What is perhaps the best part about Mugs is that they are open from 3PM to 3AM, so they are a good option for late night snacking."

We ordered the hawaiin pizza and it was not worth the hour wait. For a thin crust it is too thick.  There were also whole slices of pineapples which made it hard to eat and left some slices with no pineapple on it.  It was also overwhelmed with bacon and I love bacon as much as the next person but I don&#39;t enjoy chewing that much.

After picking up the food and taking it home, I realized they forgot to give me the soup.  The chicken was so over fried to a point that I threw out half the crumbled dinner.  When I called and asked to speak to manager about the service I was basically offered to come pick up the soup.  This is just another place with bad customer service and cook with no skills."

The staff was really friendly. The inside has a classic (Greek) diner feel; you can tell it was recently remodeled as it seems really clean.  Finally, the food was very tasty. 

My son had the silver dollar kids pancake breakfast: Three pancakes and one sausage link.  The syrup came out warmed, it was delicious and plentiful for $3.99. I&#39;m not sure if a drink was included, he just had water, and I added one scrambled egg. 

I had lunch for breakfast, the combo meal: 1/2 BLT sandwich and 1/2 Cobb salad. Both were really tasty. The bacon was perfect on the sandwich, and the salad had avocado, a favorite of mine.

Not sure if they are busier at breakfast time.  Service was friendly and quick to start but after bringing our food our server disappeared and didn&#39;t come back until we were done and she was asking if we were ready for the check.  Then it took 10 minutes to bring us our check.  They were not busy at all so I&#39;m not sure what the delay was or why she disappeared during our meal.  

The food was also a disappointment.  The waffle fries, though crispy &amp; hot, tasted like they were either fried in old oil or in oil that had been used to fry a lot of fish...just didn&#39;t taste good at all.  My buffalo chicken wrap was supposed to come with dressing (I don&#39;t recall if it was blue cheese or ranch on the menu but it was definitely some sort of dressing listed) but there was none present either in the wrap or in a cup on the side.  Had our server come back to check on us or if anyone on the staff was within eyesight I would have asked for some dressing on the side to at least dip it in but alas no one was around.  Now I love me some buffalo sauce but without either blue cheese or ranch to pair with it, it&#39;s just not the same.  I&#39;d also say the size of my wrap is what I would make myself at home, something I could finish in one sitting.  Normally at a restaurant some of the wraps are huge and I take half home and based on the price they were charging for the wrap I expected it to be bigger.  Not that I needed more food...just expected more for the price to be in line with other restaurants."

Sure the hue is rancheros are excellent because they make their own beans, but if you&#39;ve ever had Chilachiles con salsa verde in Mexico City, you will taste the love in Rubio&#39;s version because it is every bit as good as what I eat when I am south of the border. Service is always cheery and handled with care while keeping my cup of coffee always full. They even have espresso.
The owners always make a point to stop by to see if everything is OK and they really mean it. They want to know that you are happy and if you&#39;re not, they will drop everything to make you the happiest customer in the restaurant.

The food is great! I have been here a few times have not been disappointed. Today, the hostess sat us quickly after arrival and was very friendly and helpful. Our waitress came quickly, served us our drinks quickly. She also gave us the perfect amount of time to wait to order, and our food came to our tables within a reasonable amount of time. Today I had the Rubio Club and it was fantastic. I ordered it with waffle fries which was a great choice! They also have a wonderful seasonal fruit selection if you decide to order fruit with your meal. Everyone was so friendly and attentive (but not overly attentive)! The coffee was also fantastic, very flavorful. My son ordered the kids macaroni and cheese and it was homemade and very cheesy, not Kraft Mac and Cheese like you get at some restaurants.

The crust is crispy, the cheese melts in my mouth, ingredients are deliciously fresh, and sauce is delectable. My palate dances with appreciation. It&#39;s the perfect blend. The garlic breadsticks are like the ones I used to eat in my childhood. If food could be described as a location, Sal&#39;s pizza would be my paradise. My husband typically thinks all pizza tastes the same (that should be a sin) but he agrees Sal&#39;s stands above the rest. You may pay slightly more, but there&#39;s truth to the quote, &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34; The service has been great too.

The far northwest burbs have a lot of pizza places, but none that I would say are worth raving about. 

Enter Sal&#39;s. It&#39;s in a nondescript location on the side of a 7-11 right at Hanson/Hilltop and 62. Their pizza is very good, and service is fast. We like both the deep dish and thin crust, usually the pies are well-done, with browned and bubbly cheese. On occasion the deep dish seems to have too much sauce, which is easily remedied by telling them to ease up on it. 

Sides and the pizza are a bit pricey, so as others have suggested, use one of the various coupons they have via mailers or their website. You don&#39;t even need to clip the coupon, just give &#39;em the coupon number and you&#39;re good. 

Sidenote: if you like hotwings, grab an order. I don&#39;t know what sauce they use, but dang it&#39;s HOT!! But good flavor too. Enjoy."

sals-pizza-company-algonquin,Peter T.,VP5wjC-QIeKvUv6_E-laBA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,91,5,wY4nAaVaijxf1h3p-ao8gg,5.0,2013-08-11,"Behind a very unassuming store front, in back of a 7-Eleven off Algonquin Road, you&#39;ll find a beehive of pizza activity. On a Friday night, I counted three adults, and a dozen teenagers (not including delivery dudes), making, baking pizzas, sandwiches, answering the phone, taking orders, waiting on walk-in customers at the counter.

After thirty years in the pizza business at a couple of different locations in Chicago, Sal packed up his family and moved to Algonquin.  He purchased a local operating pizza delivery biz in 1996, rejigged the operation, put in his family recipes, and the rest is history, as they say. Sal&#39;s is frequently listed on every &#34;best&#34; and &#34;favorite&#34; list published in the Northwest suburbs.

As I have been grazing my way through area pies, I had yet to try Sal&#39;s, and I had the opportunity last night.  Not sure if they delivered to my side of the tracks, I called in an order and was told it would be ready in 20-25 minutes.  Westbound traffic crossing the river at the end of the day is horrific under the best of circumstances, so I wasn&#39;t worried about dawdling on my way over there.

I was surprised to arrive to a full parking lot,  and an even fuller 8X8 waiting/pick up room, crammed with customers picking up pizzas, sandwiches, pasta , chicken dinners,  and food of that ilk.

I had ordered a large sausage pie and an Italian beef/sausage combo sandwich with fries. An enthusiastic teen (or six) asked if they could help me, I told them my name, order, they told me how much, and money changed hands.  They said there running a bit behind, and it would be a few minutes.

It was more than a few, but no matter, I am happy they are prospering, and they (unnecessarily) comped me a six pack of soda for the &#34;inconvenience.&#34;   I didn&#39;t really feel inconvenienced, but most every woman I have ever been involved with has told me I get &#34;this look&#34; when I reach a certain level of impatience.  I&#39;m not sure what it looks like, and it&#39;s involuntarily.  I understand that &#34;things&#34; happen in a small business.

In any case, food in my paws, along with free soda, motored home to dig into my pie.

Wow. Really. Wow.

This being Chicago, you have a pizza place on practically every corner (right next to the hot dog/beef shop), and that&#39;s not even including the national chains.

Sal&#39;s deserves all the accolades its receives.  And your business.

With a flaky, chewy thin crust, flavorful sauce, and handsome sized pieces of hand-pulled Italian sausage, and a very generous serving of real cheese, this is a great pizza.

As you know, I think the true test of a good pizza is how it works out for breakfast the next morning, having sat on the counter all night, and Sal&#39;s passes with flying colors.

Good job, folks. I&#39;ll be back."

Order: Take Out
Lasagna w/Meat Sauce
Mozzarella Sticks w/Marinara Sauce

Pros: I really enjoyed the lasagna. It was nice and cheesy and had plenty of sauce. I initially ordered the cheesy bread sticks instead of the mozzarella sticks but unfortunately they were out. I will definitely be trying those on my next visit.

Cons: There were not many negatives from what I ordered but if I had to nitpick I would say the sauce was a little oily.

Very good pizza (never tried anything else). My Niece and Nephew know how to order gut-buster pizzas (I am adventurous only as far as adding mushrooms to my pepperoni pizza). I don&#39;t even know what all they get on it, but it is the MOST FABULOUS (non-Gino&#39;s) pizza I have ever had.

Except that they ordered it up by their house near Waukegan and ... different place, same FABULOUS pizza. Maybe no one can screw up their gut-buster order? Maybe it has magical qualities ... no, that can&#39;t be it.

Anywho, very, very, very good pizza. The joint is behind the convenience store (which, another fun fact, used to be a White Hen). Pickup and delivery only."

Sal&#39;s uses a generous helping of cheese, and the sauce is rich and flavorful. It&#39;s helpful that Sal&#39;s has an extra-large (18 inch) pizza available -- many places don&#39;t carry that size. 

I recently ordered four pizzas to feed a small group. Everyone loved it. I particularly liked the veggie pizza, which had spinach, garlic, tomatoes and mushrooms.

In the 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s used to go to Old World Pizza in downtown, It used to be some of the best thin crust I ever had. Then in late 90&#39;s it changed hands. Ever since then, I have been trying to find a reasonable substitute and I have tried many pizza places in Chicago area with no luck. I knew something was up when I went to go pick up my pizza and the place was rockin and rolling busy! My search has finally ended! This is to me I think better than I remember Old World! I cannot believe that this jem has slipped by me all these years. I am wondering if this place is the reason why the original owner of Old World sold his business! Thin crust pizza was perfect, Sauce is some of the best I have ever had (and I usually do not like pizza sauce), but what really killed it was the Sausage, seems like someones home made or custom made recipe.

From all the little mom&amp;pop places i have tried in chicago, moving to the suburbs was a pizza challenge.  After trying many many different pizza&#39;s in and around the algonquin area i have FINALLY found one that i love.  

Sal&#39;s pizza is EXACTLY the type of pizza i would find in the heart of the city.  
It&#39;s the best i have found in the suburbs and i order from there on a weekly basis.  Thier pizza is not cracker thin, but a nice thin crust.  The sauce is nice and rich and i;ve never had a dry pizza.  The cheese is put on by the handfuls, loads of cheese.  If you ordered from another pizza joint you would have to order extra cheese to get this much.  I think the main thing that sets them apart is after the pizza is done cooking they have a warming cart where they put the pizzas till they are picked up or ready for delivery.  In this warming box, the cheese gets time to settle and not run off the pizza.  

This is a tiny hole in the wall and its carry out/delivery only but i love it.  i have had catered events from them and the food was AMAZING as well.  from the broasted chicken to the homade italian beef, it was great.

I HIGHLY suggest this place to anyone looking for some authentic chicago style pizza."

Craving for some Asian comfort food for Sunday lunch, I was planning to have some congee and dim sum at Minghin but left there because of the long wait. Thanks Yelp for finding Umacamon for me.

Umacamon has a fast food kinda setup, where you order and pay at the counter when walking in, and get a number. The waitress will deliver the food to your table. The place is spacious and clean. 

I had the Chanpon noodle. It was delicious. Flavorful soup, decent portion of seafood and pork, and just the right amount of vegetables and noodle. Ingredients are fresh. They grilled the toppings before adding to the noodle soup so it added another layer of rich flavor and aroma. Yum!

Service was good. Being a fan of Japanese ramen, I asked the cashier/waitress if they have it, she told me they offer two kinds of ramen at dinner time and patiently explained to me the dinner hours etc.

There are also other great options here like a variety of Japanese curry rice dishes that I&#39;m also interested in. I&#39;ll definitely go back."

The food:  Big *ss sushi.  Almost loose.  On the edge of loose.  Rice saves it.  Rice is glue.  Uma&#39;s rice has a perfect vinegar balance.  Sushi taste?  Very, tasty.

Doro Takoyaki (octopus ball): Wherever I go, I always try takoyaki. It was average.
Age Mochi Butter (mochi in sauce): I was very excited to try this as I love mochi and I love butter. It was good but very salty. I would order it again.
Gyu Suji (beef tendon) - they ran out. 
Fish Sashimi (small) - was ok.
Kyu Motsu Karaage (fried beef intestine) - I was looking forward to this. I would&#39;ve liked it better if it was more crispy.
Seafood with Butter Soy Sauce - tasted ok but very boring.

Lunch service: order at the register like you would at a Cosi&#39;s or Panera, you&#39;ll receive a number card, and you decide where you want to sit for the staff to bring your order.  Regular lunch menu items consists of mostly curry rice dishes, rolls, and sashimi. In addition to the regular lunch menu, there&#39;s the daily value meal.  So far we&#39;ve tried the Monday Tonkastu (pork cutlet) value meal, lots of food on that one plate but delicious and tender. The Philly sandwich is messy to eat but yummy as well. 
 
Dinner service: restaurant with a wait staff and there&#39;s more variety in the menu.  We love the seafood skewers, the meat is tender and nicely seasoned. We&#39;re definitely coming back for the takoyki.  It&#39;s so yummy and surprisingly filling! 

Staff is friendly and helpful with questions regarding their food.  

Umacamon&#39;s food is reasonably priced and kudos to the kitchen staff!"

I looked at their menu and loved that they had the rice bowl with the fish on top, it looked very authentic! I got the salmon with ikura don (rice bowl), it was good, but I&#39;ve had better salmon. The real reason for the two stars is for the small curry bowl that I got. I&#39;ve had Japanese curry many times, including in Japan, so I know what it should taste like....and this was not it.  Although I got it as a take out order, I still expect that the food I am getting should be given to me as you would serve it to me in the restaurant....ie it shouldn&#39;t be ice cold as though it just came out of the refrigerator! It wasn&#39;t even remotely warm, it was cold which I think is unacceptable."

The salad for the appetizer was very nice. It has a light dressing that tasted of vinegar, ginger and peanuts. 

The salmon ikura bowl is so delicious. The rice was seasoned nicely. The salmon just melted in your mouth and the ikura tasted so fresh. This is how the salmon and roe should taste. 

The rice casserole lacked seasoning, but it had a nice creamy flavor and they didn&#39;t skimp on the cheese. Cheese makes everything better.

For the pork cutlet, the curry tasted very rich and the pork cutlet was fried perfectly.

I think the staff needs more training. There were only 4 tables to wait on and the waitress was confused where the order was supposed to go even though we had a number. The lady behind the register needs to be more friendly.

I will be coming back again though. I&#39;m looking forward to their dinner menu."

I have visited twice; once for lunch, once for dinner.  At lunch, I had a tuna-hamachi don with soup and salad.  The portions of sashimi in the bowl were generous, fresh, and tasty.  This will be a good summertime lunch.

At dinner, they served the best Okonomi Yaki I ever had. The portion is big (about 8 inches across), so unless you have a serious appetite, plan to split that with at least one other person.  Inside were pork and seafood (shrimp, octopus, and little scallops), cooked to perfect tenderness, on top were the traditional squiggles of sauce, pickled ginger, and the dancing fish flakes.  The complex flavors had a pleasantly spicy zing.

Shortly after the Okonomi Yaki arrived, they served the Yakitori we ordered. We tried chicken thighs, ground chicken, and bacon-wrapped asparagus. (Yes, we had a vegetable!)  The smoky flavor of the meats was excellent, and they were served hot and moist.  The bacon-wrapped asparagus will even make converts of vege-phobes.  

Together, the Okonomi Yaki&#39;s zing and the smoky meat favors provided a nice contrast.  We did not have room for dessert.

The portions and service allow you to order several dishes, as you might order sushi or tapas.  This allows you to enjoy a favorite and try something unfamiliar.

I am looking forward to returning soon."

However, this was the most horrendous part. I ordered gyoza and two tuna rolls. The gyoza was covered in an ectoplasm-like substance that stuck all of the dumplings together and tasted of mucus. The tuna rolls were edible, luckily.

I was excited to order off the menu immediately. There were so many options and the menu is generously priced. 

We split an order of the Doro Takoyaki (Fried octopus ball w/ spicy Doro sauce) and they were amazing! Well seasoned and they were topped with Katsuobushi (dried tuna flakes)

I had ordered a Pork Belly skewer and the Garlic Beef Don. The pork skewers were well cooked and were a good size. Very delicious. The garlic beef bowl had plenty of food for its price. It was filled to the top with marinated beef, which was very tender, some tomato and carrot. Also delicious.

I will definitely be back, hopefully soon. This looks like it may become one of my go-to spots for dinner. The staff is VERY friendly and the food came out pretty quickly. The restaurant is a hidden gem in my eyes and I hope to come back one day when it is full of patrons. They deserve the business.

The food is too authentic for the restaurant interior atmosphere, which is very open space and modern. It&#39;s like serving country fried steak at a night club, which is kinda odd.

As a customer who originated in Asia and have visited more multicultural parts in the States and Canada, I can link my experience with the food, and it&#39;s pretty authentic and decent, this is why I am giving it 5 stars, as my own experience. I can also tolerate the weird atmosphere, I guess so can the Japanese business men that filled the restaurant on my visits.

Therefore, I would recommend people to try this place if they have the same background as I do, and for the others, this will be an experience that&#39;s new, but not necessary better."

It&#39;s definitely a sit down restaurant and not a take out restaurant. Trust me your food will taste a lot better.

It kind of have a nice over the top Japanese theme, but the staff is really nice. Or at least the waitress and bus boy that we had were.

Food was very tasty. We just had the Ramen and Udon Noodle with stuffed chicken wing. I would recommend coming with a small group. The only thing I though was lacking was maybe a bigger Sushi Menu. However, I think since Sushi is not their focus and Japanese Cuisine (hench why I think the name is Japanese Kitchen and not Umacamon Sushi)."

We did take out and we probably won&#39;t be back. Decor a feel of the place was good, the young man that helped us pick out our food was very helpful by showing us pictures of the food on his ipad. 

We received all of our order, chopsticks, sauces- everything to enjoy our meal was in the bag. However. we didn&#39;t really enjoy the food. We ordered the garlic beef, bacon asparagus, extra rice for $1, and the salmon &amp; tuna rice (came w/ miso soup). The total was about $30. I understand this is similar to tapas in the portions, so it&#39;ll always be kind of expensive for the amount of food you get, but here&#39;s the breakdown. 

Bacon asparagus. 2 pieces- not worth the money at all. They weren&#39;t the best pieces of asparagus- my husband actually removed the last portion of his bite and threw it into the trash- and let me tell you he eats EVERYTHING. I knew it was bad then. The bacon wasn&#39;t fully cooked. Just a disappointing dish. 

Garlic Beef was very chewy (and I thought the pieces were too big too). The citrus sauce that came with it wasn&#39;t too bad though. 

Salmon &amp; Tuna over sticky rice- quite good. This was the best part of the meal. However, for the price. We&#39;d much rather head to Nikko Sushi spend nearly the same amount and get a full platter of sushi to share, with complimentary salad, miso soup and a sweet treat at the end of the meal. 

Glad we tried it, so that we know we won&#39;t be back."

Wait! Phone etiquette, I called to change our reservation time, was greeted w &#34;hello&#34;, thought I had called someone&#39;s cell phone. 

Uhmm.....we had to go over the food items a few times for her to find it on the iPad, she needs to know the names n the menu better, finally we ordered by item numbers :)
It&#39;s a very casual dining, can&#39;t be too picky. Let it slide. 

Food is pretty decent, but I was a little hesitant, sensing some inexperience in back of the house too. 
One of my 2 oysters was very &#34;sandy&#34;, it was gross w all that sand grinding between my teeth. Server said, she would give me 50% off, duh, I very unladylikely spit out the oyster into the napkin at the table, I should not have to pay for it. I should be compensated for looking so unsophisticated. Oh, n also, they need to loosen the oyster from the shelf before they baked it, it was hard to eat, the oyster was stuck to the shelf. 

Told a server we need more dressing for our cabbage, he never came back :(
Beef tongue was cut different thickness and size. N it felt like someone has forgotten to put seasoning on it. 

Ok ok be nice, say something nice. 
Most of the skewers were good. 
We had may be close to 30 skewers. There&#39;s not one that we thought we didn&#39;t like, but it did come to mind of what it&#39;s like in the kitchen. 
Konyaku skewer
Chicken w mentaiko
Chicken w ume
Ume shiso meat
Okura w meat
Tsukune
Gizzard
Chicken soft bone, thou they cheated by adding chicken in between
Mushroom 
Yaki Onigiri were good, big, it might be better if it&#39;s w soy sauce. 
Pickle daikon was good 
The sticky potato was interesting.
Aji sashimi was good but server had shown us a picture that look very different, skip the picture if it&#39;s not the same fish. 

It feels like they need some work, especially the front of the house. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they are very nice but need some training. 

Give them some time to fine tune. 
I do recommend to give it a try. 
We will come back too."

One party was waiting before us. We saw there were at least three tables vacant, probably more, but we understood it was a busy time. After 20 minutes later, the previous party got finally seated. We were the only party still waiting. A waitress came out to tell us that they would need a little more time to clean a table, so we were waiting. Another 10 minutes had passed, yet no waiter cleaned those vacant tables. Nor, any waiter including the one who talked with us didn&#39;t even give us a quick glance. Being ignored too long, we didn&#39;t see it would happen anytime soon that we would be seated. We just gave up and left. No waiter realized we did because they didn&#39;t really care.

The Motsu-nabe, (Beef intestine hot pot) was extremely flavorful and delicious.  Unfortunately, the tonkotsu ramen  was very bland and oilly.  The soup had no flavor and noodles were sub par.  

As for the service, it took too long.  It took us 40 min to receive chicken grilled on a stick. I am sure the staff just needs more training and time to adjust their operations. We will go back again in a few months.  Look forward to improved service!"

We knew this place was new and wanted to try it!  Staff was friendly and they assisted us on the menu...wide variety of apps, small plates and rice dishes.  My only wish is that they had a kids menu.  My son tried to eat some noodles, rice and katsu pork but it took a bit for him to eat it.  A nice customer service move was they had gotten my husbands order wrong so we got a bowl of ramen on the house.  We ordered the mini curry bowl with pork, pork katsu, spicy tuna roll and grilled quail egg skewer.  We will definitely be back BC we want to try more grilled items!  Definitely worth checking out"

Our server was very friendly and very patient with us while we asked her questions about the establishment and food.

Had lunch here today and I was not impressed. I had the chicken sandwich which was just okay. It wasn&#39;t awful but it wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. My fries tasted like frozen fries that were popped in the oven. They were cold in the center.

The place itself was pretty dirty. Lots of cobwebs...maybe it was decor for Halloween. The waitress was nice but not very attentive. I asked for extra napkins for the table and she only brought me one. There were four of us at the table. Should I have just split the napkin? 

I would not come back to this place. The lack of cleanliness was a turnoff."

In warmer weather their porch is perfect.  It overlooks the Fox River and the bike path.   They have great Spanish/Mexican influenced breakfast staples.  My absolute favorite are the Enchilada Breakfast Crepes.  Their Mexican omelets and eggs benedict are delicious too.  Portion sizes are hefty for the small price tag.  Their hash-browns are a must as well.  They always come out super crispy which is how I like them.  

I have not had anything off their lunch/dinner menu, but everything I have tried for breakfast exceeds my expectations.  It is also great to support small, family businesses in Batavia."

They have a lot in the way of vegetables and fruits in the menu items, which is greatly appreciated.  One of us almost always orders something with avocado, and another fav is choosing one of their home-made breads made as french toast - most recently it was their banana bread french toast, with fresh sliced bananas and pecans over the top, with sausage links, and eggs for eight bucks...tough to beat that quality or price around here.

My husband and I went there this past Friday, other than the two of us there was one other table.  My husband and I always pass this place on our bike ride along the fox river and have been wanting to try it so we finally had the chance.  I don&#39;t know what the inside looks like since we walked straight onto the deck and were seated.  The deck was nice and I thought we were going to have an enjoyable breakfast... I was wrong!  

It all started when I asked for a tomato juice with a lemon and was served a glass of tomato juice that tasted like a tin can and a lemon that looked like it was sitting on the counter for two days (dry and old).  It was 10am so it was an old, old lemon slice not sliced that morning for certain.   I told the waitress the juice did not taste right and instead of asking if I wanted something else I was told she just opened the can and it was fresh, and that it is fine.   Needless to say I said I would be fine with water.

When I went to order I asked if the bacon was made fresh and was told &#34;that all the people love their bacon&#34;  I asked again if it was made fresh or if it was bought premade and just heated and was told &#34;yes&#34;.  I skipped the bacon and just asked for two eggs, hash browns, and toast.  

As my breakfast was served I took one bite of my hash browns and when I went for a second bite a short black hair was in the hash browns.  I put it to the side and planned to skip the hash browns and just eat the eggs and toast.  I wasn&#39;t going to say anything given I had just complained about the juice and lemon and didn&#39;t want to be difficult. BUT As I cut into the eggs and placed it on my fork the egg turned upside down and on the backside of the egg was two more short black hairs.  At this time I had enough and brought it to the wait staffs attention.  I was met with an argumentative response with her telling me they were not hair that they were potato&#39;s.  I told her I know what hair looks like andI also cook and know what a potato looks like.  She insisted that they were not hairs and that the cook wears a hair net!  It was crazy!   She then backed off her explanation that they were potato&#39;s but still insisted they weren&#39;t hairs.  I told her since she can&#39;t tell me what they are, and they are not food, I don&#39;t want the entree.  After many times of her telling me they weren&#39;t hairs she asked if I wanted another order.  I told her I would not.  

My husband was afraid to eat his dish but didn&#39;t want to cause more issues so ate.  He said his dish was not a good dish to judge the place on because it was a healthy egg beaters breakfast sandwich was very tasteless and dry but he attributes that to it being healthy.  

I would never go back!"

We were welcomed and felt right at home. The food was made to order and came out quickly. We brought in a large group and everything went perfectly. The space was clean, bright and colorful. Surprising and cozy for a small strip mall taqueria, it was a nice place run by friendly, enthusiastic staff. It&#39;s a little hard to find, without street-side signage, but it&#39;s in the middle of Harper Plaza strip mall where there&#39;s plenty of parking.

Horchata was homemade, and very good. The guacamole was chunky with tomato, onion, and cilantro. Chips were light and airy, fresh and served hot. Pretty much perfect. I had the pork guisado special, which was delicious. Tender meat that fell off the bone, in a spicy, savory red sauce. The steak taco I had was seasoned well and had a soft texture. Really good. Others liked the pozole special, veggie burrito, steak torta, and al pastor tacos. 

They mentioned they hired a new cook and will be expanding the menu soon in a few weeks. 
Really a gem in the area, authentic Mexican is seemingly hard to find around here, but we&#39;ll be making this our #1 spot from now on."

The small strip mall they are in has not traditionally done well. Most businesses and all of the restaurants that opened there have not lasted. The problem with this location is the entrance/exit. The plaza sits on the north side of Algonquin Road, just west of Roselle Road. Turning left into the lot if you are driving east is virtually impossible at rush hour. Likewise, leaving the lot can be frightening going either way.

It is larger on the inside than it appears it would be. The restaurant is really well decorated. They have one big open room with tables and TVs. They have a section cordoned off between the big room and the counter where they have a large party table. I went there for take-out and no other patron was there at the time so I&#39;m not sure if they wait the tables or if you order all meals at the counter.

There was one person taking orders and working the register, and one cooking. I ordered something simple, a Carne Asada Burrito. They make it fresh and it came out pretty quickly. After thanking them and wishing them the best, I took my dinner home.

The Burrito is made similarly to Chipotle. They are quite large and stuffed mainly with rice. The meat was good. They don&#39;t put salsa in the Burrito, but they do give you fresh salsa to take with you. The salsa was fresh but mild. The rice was a litte overcooked and sticky. All in all, though, it was tasty and it was fresh.

Next time, I want to dine in. At that point, I will updated my review."

Will definitely be coming back for more! I couldn&#39;t get enough. Started off with tacos, followed by a burrito with guacamole and lastly flautas! Crispy and delicious!

We went last night and we were very pleased. It is authentic Mexican cuisine. Very friendly service by the owners. It&#39;s a family business that they started for a 5 year old nephew. He couldn&#39;t go to work with them at their jobs and they didn&#39;t want him with a babysitter on the weekends. So he can come to work with them and be with his family. 

They are adding new dishes in slowly. They like to make sure they all like it before they introduce it to the public. The salsa was great. They have a tomatillo salsa that is very unusual and one owner told me it was his mother&#39;s recipe. 

It comfortable and pleasant in there. They keep saying they want people to feel at home; grab a soda out of the refrigerator and find a seat. Here&#39;s hoping the word spreads and this restaurant will be around for a long time!!"

I wandered in at 11am on a Sunday and they were just opening up. I met Silvino (one of the brothers) who is very friendly and went out of his way to make my meal excellent.  Everything here is made fresh. They serve white corn tortilla chips that are fried to order and almost taste like friend flour tortillas because they are so light. These are served with a classic salsa and  unique tomatillo salsa. Ask for specials because they are always doing something different. Today it was Posole (Mexican chicken soup). Silvino let me try a small bowl first since I had never heard of it. It was so good I ordered it as a meal.  He always roasted some small chile peppers for me to add spice. It was so flavorful with softened white corn kernels (hominy) and comes with a side of cabbage, radishes, limes and fresh cut onions. I had some flan for dessert and it was perfect - with a slight curd and not too sweet. I&#39;ll be back to try the mole enchiladas and chile rellenos. They are also going to start making tamales in the future. Tell your friends - this place is a gem! They opened in the Summer of 2016 and are  co-owned by Silvino and his brother. They are out to make it on their own after many jobs in other industries including management in a large, corporate food service chain. Yes - support a local business."

Excellent customer service and my food was delicious. I stopped in after collecting coupon after coupon from the Cougars games. This location just recently opened up and it&#39;s the nearest to me. I got gas at the gas station, checked out the liquor store and then bought my lunch. 

The menu has apps, sides, wings,burgers, sandwiches and salads. My coupon was buy a main and make it a meal for free. After much thought taking in the menu, I settled on the BLT. It has avocado on it, which caught my eye. I got it on wheat bread, which they toasted just right and plenty of fresh lettuce and tomato plus a gentle amount of mayo, the avocado and the main star of the sandwich, the bacon! It was perfectly done, just thick enough and in between crispy and chewy. The sandwich was top notch. I chose tater tots as my side, who doesn&#39;t love tater tots!?!?!? These were crunchy and potatoey. Yum! Finally, I got a diet coke. It rivals McDonald&#39;s quality. It came from a small version of those computerized soda machines, and it had the exact amount of carbonation needed for a quality pop. 

I loved my experience. I will go back, I just hope I can try something new, but the BLT is calling my name."

The reviews of the Aurora location impressed me and once I saw a positive review posted for this location, I decided to give Urban Counter a try.

It is located right next to the BP gas station at Bricher &amp; IL Route 38. I&#39;m sure at some point I will combine feeding me and feeding my car into one trip.

I&#39;m a simple basic kind of guy and I like the style of this place. Not fancy or pretentious. Functional sort of industrial-looking furniture. Could see the grill from the counter. I made a take-out order, and it took maybe 5-6 minutes from placing my order to it being ready. I didn&#39;t time it. Yes, it took longer than McDonald&#39;s/BK/Wendy&#39;s, but I got a better product that was made-to-order and wasn&#39;t thrown together. Worth the wait.

For my first visit, I went with the Bacon Burger and a regular-sized order of fries. The burger was very good. The thick half-pound patty comes with bacon, barbecue sauce, onion rings, cheddar, and roasted jalapenos. As I was eating it, I had forgotten about the jalapenos and was wondering where the spicy kick came from. They were a nice touch. Better than the raw pickled jalapenos you might get on a burger elsewhere. Sauce was good, onion rings were good. The bacon didn&#39;t overwhelm the burger. The flavors were balanced. The burger was well-constructed. I was worried such a big burger might fall apart and be a mess to eat, but it all stayed together right down to the last bite.

There were two things I liked about the hand-cut fries. They were lightly salted with a larger-grained salt. So many places oversalt their fries so badly that my tongue feels assaulted. Not with these fries. They were a nice change. I also liked that the fries weren&#39;t limp and greasy. One Italian beef place I used to go to sells hand-cut fries that are so greasy and go totally limp if you don&#39;t eat them in 5 minutes. Urban Counter&#39;s fries were still nice and crispy after a 10-minute car ride.

I&#39;ve been wanting a place where I can grab a good burger for lunch that&#39;s a step up from the usual fast food places, offers good value, and has the kind of ambiance/convenience I like. I think Urban Counter is it, and I look forward to trying the rest of the menu."

The behind the counter could use some help. The sweet potato fries are mushy ( like the Fryer fat wasn&#39;t hot enough) and some were so dried out that they seemed burned. The Choc shake was like wipped milk with chocolate, not creamy thick. 
Not sure why the cup for the milkshake said &#34; Pride&#34; on it. Are they owned by the Pride wine store next door or did they just run out of plastic cups? The people at the register seem tired and the people at the grill frustrated. The burgers are good. 
The biggest problem is that they close at 7pm on Friday and Saturday nights! When we were there Saturday 3 people walked in a couple minutes after 7 because no one locked the door, and they told them sorry they were closed! This place won&#39;t last unless they get a clue!
Hope they do

Love their buffalo chicken salad and wings. With that said the place seems to be getting empty in recent months I have to put this down to the kitchen and service. Take tonight for example:
- Entree made incorrectly so delayed while others eat. They remake it incorrectly again so it is delayed further.
- Bill came with overcharge on it, and had to request it be corrected
- Needed to request refills
- 2 credit cards were used for separate checks. One was processed with full amount to it, then reprocessed with the amounts flipped between the credit cards. Requested correction.

Place needs a service manager to oversee these issues, the restaurant could have at least comp&#39;d the entree and some places would have done more. Instead they have lost a long time customer as this has become the standard as of late. I assume others have caught on to these issues sooner hence why it is so empty... How much has changed since I first went here and there would be long waits for dinner and a packed house."

I saw an ad for Thursdays $3 burgers and thought it was a really good deal, but then I thought there had to be a catch... but I risked it anyway since I haven&#39;t been there in so long. Whyyy not!

It was pretty empty when we walked in... but after we ordered, it started filling with some people.

We were starving so we ordered 2 burgers, nachos, and 12 inch veggie pizza. We weren&#39;t even gonna get the pizza but LEFTOVERS!! And we used to loooveeee this pizza.

After waiting and waiting and watching people around us get food, our nachos and pizza come out. Idk what took so long, it wasn&#39;t busy when our order was taken.

When you order an appetizer, you want it to come out first, right? So you can munch on it while you&#39;re waiting for your food. Well, the nachos and pizza came out together, then 5 seconds later, our burgers. Wth?

Some of the nachos were burnt on the edges and super salty. It was cold. I did like the crispness of some of the chips, even though some seemed over salted. It seemed homemade, but that&#39;s about it. I think this was $11-$12, not worth it.

The pizza was cold and undercooked and raw. The cheese was melted and the crust was mostly cooked.. but all of the veggies in it were not cooked. Which is usually ok, but not ok for the onions. They gave off an unpleasant, sharp (spicy?), raw flavor that ruined the whole thing. The pizza is not the same as it used to be. So disappointing... not worth the $20 for the 12 inch pizza, at all!!

Now our burgers. First off, it&#39;s $3 build your own burgers, not just $3 burgers. The ad made it sound like &#34;you just pick whatever burger you want and it&#39;s $3!&#34;  But nope, literally everything costs extra. Only things that weren&#39;t were mayo, mustard, ketchup, &amp; something else. I forgot. I figured it&#39;s still ok. It will still be a decent price for a 1/2lb burger even with extra toppings and sides, which range from $.10- $1.99. I think our burgers came out to like ~$7, which is far from the $3, but EVERYTHING is extra.... the sides were $1.99 each.

So I got a med rare with provolone, jalapeños, tomatoes, onions, bacon, and onion rings. The person I was with got med well with pepper jack, tomatoes, onions, sauteed mushroom, bacon, and sweet potato fries. They were both cold and overcooked. The onion rings were soggy and all stuck together, the sweet potato fries were soggy and chewy. Idk how that even happens.

I think our order was just sitting there for a long time. Everything was cold. Idk what the problem was. People around us were getting food before us when they came in and ordered after we did. 

The girl serving us was nice, but she did not smile at all. She looked miserable, like she didn&#39;t want to be there. I felt bad for her, actually... 

This place has just become a place where you can go when you&#39;re drunk and eat whatever because when you&#39;re drunk, everything tastes good. Umm... pretty much bar food, but it&#39;s kinda expensive and not worth it. 

I&#39;m sad to say, I won&#39;t be going back :("

For starters, we ordered our appetizer and then had to flag down our server to take our order as well as bring silverware. She then asked us if we&#39;d like another round of drinks, we ordered some and then sat staring at the drinks sitting at the bar from our booth for the past 5 minutes, we flagged down our server (again) and asked her to please bring us our drinks she apologized and then bought us our drinks where one of them wasn&#39;t the correct drink that we had initially ordered, she apologized again and brought it back. 

Finally, our food came and we were so excited to eat but unfortunately we had ordered a burger, and she brought us a sandwich? It was strange because she took the temperature and everything for the burger. 
Also, we ordered a chicken sandwich and the sandwich had so much salt on it, i took one bite and was not interested in anymore. 
Overall, it just seemed to be a very overwhelming night for her, and the restaurant seemed short staffed because everyone was running around with dirty dishes sitting on tables. 

If we do decide to return, hopefully it is more staffed so that certain servers aren&#39;t overwhelmed. 

The three stars are for the server being so apologetic!"

We took the kids for dinner on a Saturday night around 5ish, before it became a true &#34;bar&#34;. While much of the clientele was couples there were a few other families there but I could tell this was just during the early dinner hours and they probably wouldn&#39;t be there had it been later. 

We order a XL half sausage pizza and an order of potato skins. Both were very good and served in a reasonable amount of time. Lots of TVs in every direction so the we could watch the college football game of our choice. 

The atmosphere was a little loud which is fine for me but the husband found it a little hard on his ears. 

I would definitely return for pizza, both with or without kids. I&#39;d also recommend to families but I would suggest an earlier dinner."

We arrived abt 12 so the place was empty, I was a little scared by that but we got seated anyway. The place looks AMAZING!!!! I thought it was a new structure definitely didn&#39;t think it was 10yrs old. I believe the server was Alex (only 1 working) he was a cool dude! We ordered a 12in Garbage pizza, with 6 wings.

Attentive, despite how busy they were, and well-staffed.  And, thankfully, no more server running off with my phone to get approval on a Yelp check-in offer. Yay!  I wish I could remember the girl&#39;s name who served us last night as she was so sweet and really busting her butt to keep all her tables happy.

And they DO have a printed beer/drink list! Bonus points to them for having it printed double-sided so two people who are sitting across from each other can hold it up and peruse the offerings at the same time.  If your server doesn&#39;t give you one, just ask.

Everything we&#39;ve tried here on the menu has been good.  Our favorite is the Buffalo Stampede platter (combo of wings, boneless wings &amp; shrimp &amp; you can choose 3 different sauces - they have a lot of sauces to choose from) and the fried veggie combo platter (onion rings, shrooms &amp; zucchini).  Their fried veggies are house-made and definitely NOT frozen.  Their batter reminds me of what my Mom would make when she&#39;d fry us up a big batch of zucchini in the Summer - so good.  If you&#39;ve only had the pre-made frozen then fried veggies you really should give Jersey&#39;s fresh version a try.  Their thin-crust pizza is good as well and they have quite a few specialty pizzas to choose from in addition to create-your-own. Our fave pizza is the A La Vodka one - that sauce is amazing, perfectly seasoned with lots of great peppers &amp; sausage, and the crust is really good as well.

They place is big and loud (of course, it&#39;s a sports bar!) so it&#39;s good for both large and small groups.  They play the game audio (at least for the Blackhawks, I&#39;ve never been to there to watch any other local sports teams) and they have many TV&#39;s (large &amp; medium) around so no matter where you sit you can catch the action."

I order a Turkey Club which came with potato chips. The middle of the sandwich was about an inch thick with turkey, which is a lot more turkey than I normally get on a Turkey Club.

The second time I ate Jersey Pizza with my wife and we ordered a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It took approximately 20 minutes. It had quite a lot of chicken and the hot sauce was just right, not overwhelmingly hot. It also had a lot of red onion. I am not a big fan of red onion, but a lot of other people like red onion."

My first impression is that it was pretty clean and the decor was very modern. The chairs at the bar were comfy (a rare thing it seems) and there were TVs everywhere, including a giant projector screen at the bar.

Being that it was around 5-6pm, I expected it to be pretty crowded, but it was mostly dead. There were a few families and parties there, but it was nice to have the &#34;elbow room&#34; without a ton of loud mouths around.  There was a good mix of music playing (70s, 80s, 90s, metal, alternative, etc.) until someone got hold of the jukebox and played gangsta rap for the next 2 hours. Still, I thought it was better than listening to some sports game over the loud speaker and the volume wasn&#39;t so bad, it was easy to have a conversation and actually hear one another.

The beer was a little higher than other places I&#39;ve visited, $5.50 for a 16oz IPA, and $5 for Angry Orchard. (I usually pay that for a 32 oz.) The prices for sandwiches and other items was a bit higher than average. My friend and I ordered the chili con queso appetizer and agreed, it was very good.  We ran out of chips as it was a huge bowl of dip and the server brought us a fresh batch at no extra charge. The chips were delish! Light, crispy, very salty and perfect just the way I like them - and I&#39;m quite picky about that.

We went with a 16&#34; thin crust pizza, as we ended up taking half of it home.  We had the spinach and tomato - it was really tasty! I was pleasantly surprised. It had a lot of cheese and just the right amount of other toppings, it was cooked perfectly and golden brown.  The crust was crispy around the edges.  I felt for the price, it was worth it.

We like to play trivia and most often play in other establishments. There were at least 5 TVs at the (empty) bar, so we asked if trivia could be put on one of the small ones by us.  That request was met with a &#34;well - let me see if he&#39;ll do it - he&#39;s kind of cranky about changing the TV stations.&#34;  Really?  We had the Sox game on 7 TV&#39;s, including the big screen in front of us and the bar was completely empty except for us.  They did end up changing it, about 3 questions into the game (it took 15 minutes to get the channel changed and a game box - after I asked twice).  Later, someone else asked if they could get the basketball game on another TV and were met with the same hesitant attitude.  So let me get this right.  There are TVs absolutely everywhere in this place, like enough for every table to have their choice of a game on each one... and we get attitude for changing the station (especially when it was dead?)  I wasn&#39;t too impressed with that.

Parking was easy and the lot seemed big enough to accommodate even if it were full. We stayed for several hours and it never filled up at all beyond what it was when we walked in.

The service was a bit slow to my liking, considering how few people were there and 2 bartenders on staff. However, the people seemed friendly enough (except the manager - who didn&#39;t say a word to anyone and complained about changing the TV station).

Overall - I would definitely visit again to play trivia and share a pizza if I were in the area.  If I&#39;m looking for a place to catch my favorite game and/or drink more than a couple craft or IPA beers, I&#39;d go elsewhere."

In addition to continually delicious food (we are all about the boneless wings with classic sauce and lots of bleu cheese dressing), I haven&#39;t had any issues with incorrect / missing food, and the staff at the front (register / taking orders / hostesses) are always friendly and helpful.  (They helped me figure out I should order the celery on the side, so it doesn&#39;t get cooked riding home with the wings!)

We&#39;ve also eaten in at least twice since my last review, and in spite of it being super busy one of those times, the service and food were great.  Overall, I&#39;d definitely recommend Jersey&#39;s if you&#39;re interested in sports, beer, wings, and pizza.  :)"

No others fans but us were there :-( I know the restaurant has nothing to do with that, so let the review commence...

We had a Groupon, $17 for a 16&#39; specialty pizza and two drinks, beer included. A+ for the Groupon. It was a great deal. We got the taco pizza and two Blue Moons.  We also ordered onion rings and Boneless Wings. We got spicy garlic, eh, they were edible, that&#39;s about it. We also got honey chipotle, those were better, but still, nothing special. We were underwhelmed.

The onion rings are good, but get ketchup. The ranch they serve them with is so super watery, it&#39;s not worth dipping. 

The taco pizza is spicy. It&#39;s good, not great, we wish we would have tried something different. Our son ordered a cheese kids&#39; pizza meal. He got fruit as his side, $1 extra for out of season watermelon, not worth the up charge. His pizza was very big, but not the ideal crust for a kid...too crispy! 

The service was awesome. The space is so comfortable, especially with a kid.

It&#39;s a good place to come and watch a game - there are TV&#39;s everywhere. The service can be hit or miss. I will say that they needed to turn up the heat this last time - it was freezing by the window!

You see lots of families here, kids being brought in after games and the typical folks who use it as the local pub.

I&#39;ve noticed a drop in quality over my last few visits.  I think it&#39;s probably been three or four months since we last went there.  With my daughter home from college for the weekend, we chose Jersey&#39;s so we could get a wide choice of foods, one of which would be a nice salad for her.  (She loves salads.)

The place was pretty full when we arrived at about 7PM on a Saturday evening.  After a very short wait, we were seated.  They gave us our menus, then began the 15 minute wait until they came to take our drink order.  After so long, we said we would place our dinner order at the same time.  I didn&#39;t check the time until the order came, but my guess was at least 1/2 hour to 45 minutes.  Two salads, a hamburger, a personal pizza and six hot wings took over 1/2 hour to serve.  

In fairness to our server, she was overwhelmed.  My guess is there are about 50 tables in the restaurant which has an interesting layout.  There is a large oval bar in the center of a large room which is surrounded by an oval of tables, then a higher level with an oval of tables.  There were three servers that I was able to see, and there was no plan to where they served.  Each server ran from one side of the restaurant to the other.  I felt very bad for them - people who were hungry were angry at them for poor planning.

Oh, the food.  Eh.  The salads looked good.  Perhaps I should have gotten a salad rather than a personal &#34;garbage&#34; pizza.  The pizza crust was okay - it was thin crust (not typical Chicago), and very crisp.  The sauce was blah.  The toppings were all undercooked.  It was disappointing.

So, I&#39;m scratching a regular restaurant off of my list and hoping to find a new &#34;regular american food&#34; restaurant nearby soon."

I don&#39;t know what it is about Sean but he always gets things right and was very good with making sure that he was attentive to our needs.

Or after Sunday service for lunch, if we have a taste for bar food and drinks.

They have tons of TVs and plenty of seats.  I like their huge leather u-shaped furniture facing the bar and jumbo TVs along both sides of the main bar.
They also have a private room for parties or it opens up if the main area is getting crowded.  

Food, I like is their fried chicken wings.  I like their daily food/drink specials, their thin chips with con queso cheese.  

Their thin crust pizzas are pretty good, but lately they have to ease up on the oregano.  The last 2 times we were here, the pizza was too herby.  Also their wild rice chicken soup was not as creamy as I was hoping for.  It was more soupy than creamy if you like that kind of soup.  The flavor was fine.

Eric, our server was very attentive and I like that he didn&#39;t come over to our table every 5 minutes especially when the Bears were playing.

They provided me with a certificate and this time I went and dined in. This was my experience.

My family came at about 4pm on a Saturday and I was surprised at the amount of families there were. Seems that 4pm is the prime time for adults with children to come to the restaurant. We were seated by the window with the beautiful view of the sunset and small water area. It was nice and the booth was roomy enough for our family of four and our car seat. 

We started off with the Parmesan Bites. These were alright, I would have probably picked something else if I knew they were going to be drenched in butter. Not so appetizing when there&#39;s a layer of butter on the bottom of your place along with parm cheese. Having butter is fine, but the amount of butter was not. 

My husband got the buffalo chicken with fries and my daughter got the kids cheeseburger. I got the full slab of ribs with 6 shrimp as the add on, along with a salad and their potato chips. 

Buffalo chicken - it was alright, had tons of sauce and fries were good. Nothing too special but not too bad either. 
Kid&#39;s cheeseburger - They&#39;re not playing when they say its the same as a regular burger but just a bit smaller. It was put on an adult bun but just a smaller patty. My daughter didn&#39;t eat much of it but I tasted it and it was pretty good. 
Full slab of ribs - Good flavor, but not tender and definitely not fall off the bone. I probably wouldn&#39;t order this again
Add on shrimp - Shrimp was actually probably the best thing I had at Jerseys but the only down fall was that we asked for cocktail sauce and they said they had none.. what were we supposed to dip our shrimp in? 
Side ceasar salad - drenched in salad dressing. ASK FOR IT ON THE SIDE. Lots of Parmesan on it, which was great. 

I definitely had a better experience and the food wasn&#39;t as bad as it was initially but I&#39;m still not sure I&#39;ll be back for the food. They do have some good daily specials for drinks so I may be back to watch a game and have a drink or two."

Fine but I had to wait another 30 minutes to get my food and the best they offered me were two free sodas.  No other discount on this order or gift card for next time.

When the waitress came over &amp; my friend told her about the chili to ask for a new bowl, she told him that the chili was made earlier &amp; had been sitting out all day so all the chili was cold not just his but she could microwave it.

The wings arrived &amp; were a lot better than the chili but still not as good as we remembered them to be.  The rest of the meal our conversation was about how come Jersey&#39;s isn&#39;t as good as before.

I did want to post my review today based on our last visit this past Friday, as it definitely left the most lasting impression. 

Wewalked in - the place was packed. None of us are sports fans, but it didn&#39;t take us long to realize that there must be a hockey game coming on.. lol Everyone was wearing a hawks jersey! We were seated quickly, and greeted very shortly after by our server, Michaela, who was attentive, friendly, sweet, FAST, and also knowledgeable about pretty much everything going on there! We were definitely impressed by the level of attention she provided each of her tables, as she was serving several tables in our section. Not one detail was missed at our table, and we never once had to ask for anything - she was on top of refills and anything else we might need, even making sure we had parmesan cheese on our table when the pizza came out. She also stopped by a few times to make sure everything was tasting perfect! Michaela definitely is the type of person to make sure that your experience is top notch, and I appreciate that! To do all of that, and leave such a great impression on us with a restaurant soooo jam packed is some serious talent. 

Towards the end of our meal, a man (I would assume a manager?) came over to ask us how our visit was, to which we replied &#34;Great!! Our waitress is amazing!&#34;. The man then told us that Michaela is up for a manager position. 

***Jersey&#39;s, I will tell you something - don&#39;t let this one get away!! Her friendly demeanor, great attention to detail, and her speed in getting drinks and food is just amazing. Your establishment would be lucky to have Michaela lead your team and mentor your staff!!!***

We ordered three salads, a chicken caesar wrap, and fish and chips. I had the Southwestern chicken salad with the dressing on the side. The salad was just so blah, I couldn&#39;t handle it. The dressing it came with was not too good, so I am glad I ordered a side of the avocado ranch as well. That dressing was a little better, but hardly any avocado taste, which was a letdown. It definitely needs some tortilla strips or something to give it texture. Definitely not delicious. Everyone else relayed their experiences to me about their food.
   My manager said her chicken wrap was incredibly soggy and there was way too much sauce on it. She asked for extra dressing on the side, but they decided to dump it on the wrap. It was inedible. My co-worker&#39;s fish and chips were incredibly greasy. Both had fries and they were disgustingly soggy and greasy. The other two salads had very dry ingredients, not fresh at all. The cucumbers looked like they had been cut a week ago and were just thrown into the salad at the last second.

Even now as I type out the review, I wish I lived closer as I would probably be online ordering right now, but I don&#39;t, so I will have to sigh and listen to my stomach grumble as I recall the memory of the nachos and pizza that we ordered. 

First off, I love the online ordering method. It is so easy, quick and to the point. I don&#39;t have to hear someone ramble on about specials, don&#39;t have to be put in hold and don&#39;t have to bother a busy server.

I really like the variety of food that they have. A lot of it is typical sports bar fare, and not the healthiest, but whatever....So many choices.

We ended up ordering the nachos which were quite filling and not bad reheated. Most nachos suck when reheated. These were ok.

BBQ Chicken pizza was ok. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of BBQ sauce on pizza, but it was alright. The crust was good and not all that deep dish dough fest crust.

I waivered back and forth between ordering the reuben, which I will have to try next time we are in town and nearby. And their menu references that they have a monstrosity of a corn beef sandwich that I will have to get acquainted with.

Lots of tempting choices and they had it hot and ready for pick up when they said it would be ready."

Salad was actually quite good- fresh greens, not iceberg, and good ingredients. I think it was supposed to be a Cobb salad.

Pizza.... Crust was leathery and tough. Cheese/sauce/toppings combined to be an utterly over salty pizza. I used to think pizza was still pretty good, even when it is bad.  But this proved otherwise.

Not sure about the decor, a bit sterile for my taste; a sports bar and grub through and through so what I&#39;m about to say next may surprise you. 

There were so many people with kids in tow that I was taken aback. The menu is diverse but it doesn&#39;t include a kids&#39; selection. What brings kids in to this establishment is currently an enigma. 

We ordered the jalapeno poppers (4 for $7.99). At first thought, it&#39;s a bit pricey. It&#39;s overstuffed with cream and cheddar cheeses with bacon to give it a nice kick. Worth the price to entice the taste buds into ordering more food and blowing off our plans to see a movie at the AMC across the street.

He ordered the Kobe burger with onion rings, I had the 6 piece Mango wings (the blue cheese dressing was so good) and the dude next to us gave us a BBQ  slider to try. I really wanted dessert but the Guiness took over!

The wings were so good, so long Buffalo Wild Wings, I think you&#39;ve been replaced (just kidding).  Nick the bartender, man of all trades... he does a real good job!"

I called 2 hours in advance to make a reservation and to make sure they were prepared for my challenge. We sat down and ordered. Everything was going fine. I signed my waiver and then was told they did not have the sauce..... We were all very dissapointed. Additionally we wanted to order milkshakes but they were out. A total let down!

Heres my findings.

The food continues to be great, we ordered fire starter, 2 spicy garlic, and a parm garlic along with onion rings.

The fire starter is good, the 2 spicy garlics both did not have any garlic taste to it, just the buffalo type sauce so we sent it back.  Then we switched them to 2 garlic parm, the garlic parm is great, light garlic taste with thick parm which makes sense since it&#39;s called parmesan garlic. 

The onion rings have a very nice flaky batter to it and come with an avocado ranch dip, it is slightly different than regular ranch.  THe batter is nice and I love that the onions inside are a nice solid onion so you get a nice snap when you bite into it.

I am a bit disappointed in the Monday night football.  It continues to disappoint but not as bad as the last review I put in. We had to ask for them to switch the sound over about 30 mins before the game.  The waitress seemed shocked it wasn&#39;t already switched but it took another 15 mins to get it switched and it just wasn&#39;t loud enough since there was 2 big tables seated near us that were very loud.  We probably should have asked to be moved since half the place was empty.

The other sad thing is they didn&#39;t even push the squares, I got there at 7 and the place was half full and no one was on the board.  I asked the waitress and she said just walk up to it and write your name in.  I did and it started a bunch of ppl walking over, but weird they don&#39;t announce it or encourage people to go over.  They could have filled most of the board If everyone went.  

Also they didn&#39;t actually put up numbers until 4 mins into the 2nd quarter.  This might not seem bad but 4 mins in was actually after the 2nd power outage at San Fran, where the game was being played, and it was about a 15 mins delay, meaning no numbers until about 30 mins after the 2nd quarter started.

The food is the only reason to come, the Monday Night Football event is nothing special since they don&#39;t seem to be eager to get it right time after time.  And sadly we had a 4th person show up about 2 hours after we got there and they gave him his food but no utensils to eat it with, had to chase down another waitress to get that too.

Bottom line: go for the food, not the monday night football.  Service is acceptable but not great."

For the sports fans: you&#39;ve got many tv&#39;s to watch whatever sporting event(s) is on. The beer is great! Pizza and other bar food items are really good. Hot wings are better than Buffalo Wild Wings (in my opinion). 

Cons: service is POOR! 
I cannot tell you how many times I have given this place a chance because I really enjoy their food but the service just sucks. 
There have been many nights (like a few nights ago) when we&#39;ve ordered pizza and wings. We ask for wings to be extra wet or even extra sauce on the side. Nope...bone dry and no sauce to be found anywhere. I&#39;ve called there and complained and they actually get mad when they have to send their driver back out. Well...if you would have gotten the order right the first time we wouldn&#39;t be in this position now. 

A few nights ago we ordered a sausage pizza. 50 minutes later we get a cold cheese pizza. What the!!!!! We called to complain and the offered us a $15 credit. No thanks. I wanted a sausage pizza. 

Little things like that make me wonder why I continue to order from this place. Our experience is just slightly better when we dine in.   

Overall, if you have an opportunity to try this place, go for it. Don&#39;t expect to be impressed with the service. It&#39;s hit or miss here. Mostly, a lot of misses."

- The Western Pizza (9.5/10)
- Italian Beef Pizza (3/10)
- Jalapeno Poppers (10/10)
- Phantom Challenge Wings (OMG)

Kinda surprised I haven&#39;t reviewed this place. I only go here like every other week! If you&#39;re familiar with any of my other reviews, this is part of the Bermuda Triangle (Wallet gets skinnier, I get fatter...mysteriously) of the Schaumburg Area. 

It&#39;s a very spacious area inside with plenty of tables and a central bar with giant screens hanging above them surrounded by 4-6 TVs on each side. There&#39;re also TVs scattered around the bar showing something sports related. It&#39;s probably a great place to watch sports, but it&#39;s a little too open and just on that side of restaurant-y that it doesn&#39;t make for a good sports bar scene (unlike Americas Bar, Wild Bull, Fox &amp; Hound, etc). They have the semicircle booths all around the wall, which are nice &#39;n&#39; comfy, but don&#39;t sit in the middle of them, because you&#39;re sitting on a plank of wood. And on to the food...

THE WESTERN PIZZA
This is actually a very unique pizza. The concept has been around for a little while, but it&#39;s strange that of all the places I&#39;ve seen do a BBQ Sauce based pizza, nobody does it quite like this. Most places that have a BBQ Sauce pizza have chicken pieces on them, and you know....it kinda ok, but it&#39;s like everyone started out with a really good thing and sorta spoiled it with chicken. The Western Pizza is BBQ Sauce, cheese, sausage, ham, bacon, and red onions. O M G !! All on a semi-thin crispy crunchy crust. It&#39;s amazing! The BBQ Sauce is just a perfect balance of sweet and tangy to work for a pizza and its ingredients. The sausage is flavorful and the bacon and ham give it a nice smoky lining, and the red onions just seal the deal to get that last bit of flavor to linger just a little longer. Beautiful! 

So where did that 0.5 point fall from? Consistency. 9 out of 10 times I go, the pizza is excellent, but there are those times where they did something wrong. Sometimes, they cook a little too long, which makes the crust the perfect texture, but it sorta chokes the flavor out of the sauce and onions, so you&#39;re only relying on bacon, ham, and sausage to deliver, but they&#39;re just too overworked to even have a chance of salvaging it. It really does taste like particle board, with sudden bits of sausagy, hammy, bacony goodness. So, as long as you get to skip that experience, you&#39;ve got the best BBQ pizza on the planet!

ITALIAN BEEF PIZZA
...then we go to the other side of the spectrum. This pizza just straight up sucks. You know, I wasn&#39;t even really all that thrilled about the idea of it, but figured we&#39;d try something new for a change. I&#39;m pretty sure there was no pizza sauce, but I&#39;m not 100%. It was on the same thin crispy crunchy crust, but a lot of mozzarella and chunks of Italian Beef with giardinera sprinkled on it. Pizza is absolutely flavorless. The beef is flavorless. The only signs of life here are the giardinera mix only because giardinera celery pieces are pickled. Don&#39;t waste your time or money on this one! 

JALAPENO POPPERS
Hands down, best poppers I&#39;ve ever had. What do you think of when you think of poppers? You think of small coins of jalapenos breaded and fried with some cheapo cheese right? These are definitely not your normal poppers. In fact, you&#39;d be crazy to try to &#34;pop&#34; these. These are somewhere between jalapeno poppers and chile relleno! These are pretty decent size FULL jalapeno peppers, 3-4 inches long, about 2 inches in diameter. Perfect texture, filled with a cheese blend I can&#39;t even explain, and also with bacon, and a nice breading to go over it. Not the standard issue popper breading, but a more substantial breading. And to top it all off, a great dipping sauce to go with it (which I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out what it is). If you&#39;re lucky enough to get a spicy jalapeno, man, these are to die for! Best poppers EVAR!

PHANTOM CHALLENGE!
Don&#39;t. Just Don&#39;t. You have to finish 12 Hooters sized wings doused in a Ghost Chili sauce. Prior to the recent genetic manipulations, this was the hottest pepper on the face of the planet at 1 million Scovilles (jalapenos have 3000)! The sauce has the consistency of guacamole and the wings are completely covered in it! They come out piping hot (temperature hot) so it&#39;s hard to even hold &#39;em, and you have 15 minutes to eat all 12. No drinks, no utensils, no napkins, no rubbing sauce off, no nothing! If you win, you get a shirt, a $10 coupon to Jerseys, and your face on their website. 

Yes I accomplished this (on my lunch break actually), and I have never had a burning feeling quite like the one I had all night in my entire life! I saw Man vs Food do it, so I wanted to try it. I tried it, I accomplished it, but man am I NEVER doing that again! Oh, yeah, it costs $12 too! 

BOTTOM LINE
I love this place. Like I said, I go here once every other week for lunch. Western+Popppers. It&#39;s not only good, but keeps you coming back consistently!"

Service - I hate knocking service but it was really bad on my last visit. It took forever for a drink order, tables seated after us were served before us, beer glass sitting empty for extended periods of time before offered another one, etc. A lot of people were working, but didn&#39;t seem to be efficient at all. 

Pizza - really good thin crust. I liked it. 

Wings - Tried some different sauces and they were pretty flavorless. They had a Siracha flavor sauce and it was bland and really not spicy which you&#39;d expect from Siracha wings. I actually think that while I ordered two different sauces I may have received only 1, I couldn&#39;t tell the difference. 

Atmosphere - Hard to beat with all of the games, TV&#39;s, etc. This is a great place to watch a game. However, I will say that I was here on a night with games on and it wasn&#39;t that busy, not busy like I remembered it used to be. They used to pack this place in and it was fun, bands, etc. 

It&#39;s a great venue but in my last visit seemed to have declined from a service and food quality perspective."

We have a fun Beer O Clock on Fridays at 4pm, so everyone can open a cold one and relax a bit as the weekend quickly approaches. In December, we decided to add wings &amp; appetizers to our sacred Beer O&#39;Clock. I was fully onboard with the idea and started researching places that delivered wings. I&#39;m Yelp obsessed so, of course, it was my first resource. I liked the reviews and thought they had some interesting flavors on their menu for the wings.

We have now had the Friday delivery just three times with the latest being yesterday. Those pesky holidays in December kept getting in the way of our beer &amp; wings day! :P 

Everytime we have ordered there is slight confusion from the initial person on the phone but once we talk to either the female GM or the Owner, they are just excellent! They really know their stuff and customer service is obviously very important to them.

Now, we have tried a couple different flavors of the wings and so far I&#39;ve liked them all. Honey BBQ were excellent albeit a bit spicy (I&#39;m super weak on the spicy front). Yesterday, we tried the Coca-Cola wings, which I really liked. I can&#39;t handle spicy as I said so I really liked the sweetness of them. However the general consensus from my coworkers was, Sarah, don&#39;t ever order these again!  Also we tried the boneless original wings...it was our first time trying the boneless as delivery and we really liked them. They were medium in spiciness which really pushed my poor little taste buds to their absolute maximum!!! The rookie was also good but too spicy for me!

Aside from the wings I&#39;ve tried the parmesan balls which are breaded balls with parmesan on the outside and the fried mushrooms. I really like they mushrooms and they aren&#39;t overly deep fried. Just enough to be yummy! :) The balls, however, I am not a fan of. 

They have some flavors of wings I&#39;m really looking forward to trying in the future! The maple, the spicy teriyaki, mango and garlic parmesan...I see them all in my future!"

I have chosen to go elsewhere in the past because of the fear of getting one of their crappy waiters. (once, one guy was SO bad that we complained to the manager, and as it turns out, he was one of the head waiters--for shame, dude--you sucked!)

But last night, we went there, and I can&#39;t remember her name, but she was SUCH a sweet waitress.  My son, of course, flirted with her, and she ate it up.  She was as really good waitress, too.  She was very attentive without being overpowering, and we got everything in a good amount of time.  The banana pepper pizza was good (and only $6 on Wednesdays!).  My daughter&#39;s &#34;kids&#34; cheese pizza was the same size as the $6 one, and it was delicious--she loved it!  The chicken soup was good as was my mandarin orange salad!

We have been dying to come here since we have heard really good things, plus who doesn&#39;t enjoy a great pizza?

We started off with their boneless buffalo wings in the Sweet Chili sauce.  WOW--awesome flavor and great texture.  We would&#39;ve liked more heat, but it was still really good.  Then, we had a chef special for pizza.  We wanted to go outside of the zone and try something different.  We got the Taco Pizza which packed a ton of flavor and its even good cold.  I really enjoyed the crunch of the tortilla chips along with the heat of the peppers.  The medium pizza was enough for us and we still had leftovers.

Our waiter was also really accomodating... the place was dead, but he wasn&#39;t overbearing and at our table every second, but he was there the perfect amount.  Refilling my bf&#39;s diet coke 4 times (the boy can drink pop like nobody&#39;s business), getting us extra side items, involving us with the multiple choice game, etc.  The place is also really laid out well--its like a huge circle with TVs in the middle so everyone has a good view of the game.

Service: When the bar was empty the service was ok. Once there was a crowd (and not a large one) the service was non existent. Saw my waitress exactly twice from the end of half time forward, once was to get the check, the second was to give me back my bill. The bartenders/waitresses/managers were too busy chatting among themselves to be bothered. They were hanging at a table by the entrance...away from the patrons.  

Food: If I was from Restaurant Impossible I would of had a field day. The appetizer was something a 4 year old concocted (potato chips with chipolte sauce and ranch?). Guess we should have picked something else. The pizza was made from frozen dough or totally frozen. Not what I expected from a place that looks up scale and as nice as it does.   

Other: The satellite dish went out about 10 times. Not a SINGLE time did anyone from the bar apologize or give us an update as to the status. Horrible!!!!

My friends and I come for  the good food- the huge meaty wings and the Western pizza are great, but it is so frustrating to deal with the terribly slow and MINDLESS SERVICE. 

The first time we had bad service the place was empty (we came mid afternoon so before dinner rush). The waitress brought us our wings... No plates. No napkins. Then she brought the pizza. Didn&#39;t clear out the old wing plate, just pushed it to the side and plopped our pizza down. Again, still no plates. Still no napkins. No peppers, no cheese. And she didn&#39;t even come by for us to be able to request these items, so I walked two tables over and grabbed cheese and peppers from another table. I can understand the bar drinks taking a while, that&#39;s not the server&#39;s fault. But, for a glass of water... I shouldn&#39;t be down to eating the last ice cube in the cup before I get a refill. 

The second time i had bad service, it was so terrible I had to flag down the manager to ask whether the server even put our order in. We got there at 6:30 pm, so I wanted to give the server some slack because it was during dinner rush... but our experience was unexcusable. Ordered waters, appetizer, wings and the pizza that came with the groupon right off the bat. Our nachos and wings came about 20 min later... No water in sight at this point. We also would have liked to talk to our server instead of the food runner to order our beers. Once we finally ordered beer, our beers came ONE AT A TIME. At 7:40 our waiter asks if we wanted to order the pizza that had come with the groupon... THE ONE THAT I ORDERED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAMN MEAL. I was like... So, you didn&#39;t put the pizza in yet? He said something along the lines of yes he did, he just confused us with the table over. Promised it would be out in 5-10 minutes for our pizza. I also asked for that water refill i had requested earlier. 20 minutes later, still no pizza (and still no refill).  Had to ask the manager what was going on. She said she knows the pizza is in the oven. But if we ordered at like 6:40 why is the pizza still in the oven over an hour later. I mean, this is thin crust pizza we&#39;re talking about, not some kind of fancy Chicago deep dish. The manager graciously gave us certificates for our next visit, but I&#39;m not sure if even that can convince me to come back and give this place another chance.  Two hours after we sat down (it is now 8:30 pm) we end up having to take the stupid pizza to go.  

Also... I&#39;m not sure how comfortable I feel with the waiter walking off with my phone for the Groupon. Before I became a nurse, I worked at a Buffalo Wild Wings for a few years and I was trained that I should never walk off with my customer&#39;s cell phone. The manager would come to the table personally to redeem their mobile coupon so the customer never has to worry about where their phone is going. Any thoughts on the server walking off with your cellphone? Please share."

Because it was shortly after they&#39;d opened, it was nice and quiet (TVs were not too loud).  I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and ordered fries instead of the chips that come with it.  When the waitress, Steph, brought my sandwich, she&#39;d forgotten to substitute the fries.  I pointed that out and she immediately apologized and got me the fries in about three minutes.  Also, she didn&#39;t charge me for them.  THAT is excellent customer service.  The sandwich, itself, was quite good.  The chicken breast was a nice thick cut and the buffalo sauce had just a little kick (I like it very spicy but this wasn&#39;t).  The fries were hot and nicely seasoned.

I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap which was a little short. I realized it was because I didn&#39;t get the blue cheese which they had as an extra option. I think it would have been smoother and tastier. MY friend got a pulled pork sandwich with onion rings. The onion rings seemed like they were housemade, the batter was thick, the onion was crisp and overall I thought it was a good tasty choice. The chips that are the default option are still good-obviously made in house as well. Crispy, slightly seasoned yum.

My buddy&#39;s gf got a salad which to be honest was a little plain-but it was a salad but it was mostly lettuce with a little bit of everything else.  A pretty good choice for a pre-movie dinner."

If not for Yelp&#39;s Monday Night Blitz last year, I would have never known about this place since it&#39;s tucked away from Barrington Road North of the AMC theaters off I90.

For some reason the manager/ bartender was taking care of everyone on a slow night- the Opening Ceremonies for the 2012 XXX Olympics.  This didn&#39;t affect service at all though.  Well, it was slow because it was kind of late, past the dinner rush for sure.

The prices are a little steep but the variety of food and drink specials bring that see-saw back to level.  On this visit, a multitude of fried treats and a small pizza was consumed.  There&#39;s a combo buffalo wangs (that&#39;s how I&#39;m going to spell wings, deal with it), boneless buffalo wangs, and buffalo shrimp all together that you can choose different sauces for.  Cooked right, seasoned well, and let me reassure you that their &#34;Hot, Hot, Hot&#34; sauce/coating is not falsely advertised and they even gave me the heat-hiccups (you know what those are if you&#39;re a true fan of spicy).  There&#39;s two hotter than that, one of which is the Phantom Challenge- send me a message if you tried that one, I want to know about it!

Pulled pork pizza was also worth the half-hour trip it took me all by itself.  To be completely honest, the 15% food discount for a check-in on Yelp was the deal breaker.

Oh, almost forgot, if you like bleu cheese, Jersey&#39;s is nipple-erecting.  Flavorful, chunky, cheesy, mmmmmmmmmmmh."

They usually don&#39;t have a problem accomodating 8-10 of us and are really quick with service.  If there is a game on, one of their many TVs will have it.  The place is kept very clean and is definitely a good place for larger groups.

They almost always have a good drink special and I never have a problem finding a draft beer I like (aside from the standard Miller/Bud/Coors products).  The food is pretty darn good too.  I&#39;ve had the pizza (B+), original buffalo wings (B+), chicken tenders (A), and my friends love the California Burger.  They have homemade chips along with fries as a side, but skip the fries.  The chips are crispy and fresh and dusted with a salty seasoning that is really good (but can be a bit too salty).

My one question: Why can&#39;t we have a pitcher of water?!?!  After an hour on a dusty softball field, we are all pretty parched.  For some reason, the waitress said that management doesn&#39;t like to give you a pitcher of water, but only glasses instead.  What gives?"

But fortunately this lunch was different from ones I rememeber in the past. 

For this lunch I took a chance and ordered their pulled pork sandwich.  It&#39;s always a risk ordering it anywhere because many chefs have no problem leaving gobs of pork fat mixed in with the meat.  Fortunately, this place didn&#39;t do that so I enjoyed the sandwich a lot.  Then what made the lunch even better was the dessert.  I tried the chocolate chip brownie with ice cream and the server, Brianna, made sure it came with freshly made coffee.  Honestly, either the sandwich OR the dessert would have made my meal wonderful, but together they made it a very memorable lunch."

Maybe that&#39;s why I stay away from franchises. I like uniqueness. This is a franchise... they pump potpourri into the air on a timer, it smells like Bed Bath and Beyond...there&#39;s industrial blue cleaner in the toilets like a port-o-let waiting for the concert rush.

Let me start by saying the server was friendly and helpful, and my beer was cold.  But, it was all downhill from there. 

This was our second visit to this location, and our initial experience wasn&#39;t bad.  That&#39;s why my wife and I purchased a Groupon for $20 in &#34;Appetizers&#34; and decided to go back again.  

After looking at the menu we had decided to order Nachos and chicken wings.  The server apologetically told us that chicken wings were not on the &#34;Appetizer&#34; menu would not count as an &#34;Appetizer&#34; for the Groupon.  After a short conversation with the manager, he RELUCTANTLY gave in and told us that he would let us order chicken wings as an &#34;appetizer&#34;.  I got the impression however that the manager thought he might loose his job over satisfying a customer, over an order of Chicken Wings!

First of all, whose ever heard of chicken wings not being considered an &#34;appetizer&#34;?

On every menu at every restaurant or bar that I&#39;ve ever been to, chicken wings are a staple on that left side of the page, otherwise called &#34;Appetizers or Starters&#34;. I guess that it&#39;s now up for debate thanks to the Tilted Kilt!

As it turned out, what a waste of time and energy,  The Chicken Wings were a complete let down! They were served luke warm and they had a funky taste to them like they were leftover&#39;s or something.  

The Nachos were disappointing too.  We paid an additional charge to add both ground beef and chicken which were SCARCELY spread across the top of some melted cheddar cheese.  Underneath the top layer was a layer of some unidentifiable cheese-whiz-like substance. Why not use REAL cheese throughout an entire plate of Nachos?

I have some advise for ownership and management:

1.) Empower your staff to satisfy your customer&#39;s requests. To substitute one item for another shouldn&#39;t require a call to the Tiled Kilt Corporate Office!  Let your servers make that call.
2.) Improve the quality of your product and don&#39;t be so stingy with the ingredients.
3.) Next time you offer a Groupon, don&#39;t limit what customers can choose on your menu.
4.) Put Chicken Wings back in their proper place on your menu, with the &#34;Appetizers&#34;!"

The manager&#39;s eagerness to correct the issue was unexpected and a wonderful experience. I am very happy that the management and staff were concerned that an allergy slipped through their operating procedure. They reassured me that this is a rare occurrence. Normally at the restaurant, a server walks the food directly to the table to ensure that the order is correct for the customer especially when an allergy is concerned. 

I ordered from GrubHub. When ordering through GrubHub, a 3rd party places and picks up the order to deliver to the customer. In this process, communication can be lost. Next time ordering from GrubHub, I will call the restaurant myself to advise them of my food allergy. 

I am very pleased with how the situation was handled. I really appreciate the manager, Vinny, and all he did to reassure me of their procedures. Thanks!!!!"

Then someone else came (waitstaff) and the two of them go into it for another 5 minutes (again, a very long time when you are just standing  there waiting for a table - of which there were plenty) - we decided we weren&#39;t willing to spend 10 minutes being ignored, so we just left."

That said, there aren&#39;t many places like this in the area where I go out -- and I like this place. I like it so much that I&#39;m probably going to go at least once a month. It&#39;s basically a classier Hooters but with &#34;Scottish&#34; (aka school girl) outfits and bartenders that wear kilts. 

The layout is great and the TVs are everywhere. The only food that I&#39;ve had there has been the potato skins and they were just fine. Nothing to brag about. 

The service when we went the first time was good. The second time was just ok. There was a calendar with specials on it and it said that the night we were there was Ladies&#39; Night and Menu Food was 1/2 off.  Long story short, that only applied to Entrees, and we ordered appetizers. So I&#39;d recommend checking the specials with your server girl before you order if you are there for them. :)"

First of all, they greet us very well and quick. Second of all, when we came in the champions league final was about to start 
Finally, the California burger was amazing and well packed with its traditional veggies and a hefty portion of guacamole, and for the side sweet potato fries. 

So today&#39;s experience was like no other for me I mean great service with beautiful women, watching the best sport in the world(soccer), a burger with amazing toppings, and last but not list sweet sweet potato fries!

The food I&#39;ve had there is not bad for bar food, including the wings, chili and burgers. I also like the beer selection, which includes, for instance, Magic Hat #9. I&#39;m not sure if they always have it in the rotation, but the fact that they had it at least once is a good sign. Also they&#39;re loaded with TV&#39;s.

One word of caution. If you go to Tilted Kilt with your significant other, be prepared to either block out the incessant cleavage or expect a lot of annoyed looks from your loved one. I think they waitresses actually out-cleavage Hooters."

This place is the restaurant version of A Knight&#39;s Tale -- you know, the Heath Ledger fluffball with pretty people singing &#34;We Will Rock You&#34; in allegedly medieval times. I mean, they don&#39;t seem to know the difference between Scottish, Irish, English and sports bar and... they don&#39;t really seem to care. And you don&#39;t care either, because you&#39;re too busy looking at -- or trying not to look at -- the copious cleavage.

OK. So it&#39;s yet another sports bar. With this bizarro theme and some terrible puns on the menu. (Chilelagh cheeseburger? REALLY??) They have burgers, wings, wraps, a few &#34;Irish&#34; favorites, chicken, pizza, etc. And, they have scantily clad waitresses. Most of whom are quite attractive. (What? I&#39;m not blind, okay?)

Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and ... dare I say it... perky? And the food was pretty good, actually. I was a little bit bad -- it was not a great day -- and went with the &#34;Scottish&#34; cheesesteak (neither Scottish nor a proper cheesesteak, but whatever) and while it didn&#39;t quite make it to Philly standards, the beef was tender, properly shredded and tasty. I upgraded to garlic fries, which were buttery-garlicky sticks of potatoey goodness.

This probably won&#39;t be a regular stop for us, but it&#39;s a tasty option when we&#39;re out that way on Lake St, and it&#39;s always good to have more options."
tilted-kilt-pub-and-eatery-roselle-2,Robert G.,5Lwp4dv_yxLYoh9zihelWA,"Carol Stream, IL",1,1,1,150,86,hBdknuOp33kfe73XA1COqA,4.0,2010-12-29,"I wasn&#39;t entirely sure what to expect here, besides the attractive servers and food of questionable quality. I&#39;m happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised by my meal here. I wouldn&#39;t at all mind coming back. The strangest thing about the experience is that, with the theme being a Scottish bar, there wasn&#39;t a single redheaded waitress on staff (that I noticed). Weird.

As far as food goes... I had the French Connection burger, which is their mushroom, swiss and onion. The quality of the ingredients of the burger was all right; the mushrooms were fresh and the patty was freshly made (and cooked medium, just as I asked). The bun was, well, weak. Even though it&#39;s a single patty burger, I expect a heartier bun. Don&#39;t come here wanting a gourmet burger, even if it&#39;s sold like one; it&#39;s solid, but it ain&#39;t that good.

Fortunately, the burger comes with flavorful au jus on the side, to &#34;glue&#34; the whole thing together. Use the jus. Use it prodigiously. It makes everything better.

Sweet potato fries were a welcome option, and here they&#39;re rippled and dressed with parsley. Although they needed a little salt, they otherwise had great flavor and texture and went really well with the burger.

While I was here, I also had bites of their spicy wings (which were largely forgettable) and their &#34;signature wings&#34;, which were not. The signature wings were very tender and juicy. Some sort of sweet and sour sauce covered the outside of the wings. Overall they were very good; much better than Hooters.

The waitresses were, as you might expect, attractive, but as you might not expect, surprisingly diverse. As an Asian, I was happy to see that. :-D Let&#39;s also say that Tilted Kilt could singlehandedly prop up the Wonderbra, and any of that product&#39;s cousins.

Overall I&#39;d be happy to come back here and try some other items on the menu."
tilted-kilt-pub-and-eatery-roselle-2,Dave S.,viNNiVtWSSBCbNPwuNV65A,"Lombard, IL",0,1,0,30,396,9j0e2c0lqtsEU_Au17H12g,1.0,2012-07-03,"To me, Tilted Kilt is a symbol of what&#39;s wrong with our country. There are plenty of symbols of what&#39;s right, but Tilted Kilt ain&#39;t one of them. 

A little primer on &#34;breastaurants,&#34; such TK and Hooters: the scantily-clad girls aren&#39;t officially &#34;servers.&#34; They&#39;re hired as &#34;entertainers.&#34; Can you guess why? If not, ask yourself why places like this never have unfit/unattractive girls serving you food, and how they can exclude the not-so-hotties but never get sued for discrimination. 

Restaurants have servers; breastaurants have entertainers. Do they entertain? Well, if showing lots of skin is entertaining, then yes. But that&#39;s the only form of entertainment they offer, because the service is lousy and uncoordinated, and that&#39;s just at the bar. Upon arriving, one &#34;kiltie&#34; asked me if I wanted a drink while another kiltie was two feet behind her, pouring my beer. Yet when I wanted an order of fries a while later, no one could be found for at least five minutes. The small flock of kilties at the front door saw me looking for service but didn&#39;t do much to help. Guess that&#39;s not how they entertain.

I&#39;m a little embarrassed in admitting that I&#39;ve been here three times: once with a family group and twice with a bandmate on the way home from practice. Only this last time did I get something good to eat: the fries. A basket of fries is three bucks and quite good. Their beer selection is decent but not great. The wings aren&#39;t worth the price, and I suspect the rest of the menu is a bad deal.

If you&#39;re a married guy like me, you&#39;ll have several conflicting thoughts running through your head at TK:

1. &#34;How much sluttier can a girl get with that get-up?&#34;
2. &#34;Is the rumor true that girls have their breast implants paid for by this place?&#34;
3. &#34;If I go with a significant other, where may I direct my eyes?&#34;
4. &#34;Why aren&#39;t the girls as hot as the ones on the commercial?&#34;
5. &#34;Exactly how young are they? Am I in danger of committing pedophilia with my eyes?&#34;

I believe I have some answers:

1. Not much sluttier. Something about this outfit makes Hooters outfits look girl-next-door wholesome. It&#39;s like two CEOs went into a Halloween shop, found the &#34;sexy Scots-woman&#34; costume, paid a genius in product design to make it ten times more entrancing, and voila! (Although one male worker at TK also had to wear a kilt. Poor guy.)

2. I asked a kiltie once about the rumor, and she said that it was not true. Tilted Kilt does not pay entertainers to get any enhancements done. Perhaps kilties buy Wonder-Bras in bulk.

3. It&#39;s impossible not to look you-know-where. I&#39;m an ecstatically-happily-married leg man, and I couldn&#39;t look away. If the kilties wore a little sign in their cleavage that said &#34;try the honey weiss,&#34; sales of honey weiss would triple. Perhaps this is why TK has so many TVs. I know many wives are forgiving of their spouse&#39;s wandering eyes. Still, it&#39;s hard to sit here and not become a cad. 

4. Here&#39;s where I&#39;m particularly conflicted. One of TK&#39;s many TVs seems to run an awful lot of Tilted Kilt ads. The women in one particular commercial - and I&#39;m using the term &#34;women&#34; here, for a reason I&#39;ll explain in a bit - are stunning, not only in their looks but in their manners. Their walk, their stare, their &#34;I know what you want&#34; facial setting. But TV adds an awful lot of glamour. Here, at this real-world place, I get no smoky stare. The attire says &#34;look at me&#34; but little eye contact is made. Perhaps they should wear what runway models wear, since models pout and stare off in the distance. Or maybe they could dress like that detached Svedka android from 2033 while pouring me a vodkatini.

5. Last time, I asked the poor kilted man about the girls&#39; ages. He told me that not all employees there were 18 or over. So think about that, fellow men. You may be staring at the chest of a girl that isn&#39;t even legal. How far do you want to carry the fantasy? Perhaps I misunderstood him, perhaps not. Either way, I feel &#34;wronger&#34; than ever setting foot in TK, and I doubt I&#39;ll come back.

When I watch TV on sports and see an attractive woman offering little insight from the sidelines, I ask myself why they combine things to diminished effect. Why not have a good-but-not-hot announcer feed me pertinent info while showing the cheerleaders on the sidelines? I feel that way about Tilted Kilt. It&#39;s better for me to visit a place with good food and a good price, then go home and watch women&#39;s volleyball. 

Tilted Kilt is not the only bad &#34;breastaurant&#34; in America - Show-Me&#39;s, anyone? - but it&#39;s still a symbol of corporate style over actual substance. It tries to satisfy the stomach and the libido at the same time, with mediocre results. If men decided against one-stop-shopping for their bodily urges, TK would run out of business. They&#39;ll keep getting customers, but I won&#39;t be one of them."

Tilted Kilt in an unlikely midtown location, enjoy the entrance (door always locked) with a doorbell, and your very quiet greeting by a well-dressed someone of whom you must convince to let you in via a reservation (Sun-Mon-Tues only) or by agreeing to wait on a list.  Sit in, stand by the bar, or grab a seat. Sip your cocktails while enjoying some civilized, relaxing conversation. This is a great place to catch the sporting events. 

Tilted Kilt Pub &amp; Eatery tops my list of city speakeasy&#39;s for the beverage selection and atmosphere.  A bit pricey (aren&#39;t they all?), but if you nurse your drink correctly, you can easily have two over the span of an hour and walk out without much of a dent in your wallet."

If your daughter applies for a job at this restaurant she may become a stripper in the future...oh i&#39;m sorry a dancer...just a warning

with that being said My wife and myself went into the Tilted Kilt yesterday for lunch. Having never heard or read anything about this eatery it was a total blind decision to dine here. Upon walking in the first vibe you get is that of a local sports pub slash brewery. Then it&#39;s boobs, boobs and mini skirts. Now don&#39;t get me wrong I like boobs and mini skirts, just no when i&#39;m eating.  It&#39;s creepy to walk around the dining floor seeing all the single gentlemen having lunch  by themselves and a young dancer....I mean server sitting with them, flirting for tips. Again this is a restaurant not a under age adult gentleman&#39;s club. 

After reviewing the menu you may notice that ninety percent of the fair is carb heavy bar crap. Stuff that you need no less then a pitcher of beer to remotely consider ordering. However if you frequent this establishment more than once by accident (like myself) then you are here for something other than the food....yes sir you might be a pervert. 

In closing, the food is ok...bar food. After we finished and received a take home box. I wrote out the credit card slip. I sat and pondered for a moment. Where do I leave the tip?? on the table or do I tuck it???"

Unfortunately this one doesn&#39;t hack it. Our experience started out good as we were promptly greeted and seated.

Our server came up and introduced herself and we ordered a round of beers. The server brought us our drinks and seated herself to exchange some witty banter. Now mind you, I understand this is part of their gimmick. But to sound scripted and uninterested is not what I think the owners had in mind. After all, you did sit down at our table...

So we try ordering an appetizer and our entrees. I ask for the Cheese-steak sandwhich with a side of Au Jus. She responds with &#34;How about a French Dip and I&#39;ll ask the chefs to change the cheese from Swiss to Provelone and add Peppers because it&#39;s cheaper and I don&#39;t know how to add a side of Au Jus because know one&#39;s asked for that before...&#34; Wow... Ok.

So after we give our order she sticks around until the hostess comes up to her and says another table was seated in her section... 2 dudes with tattoos. Our server then promptly leaves to enter our orders and go sit with the tattooed gentlemen. 

In the mean time, our food shows up. Before the appetizer. Our server - still sitting with the tattooed gentlemen. The food runner literally threw the food down and was gone before we even knew the appetizer wasn&#39;t coming. The manger? Playing on his cell phone on the floor. Awesome. Oh and we were out of beer....

Finally the server came up to us and asked if we wanted another round. I pointed out that we never received the appetizer and to please ensure we don&#39;t get billed for it. She apologetically explained that she was distracted from our conversation and completely forgot we ordered it. Cool...

After that, she paniced and just gave us the bill so we could pay. She never really walked away when my friend put down the Debit Card and we were figuring what we should do for tip. 

Overall, I understand that it&#39;s a gimmick bar and grill to get guys to fork out tons of money on beer and food because the servers are wearing enticing uniforms. But service is still a mainstay. Customer&#39;s experience is the most important thing. Because of this experience, we are going to continue to the next TK in the area to see how they stack up."

I work a couple blocks away from this location so it&#39;s convenient for me after being super hungry from missing lunch... add to that, I don&#39;t know the area well, at all. So, knowing TK from it&#39;s downtown location, I thought I&#39;d give it a try. I figured the worst case scenario would be I&#39;d be served an average meal by a pretty face in a short skirt. Let&#39;s call a spade a spade.

I was actually pleasantly surprised that the girls (and the one guy) were all really engaging in a (seemingly) genuine way. Sure, they are doing it for tips and it&#39;ll work more often than not. BUT, it doesn&#39;t come off as forced. I was sitting at the bar and a couple of the girls came over and talked to me even though neither one was serving me. I had asked the bartender if she kept her tips or if there was tip-sharing. She had told me each server keeps their tips. So, maybe the group effort was coordinated or maybe it wasn&#39;t, but it was pleasant at any rate.

So, this place has good burgers and excellent garlic fries. It also had every game, fight, sport related thing on many tvs. The beer selection good be a little broader, but they have a couple I like. Take all this, which would make for a good sports bar on its own merits, and add to it the fact that a young, cute girl in a short skirt is doing the serving and chatting you up... well, like I said before. Let&#39;s call a spade a spade... and this is a trump card!

Haha, but seriously, it&#39;s a good place for lunch or drinks after work with some friends. Plus, it&#39;s not too over the top or too much, so if your group includes females, they&#39;ll probably be ok watching the game there, too."

(Hooters Jr., anyone?)
This place reminds me of a really nice college pub.  If I were still in college, and there was nothing better around, this would be a decent joint.  BUT, since I am not stuck in a dirty college town anymore and there ARE way nicer places to eat quality food, drink craft beer, and watch sports, this place just falls short.
I will say, however, that the place is HUGE.  There are a lot of televisions, a big bar, and lots of seating.  There were a couple of larger parties around us so they can accommodate for that which is nice.  
The food is decent.  It&#39;s not horrible, but it isn&#39;t anything to write home about.  I got the fish and chips and my man got a burger and mozzarella sticks.  The food came out quickly and the waitress was pretty good but the food was just meh.  Like I said before, I could get better in other places.  If you are a fish and chips fan, the meal here is a good portion and the fish is good quality but the breading is a little crispy for my taste.  Also, the tartar sauce was decent but a little heavy on the relish.  What am I?  Some kind of fish and chips connoisseur?  Yes.  Yes, I am.  Oh...and for those who need malt vinegar, they have it.
Last, and most importantly, the beer selection.  They actually have pretty good beers on tap and a few more in bottles.  Yes, there is a lot of crap too, but as long as there are a few quality craft beers on the menu, I&#39;m happy.  
Overall, this place is OK.  Not a place that I would frequent but not a place that I would avoid altogether either."

This place is smaller then any other Tilted Kilt I&#39;ve been too.  Came here after the monsoon cancelled our golf outing and Indian Lakes around the corner.

I got the chicken tenders, a buddy ordered the wings and another buddy got the ultimate nachos.

The chicken tenders were small, but they were good and the fries that come with it were aight.

The wings I was told were good, but nothin&#39; special...HOWEVER...I have heard that their wings are pretty good from other people, so who knows.

Now, the ultimate nachos were whats up.  Huge plate stacked with a bunch of shiiiii on there.

By that, I mean, I had a snafu with the Groupon that I bought for a party here.  Let me set the scene: it was a week before my birthday, and there was a Groupon for a party for up to 15 people for $150 worth of appetizers for $50.  I called TK to see their availability for the following Tuesday, my birthday.  At this point I hadn&#39;t bought the Groupon because it said you needed to reserve a spot and I needed to make sure they had the room.

So I called up and booked a party for the Tuesday of my birthday.  The woman on the phone said, and I quote &#34;that&#39;ll be a great day to have it because Tuesdays are $2 draft nights&#34;.  Score!  So I THEN bought the Groupon.  She said someone would be calling me back to confirm.  I never got that call.  So I called THEM back and left a message.  I got a voicemail from Vinnie, the GM, saying &#34;I see you booked a party for Tuesday, but you&#39;re going to have to change it because we don&#39;t honor the Groupon on Tuesdays because it&#39;s $2 draft night&#34;.  Ummm...seriously...?

So after a LOT of arguing, they finally decided to honor the Groupon.  Jen was our waitress that night, and she did an AMAZING job!!  We never really had to wait for anything, and she was SO friendly and helpful.  We loved her!

The next time we came in, we had Beth as our waitress, and she was equally as awesome.  Great waitstaff at this location.

However, whoever decided that the side salad should come with the hot meal needs a reality check.  I don&#39;t want to be sitting there eating my cold salad while my food gets equally as cold.

I will definitely be back again, though!!"

I mean, let&#39;s be honest. The only people who&#39;ll complain about a Tilted Kilt (generally) are women who don&#39;t like that there&#39;s a bar where the hosts are attractive women (odds are, more attractive than them), wearing clothing that reminds you that they are extremely attractive. 

Oh sure, they&#39;ll spend a veritable TORRENT of words to try and say otherwise, but ultimately their efforts are futile. In the end, they won&#39;t like the place because there&#39;s a place where there&#39;s pretty girls that aren&#39;t doing anything that lets them point to what they do and say &#34;SHAME! SHAME!&#34; If I had a &#34;masturbatory act&#34; emoticon on Yelp, I&#39;d put it here.

But, I digress... and completely invalidate the whole &#34;I&#39;m Not Going To Write An Extremely Long Review Here&#34; thing. Oh well. On to the review.

As I&#39;ve been to other Tilted Kilts (specifically, Woodridge), I may compare a bit. Not actively; just compared to a bar I strongly enjoy.

TKR (as I&#39;ll call it) is a large bar, which the designers have arranged so that every table / grouping area has its own breathing space. So far, I haven&#39;t seen any situations in which there&#39;s a People Clog or anything.

It does have its downside. A large bar means there&#39;s more room for customers. More customers means there&#39;s a higher Customers To Staff Ratio, meaning service suffers a bit. Tilted Kilts pride themselves on the fact that their servers have time to socialize with their customers. I didn&#39;t see that too often, but I tend to visit at busy times. 

The size of the bar is larger than normal, which &#39;suffers&#39; from the same issue. Now, I&#39;m a Super Fancy High-End Guest who has a Favored Bartender Who Inexplicably Likes Me, so *I* get attention when I require it, but if I was some random schmuck? I could see someone getting annoyed that the bartender has to deal with a higher amount of bar-folks.

I&#39;ve always dug and enjoyed the TK food. You know how people make the joke of &#34;I read Playboy for the articles&#34;? And how the articles in Playboy really ARE good? Well, I actually go to TKs for the food as a primary reason I go. The food is solid.

The only thing I dislike is their pizzas, which are more in the vein of &#39;flatbreads&#39;, meaning they are literally flat breads with stuff on top of it. I miss the pizzas they used to have... and its spread to the other TKs I&#39;ve been to.

Price-wise, things are solid, if a hair expensive. 

Sound-wise, the place can get loud, and when there&#39;s a band... ho boy, it&#39;ll get REALLY FRAKKING LOUD really quick. It can get annoying. 

And now, let&#39;s get to the... obvious section. The women are attractive. If I said anymore, I&#39;d feel like a pervert. Seriously, do you want me to go into how hot the women are? Measurements? Skin type? Seriously, watch a porn or something. As long as you&#39;re not an ass or demanding (and trust me, I&#39;ve seen people do it!), they are nice to you. If they aren&#39;t being nice to you, you&#39;re being an ass, one way or another.

So that concludes my review. Good food, beer is good, women are hot and nice, and you should go. Oh, and if you&#39;re at the bar and your bartender is Susie, tell her Bibs said hi, and that you mentioned how awesome she is on Yelp. Because Susie is awesome. Hell, she&#39;s nice to me. ME, of all people. And I&#39;m a putz."

Average is exactly the experience I get in a TK.  It&#39;s not great, but not horrible, all wrapped in a short skirt and bust-enhancing top.  For years, I&#39;ve maintained that while Hooters has it&#39;s quirky, tongue-in-cheek charm, the food is actually really good and can stand on it&#39;s own feet (hell, my buddies and I have actually done take-out more than once).

In my opinion, Tilted Kilt&#39;s focus on ogling does unfortunately take away from the menu.  While I wouldn&#39;t say any particular item is awful, I also can&#39;t totally recommend anything as most things are just pretty average.  If one is hungry and looking to be fed, there are worse places to go.

Service can be hit or miss.  I&#39;ve noticed sitting at the bar during what would be considered Happy Hour during the week, you can expect prompt service and friendly chatter from staff and other patrons.  Otherwise, it seems like Waitresses pick and choose which tables to dote on and which to just give marginal service.

As I mentioned previously, I&#39;d like to say that this is an isolated instance, but the consistency in what I&#39;ve described above has been in just about all 5 locations I&#39;ve visited.

With that said, it&#39;s not a bad place to get a beer and a burger - but outside of scantily-clad eye-candy, there&#39;s not much to differentiate Tilted Kilt from the throngs of gastro-pubs popping up all over the place... it&#39;s just another contender in the &#34;breastaurant&#34; battles."

It&#39;s just up my street so geographically, it does qualify. We all know why a lot of dudes come here and there shouldn&#39;t be any pretense about it so I won&#39;t dwell on that here. The food is better than average and the drink prices are about standard for a restaurant with similar fare, think Friday&#39;s. So what makes this place almost perfect? Our favorite server Alicia. She is kooky, attentive and adorable. Order the rib-eye version of the Sloppy Jane. It&#39;s a good and messy sandwich. Watch a game or two or three. There&#39;s a screen with what you&#39;re looking for somewhere there. And try to sit up at the bar with your buddies and ask for Alicia to help you out."

This Tilted Kilt has good &amp; attentive service, which is the only reason I even bothered to Yelp it. I&#39;d come here to have a few drinks with some friends but other than that, not much to Yelp about here.

Some friends they are. I had a Black &amp; Bleu burger which was unimpressive at best. The best thing about the meal were the garlic butter french fries and my coke. I am a craft beer lover, and there wasn&#39;t a single great beer on the menu. There were only 3 or 4 good beers on the menu, and then your typical trashy bar type beer.

I walk into the place on a Friday night to ask how long of a wait because the parking lot was full, only come to find out you could sit now, anywhere you wanted. Odd for a &#39;pub&#39; on a Friday night, but whatever. The first thing I noticed, and anyone else would of, is a set of boobs greeting me. If you are going to work in a place where your boobs have to be out, your midriff is showing, wouldn&#39;t you get a tan? I mean it is February in Chicago, and seeing someone as white as milk dressed in nothing much is kind of nasty.

I see some people calling it a sports bar. Just because they have big screens showing sporting events doesn&#39;t make it a sports bar. The screens are horribly placed, unless of course you are at the bar. And why is the music so damn loud? You can&#39;t hold a conversation let alone hear what the waitress has to say.

It is impossible to find a good pub in these parts these days. Winfield, St. Charles, and Geneva is all we have nowadays for good pubs."

We were able to find parking.  They had lots of TV screens and a long bar.  It&#39;s a typical sports bar like atmosphere.  Went here for the first time on St. Patty&#39;s day.  We ended up eating in the beer garden section of the place and yes it was heated.  There&#39;s also another room for the live band.  It was really packed, but the service was still great.  Tina served us and I liked the fact that she also had her name on a coaster since the place was so loud.  I also liked that fact she came by often to see if we were &#34;OK&#34; and if we liked her suggestions off the menu.  She was very knowledgeable with the main meals which is a plus.  She honestly told us during her training, she sampled the food and liked them all.  I tried the Sheppard Pie and I really liked it!  It came in a small heated pot with two slices of fresh garlic bread, so yummy.  The ground meat was well seasoned.  It was thick n hearty and the pot kept is warm for a while.  I couldn&#39;t finish it so I took the rest home.  My hubby also ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.  The fries were crinkled thick and crispy on the outside.  The bread was toasted and the burger patty was pretty big.  He ended up taking that home as well.  I was surprised that their food was really good and it&#39;s not only the good looking people with &#34;Tilted Kilts&#34;.

We actually have a favorite waitress here, Alicia.  Alicia was our waitress for my first visit. (my fiancé had been there before).  Being in the service industry myself I was blown away at her friendly, down to earth, professional service.  She&#39;s the reason we come so frequently!  

Unfortunately we came on her day off earlier this week.  We had a waitress named Sarah, who was a big disappointment.  When we say down there was no &#34;hi&#34; or &#34;how are you guys?&#34;. It was &#34;do u want anything to drink?&#34;. I felt like we were annoying her.  We ordered our drinks and food, ate, and asked for the check.  She placed in on the table, we paid, she asked if we wanted change, we said no, then left.  She didn&#39;t say thank you one time, she made no eye contact, she was super unfriendly, and we were very disappointed. 

Maybe we get spoiled when Alicia waits on us, maybe it was because I was female, I&#39;m not sure but I always overcompensate when it comes to tipping because I rely on tips myself, and Sarah missed out.  I feel like good service should be consistent, and it wasn&#39;t this time. I have no clue how this girl still has a waitress job.

We will definitely be back, but only when Alicia is there in fear that we have the same bad experience."

I had previously been to a few other Tilted Kilts and was pleased with both the food and the service, so I had recommended the restaurant to the others in the group I was with. I was expecting the same in Roselle, and I have to admit I was disappointed.

I was shocked that the place was less than half full - It was a Friday night! 

When we were seated, we were handed menus and the waitress walked away. There was no mention of any food or drink specials.

When the waitress came back to take our order, we ordered pretty basic items from the menu and a few drinks including 2 flights of beer. The only thing not specifically on the menu was a &#34;Bacon Cheeseburger&#34;.  The other items were pretty standard burgers and 1 flat bread order.

When the flights were ordered, we were not advised that some of the options were out, so we did not receive all of the options we wanted. We were only given the option to add beers that we had already ordered in our flights in place of the options that they had run out of. Disappointing, but not the end of the world.

When the food came, 3/4 orders were technically correct. 

1. The flat bread was pretty good - no real complaints there
2. 1 burger came a little under cooked - medium rare instead of medium well. Not a big deal.
3. The burger came out rare instead of medium well. Slightly problematic, but eaten anyway.
4. The bacon cheeseburger that was ordered came as some special burger with fried onions, a special sauce, and peppers on it. What was ordered was a cheeseburger with bacon. When this was mentioned to the server that brought the food, the server said &#34;Oh! That wasn&#39;t me!&#34; and walked away. Our waitress was finally flagged down and the issue was explained. She worked relatively quickly to have a new burger prepared and brought to the table. 

As a whole, the experience was not terrible, but it wasn&#39;t great either.

The food was OK. And beer on tap is beer on tap.

I don&#39;t think we will be returning to this specific Tilted Kilt location since we have had better food elsewhere."

Everyone&#39;s food was pretty good for the most part, I had the simple chicken fingers (some of the best i&#39;ve had) and french fries, which were excellent but a little heavy handed on the seasoning.  

Of course the food is prob secondary to the sights at the TK and this location was no different.  Check it out if you find yourself out here for whatever reason."

You should know what you are getting when you go to any Tilted Kilt (Hooter&#39;s on steroids) and the one in Roselle is executing their plan just fine. The girls are beautiful, friendly, and hard working. They actually earn the tips instead of flaunting around a little cleavage, a lot of attitude, and an expectation that because their shirts are low cut they deserve to be tipped like rock stars. Might be a little risky for family dining but a game and a beer with the boys, or even a date, isn&#39;t out of the question for a fun evening. There is some quality local talent (as customers) for those single folks out there. I also believe their wings are worth the effort and trip.  Looking for to the Oak Brook location opening up!"

The beer selection is fantastic.  Great draft and bottled selection.  Pretty good liquor selection.  Plenty of TV&#39;s, games (billiards and electronic), and it&#39;s a large space overall, so you should only have trouble finding a seat on the busiest of busiest nights.

The food is actually pretty good for a place that doesn&#39;t really market itself for its food.  Some of the apps are quite large, so keep that in mind if you order an app and entree.  Me and a buddy will usually just split an app or two and have a few beers, but the entrees I&#39;ve had have all been good.  I&#39;ve never gotten the meatloaf sandwich, but I&#39;ve been here with multiple people that say that&#39;s the only thing they get because it&#39;s so good.  Never tried any of their desserts, so I can&#39;t comment there.

[Just a side comment.  None of this is factored into my review since this is more of a corporate issue and nothing to do with the Roselle location (but technically I guess that could be said about most of the rest of the experience since it is a chain).]
As for the outfits, I would actually prefer if there were a little more tastefully done.  I&#39;m not bashing the place -- as I said in the beginning, you know what you&#39;re signing up for when you walk through the door.  My point is just that I think most men come here the first time because the outfits are so ridiculously over the top, and many never come back.  It&#39;s a sight to be seen and once seen, they move on.  If the outfits were a little more tasteful, they might increase repeat clientele, AND they might be able to hire girls that are a little more attractive.  I&#39;m not saying the girls here (or at any other TK) aren&#39;t attractive, but you&#39;ll definitely notice all the waitresses (or entertainers as they are supposedly called) are a certain type.

Anyway, it&#39;s a fun place with a good selection of drinks and great promotions."

Uhh then what are you there for just to stand around...? So we went to the bar and waited and barely got service there... Then ohhh then! The bartender didn&#39;t know how to make any kind of drinks! Please tell me why are you a bartender then, I shouldn&#39;t have to tell you how to make a drink! The drinks were so inconsistent too! First they were weak, then to strong and when I asked for a lemon, I was told they were out!

I had heard that Long Grove Cafe had closed down and was very sad. My family has history at LGC, and loved sitting in their dining room because it had such nice ambiance. and love the patio overlooking the pond and the ducks. To lose that was hard. However! I heard that a pizza place moved in. 

I finally took the plunge one night, while in the neighborhood. Ordered for takeout, since i was by myself. There were a few people sitting on the deck with their little dogs (chihuahuas, which means these are my people!) - so i stopped to pet the dogs and say Hi. Turns out the owner, Joanie was one of the people sitting here talking. The cool thing is: Dogs are allowed on the patio. The other cool thing is: Joanie is a GEM! She&#39;s super-sweet and gave me a bit of history. She&#39;s from out of town, moved here to open this restaurant. Her pizza is a family recipe. And apparently they&#39;re going to change the name, because the name is confusing to people &amp; i guess there are other joints around with a similar title... anywho - LOVED chatting with her!! 

Once I got home and cracked open that box - OH MY HEAVEN! Took my first bite and CRACK. The crust actually snaps when you bite into it! YES! I have been searching years for this! And the flavor! Now, I&#39;m a fan of pepperoni, and most jerks put the pepperoni under the cheese - but not here. They put it on top so it gets nice and crispy and palette-ly-pleasing. 

I&#39;ve been here twice since - and it was equally as delicious. 

FYI - they don&#39;t deliver yet, but it&#39;s coming soon!! Sounds like in the next week or two, they should be available on GrubHub.com. (Under their new name: Joanie&#39;s pizza or something). 

And i can&#39;t speak to the restaurant - because i haven&#39;t actually eaten IN, yet. But I hope to soon. Based on the pizza we&#39;ve had now several times, I am very proud that THIS is what took over the Cafe. 

Overall this place is an amazing local, small-business. Highly recommended. Please give it a try!!"

This restaurant is spacious with a much more modern interior than nearby restaurants. Prices are fairly good, portion sizes are good, service is friendly, and flavors are alright.

This restaurant is right next to the water mill and contains a nice water view for the diners. Items on the menu include everything from calzones to pasta to broasted chicken to pizza. On my trip, I tried a wide variety of items and each item was prepared well (in fact, exceeded my expectations).

Baby blue salad - Nice, light and fresh tasting. There was just the right amount of blue cheese as to not overpower the walnuts, dried cherries, and onions. Good texture contrasts between all the ingredients and the vinaigrette tied everything together nicely. 

Mediterranean salad - I originally thought this was going to be overly salty but actually this was rather light and refreshing.  Roma Tomatoes, Greek Olives, Yellow Peppers, Feta Cheese &amp; Balsamic Dressing provided the base heartiness of the salad while Red Onions and Cucumbers added a nice element of crisp freshness to the dish.

Broasted pork chops - A bit salty but the meat was tender and 3 pieces were provided in the dinner. Could&#39;ve used spices or herbs instead to create flavor.

The village pizza - Fresh tasting mushroom, onion, and green pepper but I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the sausage. The thin crust is nice, but nothing special in terms of flavor or texture. Overall, this is one of the better pizzas I&#39;ve had in the area (that aren&#39;t Giordano&#39;s or Lou Malnati&#39;s). 

Cole slaw - Crisp and fresh tasting cabbage, a touch on the sweet side for me.

Broasted chicken wings - Nice and crispy skin, the meat inside is very tender. I wish that there was more marination on the meat and that there were some additional spices on the skin. The chicken has great texture but is fairly bland from a flavor perspective.

Broasted potatoes - Great crispiness, wasn&#39;t too oily, and perfectly seasoned. If there&#39;s only 1 dish you try here -- this would be it.

Breadsticks - Nice and chewy, not too salty -- with just the right amount of butter.

BBQ ribs -- nice size portion for the price. The meat is fairly tender and falls right off the bone although it could be a little bit more juicy. The meat wasn&#39;t really marinated at all and relies completely on the sauce for flavor -- but that&#39;s not really unexpected with prices this low.

Chicken Parmesan Calzone -- It was actually like a giant hot pocket surrounding a very light chicken parmesan. It looks really unhealthy but the breading was very similar to the one used in the breadsticks and made the dish a lot lighter than expected since the chicken wasn&#39;t overly salted and had the right amount of cheese to go with it.

Cream cheese jalapeno poppers, chicken tenders, breaded mushrooms, and onion rings: Nothing really special to talk about here. Pretty standard preparation that wasn&#39;t particularly good but wasn&#39;t bad either. Of these items, the chicken tenders was the most surprising with how tender the chicken was inside.

If you&#39;re in the area, definitely check out this restaurant. Great for a small meal just for yourself but also has a surprisingly large number of bulk ordering options. Overall, nice textures -- especially on fried food and the bread but could use a little refinement in flavors and presentation. They also have Karaoke at 7:00 pm on Wednesday evenings if you need a change of pace from Fox &amp; Hound in Arlington Heights."

They have a small but unique selection of beers, and our server recommended something and unique which I enjoyed very much. We stuck with the pizza this time and it was great. We shared a Mediterranean chicken thin crust pizza which has garlic butter sauce, chicken, red onion, tomato, banana peppers and oregano, plus mozzerella and feta cheeses. It was delish and a medium was the right size for a couple to share. The crust was extra thin and crispy and not soggy. Kids each had a personal sized kids pizza, which was a great size they could have shared if we&#39;d ordered an appetizer of some sort first. This pizza was their thicker dough (I think they call it &#34;round&#34;) and was nice and chewy with a puffy crust. They really enjoyed their pizza and gobbled it up. The other menu items around us looked great from the pan (square) pizza to the ribs to the fried chicken. The atmosphere was great, lots of families and busy without being crazy and overly loud.

We arrived there on Friday night and it was semi busy got a table in a good amount of time and that was the only good part. Our waiter granted nice was slow and seemed very stressed.  Our app came out with 10 minutes I ordered a salad my fiance a sandwich chicken breast and a small pizza.  My salad came out first about 28 min into our time there they said the rest of the food will be right out.  Nope 12 min later my fiance gets his side of chicken breast only..  Mind you our 8 year old daughter is starving still no food...  We tell them to take it back since the chicken will get cold and this is getting ridiculous.  Literally 10 minutes later the pizza comes still no sandwich for my fiance.  I asked to speak to the owner 2 times which I was told they are slammed in the kitchen and are short staffed so the owners can&#39;t come out both are on the line....  Unacceptable!  I have never heard that before no you have a manager in FOH at all times for these reasons. Then 8 min after that my fiance food came out.  Needless to say he was pissed!!  He walked out I told the server we don&#39;t want any of this anymore we will pay for what we ate but nothing else.  Finally the owner comes out was nice and took my number and said she would call me asap so we can try them again etc.  Well no phone call as of yet from the restaurant. What a shame from what we tasted the food was good but honestly they will fail if they can&#39;t get there staff together and kitchen.  They were not that slammed.  Very bad experience.

So, we stopped in during the local Chocolate Fest and were seated promptly.  It wasn&#39;t terribly busy as there were many open tables and several of the waitstaff hovering near the entrance.  The server brought our drinks right away and we ordered our meals.  They had a special festival menu that was VERY limited.  Salads for about $9 each (none had chicken or protein atop), a small pizza or mostaccoli.  After our party of 8 ordered, we were brought 4 of the 8 entrees.  10 minutes later, 2 more of the salads came, 8 minutes later 2 more entrees came.  There was a total of 18 minutes between the first meals brought out to the last ones.  We asked the server to speak with the manager and he did come out.  I guess one of the cooks quit?? and they were understaffed in the kitchen.  We asked for rolls or something with the salads and he did bring out some very good and fresh breadsticks.  The server and manager were both very apologetic.  The salads were tasty but in a cereal sized plastic, disposable bowl.  The dressing was in a disposable ramekin.  The mostaccoli was in individual foil containers.  Just an odd experience overall."

Naturally, we were excited about a pizza place that served broasted chicken!
We ordered broasted chicken with potato wedges and chicken fingers for our granddaughter.

What a dissappointment.  The deck was full so we ate inside.  There was food on the carpeting from the previous diners.  Ok, not crumbs but large pieces of lettuce, pizza crust, etc.  Really, no one saw this?  Or picked it up?

The broasted chicken was pretty disgusting.  The batter was really thick , greasy and not crispy. Our wedge potatoes were not freshly made.  And the chicken tenders were also sitting around.

After reading the other reviews, we obviously ordered the wrong thing.
I woudnt go back, too many good pizza joints around and best bbq is in third lake, BBQd Productions.

The place overall falls in the genre of what I would call a &#34;Mexican lounge&#34; as they have a pool table and other games too. The walls are bright blue and the service is  accommodating and quite friendly.

 readily available.

Oh, and as for my food, I had the enchiladas verde and they were perfect. 

I have a typical baseline expectation for most American mexican restaurants. Please don&#39;t be terrible or get me sick. I have been to enough.

It&#39;s just way better here.  Is it gourmet nuevo mexicano? No. But it is as good as traditional mexican american gets. 

I suspect if more people told Delia they want nuevo mexicano, she would do it. Just patronize her and help her grow!"

Two doors down was La Malinche so we decided to check them out. We were the only people in the restaurant the entire time we were there. No one even came in to pick up food. Bad sign #1! The waitress brought us an array of different salsas (3 of them). All were way too spicy (I was hoping one would be at least mildly spicy) and totally &#34;off&#34; - none of them were anything like we&#39;ve ever tasted before. The 4th container was filled with pickled vegetables (jalapenos, carrots, onion) and it had a long, black hair in it! We were so repulsed and in hindsight, we should&#39;ve went and got our waitress (she had disappeared in back). We picked it out and didn&#39;t finish eating any of these salsas! We didn&#39;t say anything to the waitress either when she brought our food out...again, I know that was our mistake.

The food was mediocre. I had the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. I&#39;m a mole aficienado and this was just &#34;OK&#34;. The rice was totally bland and tasteless. My husband had the steak burrito and he too said it was just &#34;OK&#34;. He said the burritos at Tacos El Norte are much better.

I woke up very early this morning with terrible stomach pain and my husband had intestinal problems, too! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!

Go to Tacos El Norte instead - decent mexican food, clean (have never found a hair in our food!), and have never gotten sick there."

The restaurant is located in a shopping area with some boutique stores, as well as a decent water front. We walked in the back door. The staff seemed courteous and guided us to the front, at which time we were seated promptly, it was around 6p. We found the interior quaint, with wooden construction, shields on the wall, &#34;dungeon&#34; looking bars in one area, and stained glass windows. 
The waitress was polite and friendly, she brought popcorn, and we requested bread and butter, which was served warm. 
We ordered the quarter rack of ribs for kids, fish and chips, and a sirloin steak medium rare. The ribs were tender, and tasty. The fish and chips seemed the best dish, and the steak, though medium rare and served with au jus, was ok. 
From our observation, it seemed that many locals enjoy this restaurant. The patrons and many of the staff knew each other and were warm and friendly. I&#39;d recommend this place to anyone stopping through West Dundee. Cheers!"

He told me the chicken fingers had an option for appetizer or dinner. I asked the difference between the two and he said the dinner comes with more fingers and a side, while appetizer is just fingers, and less of them. I asked how many each came with and he didn&#39;t know. Turns out the appetizer has 4 while the dinner has 5. He told me the appetizer was about half the price as the dinner (dinner was 11 dollars)-- so I ordered the appetizer, but before making it final, I asked how much it was. 9 dollars.. That&#39;s not half of 11 by any means. 2 dollars? I went with the dinner.

Terrible choice. 13 dollars after tax and not only are the chicken fingers small (more bread than chicken), but they&#39;re extremely dry. The fries were ok, but the soup they included tasted like nothing and the chicken inside of it had a mild sour aftertaste. 

They&#39;re also extremely skimpy. The soup bowl was filled only half way, and the dipping sauce was also small.

9 dollars for 4 thin and dry chicken fingers? 13 for 5? These things are honestly worse than Burger King chicken nuggets. 

The guy on the phone also told me that they hand batter them (I asked if they were battered or breadcrumb, he said they hand batter them)-- they&#39;re breadcrumb. 

First and last time I will ever go here. I&#39;m assuming this is appealing to those that visit the bar section of this place first, because this is pretty good drunk people food, and definitely drunk people prices."

The saganaki is also amazing and entertaining when they serve it. 

The only reason I can&#39;t give 5 stars to this place is because they need better TV&#39;s in the bar area. They do have a TV or 2, but it is small and I like to watch sports so that is no bueno. The atmosphere is cool though with usually live acoustic music on Friday and Saturday nights."

Though the medieval theme can seem a little corny at times, I would contend that the village squire does not necessarily count as a themed restaurant rather than an old style pub concerning the atmosphere. As for the food, I have not necessarily been amazed, but I have never been disappointed here. They offer mostly your standard bar and grill food, but the pizzas are worth trying, and the saganaki is both entertaining and delicious. I would recommend it as a place for a casual get together with friends, but probably not a place to take a date. The food didn&#39;t take too long to come out, about 20-25 minutes, though maybe longer depending on the dish and the service was always satisfactory."

Don&#39;t even think of carrying out from here, either.  You will get the burned ribs, drowned in sauce, old fries, etc.

Also, the bar area is very small and why they allow a group of people gather around the bar and stand directly in front of the door, blocking people coming in and out, is beyond me.

I arrived to the squire today at 11:20 assuming they opened at 11am. When we arrived we walked up and saw the sign telling us they opened at 11:30, no big deal, our fault. My wife quickly checked the website and it stated they opened at noon, whatever. By 11:30 there was a small group of people waiting by the door. By 11:35 I knocked on the door and there was no answer. The older couple waiting near us then called the restaurant and finally they came to open the doors. 

When we walked in there was no one at the waitstand and a couple of waitresses working on the daily special board. I finally walked up and asked if we could sit anywhere and without even turning around one of them said yes. 

Our waitress came over and greeted us promptly, took our drink order and disappeared for 5 minutes. She finally came back with our drinks and took our order. My soup came quickly and wasn&#39;t bad. Since golf was on tv we ended up sitting in a bar booth. During our 20 minute wait for our food we could hear the bartender talking about an employee that had been stealing and was fired with one of her customers....ahhh ambiance!

Our food was delivered and I noticed they had made me the California chicken sandwich and not the Cajun chicken sandwich that I had ordered. I pointed the error out to the waitress when she finally came back to check on us. She said sorry and went to correct the issue. She returned back 3-4 minutes later with the correct sandwich. Since the chicken breast didn&#39;t have the Cajun spices as advertised I asked if this was the same breast used for the California sandwich?  She said she didn&#39;t know. I told her I was allergic to avocado and needed to know. She grabbed my plate and said let me check. After about 10 minutes I assumed they were grilling me a new chicken breast but wasn&#39;t sure since she never came back. 

20 minutes later, after my entire family was done eating, a female manager brought my plate and asked &#34;does this look right?&#34; In a tone insinuating I was being difficult. I responded &#34;yes, it appears to be just like the description of the sandwich I ordered from your menu.&#34;  She said, &#34;don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll give you a discount.&#34;

When the check arrived I immediately gave the waitress my credit card but kept the receipt to review. They had taken $5 off of the bill but had also charged me for drinks that were supposed to have been included with the kids meals. By this point I was done with this place and didn&#39;t even bring it to their attention. 

I&#39;ve eaten at the squire in crystal lake and never had a problem. It seems that the C team must be sent to Dundee!!  Stay away!!"

The Village Squire in West Dundee has a lot going for it, the ambiance, the people and yes some of the food.  However, there are some things that you just have to shake your head and wonder who is in charge of the menu,    

Whoever that person is, they deserved to be dressed down by Gordon Ramsey because there is no way this pizza can even be considered close to on par with the surrounding Pizzerias.    I&#39;m sorry but I am a pizza fanatic.  I travel far and wide for a good pie, so when I come across food like this is just pisses me off.  

If you think about it, it is insulting how restaurants continually push out sub par food and expect customer to shell out dollars for it.  Why do restaurants continually treat pizzas as if they are the doormat of the menu?  

Unfortunately, most of the time what you get from restaurant pizzas, are pizzas with bland sauce, and toppings that are fine, but clearly nothing with any depth of flavor (i.e. pepperoni, italian sausage with fennel seeds). 

So am I being overly demanding?  I don&#39;t think so!  

The Village Squire pizza will be presented to you by your server as &#34;excellent&#34; but trust me, it is nothing close to excellent.  At best, it is what you would expect to be served at a late night buffet or from Golden Corral.  

===========================================================

Pros:  The crust is a nice cracker type and very thin. It wasn&#39;t mushy and not so thick that if fills you up before you have even gotten your second piece down.  The Mozzarella cheese is generous. .  
 
Cons:  The toppings were very average ingredients.  Seasoning was nothing special other than what you can add at the table with parmesan cheese and red flake pepper.  The sauce has no soul, far too thin, bland and makes no contribution to the overall flavor.  It almost just floats there to provide some moisture between the cheese and the crust.  The sauce is so absent any kind of flavor that you find yourself looking to the crust, seasoning and toppings to win your taste buds over - sadly that just isn&#39;t possible.  

===========================================================

If a restaurant is going to offer pizza on their menu, then damn it make a real effort to produce a product that makes people want to come back!  Here is a tip for the owners of the Village Squire.  

Go find the top three pizzas in your area, do some sampling and testing with your patrons and use the feedback to craft something you can feel proud to offer, and that your customers can truly look forward to enjoying.  Then offer that pizza on your menu, even if it is only once a week and cost a bit more - just so long as it doesn&#39;t suck.   

Yes, I am putting it out there.  The pizza at the Village Squire just flat out sucks...period. Unless you were born without taste buds or you have a leather belt for a tongue, the pizza is that lousy.   Dominos pizza tastes a hell of a lot better!   

My rating of one star reflects how lousy the pizza is at the Village Squire.  Please do not consider it a rating for all of the other items on their menu, which I have eaten and enjoyed thoroughly.  They do have some very good food here. 

I dropped $90 for lunch for two today. That price included three house drinks from the bar and a generous tip.   The server was competent, the people friendly, the bar drinks were well poured, an the ambiance - warm and inviting.   

Just make sure you steer clear of pizza and you should come away happy if you decide to eat at the Village Squire of West Dundee."

They have ribs for the rib fans, french dip sandwiches, which is also on my favorite list, and burgers and chicken fingers for the kids. They even have Gyros and which are really good. It&#39;s like the perfect restaurant. You can take your loud, obnoxious family, like us, or go there on a first date. 

Oh, did I mention that they still give you bread with your soup and salads in addition to the popcorn? They really fill you up here. The prices are reasonable and the service is pretty decent. Bathrooms are a bit dated, but clean."

They&#39;ve recently &#34;remodeled&#34; the place, but it looks more like they just disinfected the years of grease off the walls. I noticed gum stuck on the wood wall behind where my son was sitting and decided not to point this out to him as it&#39;s pretty unappetizing. They&#39;ve also turned the lights on so you can see your food and dinner guests. So, I guess this is an improvement over their former dungeon atmosphere.

I went with my son, who wanted buffalo wings as an entree. It was only offered as an appetizer, so I doubled the order knowing that he can put down a lot of wings.

I ordered the veggie wrap. The veggie wrap was okay, not much to it. 

My son&#39;s buffalo wings though -- they were exactly like the cheapo Banquet kind you get in the frozen aisle at the grocery store and the sauce was weird. The consistency was off and even my son, who&#39;s not picky couldn&#39;t stomach them. He ate a few, trying to hide his disgust when I finally said to him, &#34;You hate those, don&#39;t you?&#34; To which he responded, &#34;They&#39;re awful&#34;.

So, then I wait for the waitress to come back. I wait and wait and wait. My son is now drinking my drink because he&#39;s so thirsty and nobody has been back to our table in an unacceptable amount of time. So, finally the waitress comes back and I tell her how awful the wings are. I told her that he forced himself to eat a couple but didn&#39;t like them at all. 

Guess what her response was. Go on, guess. 

She said, &#34;Oh, okay. Would you like a box so that you can bring them home with you?&#34;

Seriously?????

I left her a $2 tip, which was $1.99 too much. She never offered to send over a manager or ask if my son, who was starving, wanted something else, she simply didn&#39;t give a $#@. I wrote on the receipt &#34;Horrible Wings&#34;, so that she would get the message that the tip was more about how poorly she handled the situation. So, $32 dollars later, my son and I left -- he hungry and me slightly more satisfied than Wendys fast food.

Do not waste your money here. I think the only reason it&#39;s busy is because you can be loud and bring kids without people complaining. The service is horrible and the food is sub-par. And if you find yourself being talked in to going by somebody who doesn&#39;t know better, DO NOT order the wings and DO NOT expect anybody to care about your experience there. 

My recommendation, just skip it. Go to Emmets next door. 

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"

The wife and I have been regulars for years and enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service. However, the last 2 times have been terrible. We went back after the first terrible experience thinking everyone has a bad day but last night (3/2/2013) was just a bad experience. After we ordered it took a very long time for our soup and salad to arrive, so long in fact, 2of the dinners arrived within a minute of our salads. We asked them to take the dinner&#39;s back and provide fresh  ones after we were were done with our salad&#39;s just stuck our dinners under a heat lamp and then served them to us later. That was the worst fish and chips we ever had. Another person in our party ordered a rare piece of prime rib that came to our table medium at best.  The waitress knew we were displeased and informed us the drinks would be on the house. A little consolation but a nice gesture. But when we received the check the drinks were on it and we paid in full for what was a waste of our hard earned money.  Now were on the search for a new local hangout.  Every thing changes eventually an the food and service definitely changed at the West Dundee Village Squire.  When in doubt....don&#39;t go.

We made another visit on Saturday evening.  There were six of us dining and four of us ordered Fried Chicken.  The other meals ordered were a Western Burger with french fries and Prime Rib.  We started with the &#34;Stinky Cheese Appetizer&#34; - sorry, I can&#39;t spell the proper name right and I am not a fan of this wildly famous food, so &#34;SCA&#34; it will remain in my book.  We also had a combo app with onion rings, chicken wings, chicken fingers and cheese sticks.  A lot of fried food, but it was a treat and it was yummy!  My step-mom had a salad with her dinner and everyone else had the french onion soup.   This soup is really growing on me and I was starting to wish that the bowl was bigger because it was really good on Saturday!  Oh and the rolls were nice and warm, too.

Here&#39;s where we had a bit of a problem.  Overall, our waitress had been great - attentive, kept our glasses full, brought extra napkins, etc.  But, my sister&#39;s fried chicken arrived and when she cut into it, it was ice cold in the center.  Not, cool like it had been sitting too long waiting to be served, but cold like it had just come out of the refrigerator.  Since she knows that she can be a bit dramatic she had me touch the inside of the chicken breast and she was right on the money.  The waitress arrived back to check on us right away and when my sister pointed this out, the waitress had her put the chicken in a napkin that the waitress was holding, so she could go back and put it in the fryer again.  Weird.  How about removing the plate and corrected the issue in a more sanitary way?  And well, it was not such a good idea because when the chicken came back, it was fried extra, extra crispy and since the breasts had been cut into to check the temperature, the meat was all crispy and dry, too.  This was not enough to keep me from returning or drop them a star because I think it was an accident and not the restaurant&#39;s normal practice, but I am hopeful that this doesn&#39;t happen again."

Everything was just as the 3-star rating says &#34;A-OK&#34;.  Not really stand-out and not bad.  It was just sort of typical food!  The lighting/ambiance is VERY dim, but I guess that&#39;s there &#34;thang&#34; so it&#39;s cool.

We started by ordering drinks--they do get props from me for having diet Sprite-not many places do.  Mixed with the apple vodka, it was a deliciously strong little number!  My friend got a raspberry daquiri, and that was delicious as well.

For our meal, we both ordered the french onion soup to start.  It was just...ok.  I don&#39;t really know how to describe it other than &#34;Friday&#39;s does it better&#34;.  I had a side salad that came with a plethora of mushrooms (yum) and after perusing the extensive menu, I decided to get the broiled chicken breast sandwich and steak fries, and my friend got a burger and fries.

Both of the sandwiches were just OK, and the fries were typical steak fries.  Not really any seasoning on them, but they were hot and they helped soak up the heavy pour of my alcoholic beverage, so they did the trick.

The &#34;barrel&#34; drinks did look delicious, so if I do go back, I will order one of those!"

While ordering drinks, my 89 year old grandfather was told by our waitress that he could not have a beer because he did not have his drivers license.  She tried to get into an argument with my family that other local restaurants and stores require a drivers license for all individuals including senior citizens who are obviously over 21 years of age.  After some scolding from the waitress, my grandfather was finally allowed to have a beer after my family pleaded that he was obviously over 21 years of age since his grandchildren were over 21 years of age.

After about 5 minutes the waitress brought half of the beverages, but forgot about the other half of the beverages.  While waiting for our drinks, we saw our waitress serving other tables before she brought us the rest of our drinks.  My brother ordered pepsi/coke, and the waitress brought him diet pepsi/coke.  My brother tried to explain in a very polite manner to the waitress that he was served the wrong drink, and the waitress proceeded by dumping a partial basket of popcorn on my brother&#39;s head telling my brother that he was a liar.  We were about ready to ask to talk to the manager, but my grandfather asked us not to because he wanted to have a nice dinner, focusing on our nice conversations rather than the poor service.

We then decided to order appetizers.  The waitress dropped the appetizers on the table.  The Saganaki was still on fire when the food was dropped on our table, so this startled my family of 7 folks.  We ordered two Saganaki dishes, but were only given 4 small pieces of bread, so we tried to order more bread to go with the Saganaki.  The waitress then tried to start another argument claiming that extra bread will be incrementally more expensive because we are ordering this bread after we ordered the Saganaki.  She again scolded us by telling us to order extra bread before the Saganaki comes to the table, otherwise we&#39;re forced to pay higher prices.  I don&#39;t understand why the price of bread fluctuates throughout the course of dinner, and I don&#39;t understand why a table of 7 is only provided with 4 small pieces of bread with 2 orders of Saganaki.  

After appetizers were provided, it seemed like the waitress forgot about us because we did not receive any drink refills or order food for at least 20 minutes.  Dinner also took a long time to receive, but the food was tasty; I ordered the steak sandwich.  However, I wish I was served more french fries though.

At this point we were in the restaurant for nearly 2 hours and 30 minute, so we didn&#39;t bother to order dessert because we were anxious to go home.  

When the check came to our table, my father tried to give the waitress his credit card immediately, but the waitress told my dad to &#34;hold his-horses&#34;, and that she would be back shortly.  I think she forgot about us (again) because we waited about 10 minutes to pay our dinner.

In summary, we spent well-over 2 hours and 30 minutes in the West Dundee Village Squire because service was very slow and we were ignored.  Throughout dinner service, the waitress was continuously very slow to refill our drinks and order our food.  She tried to get into arguments over everything, and it was very clear that our waitress did not wish to be at work by her attitude.  The waitress was rude to everyone at my table, and creeped me out.  Although the food was tasty, I really felt uncomfortable eating food that this older and grouchy waitress touched because of her negative attitude and completely unprofessional behavior.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll eat here again, at least not by my recommendation."

We&#39;ve driven by this location several times and often see crowds making its way into this restaurant by the Fox River.
We eventually had the opportunity one Sunday afternoon. We asked to see the menu and thought it was a German restaurant, but we were wrong. They were just celebrating Octoberfest like every place.
The food, like the other reviewers mentioned, were average at an average price.
Being Buffalo Wings connoisseurs, I have to say this is the best wings we&#39;ve found in the burbs. The sauce is creamy and has good kick to it. It&#39;s the first time I ever had to dip my wings into the bleu cheese dressing.
We order the BBQ ribs and fried chicken. They were fairly good. The prime rib was also well passable. The vegetables were a big miss, though. They were too waterlogged.
If I were to return, it&#39;d certainly be for the wings."

There are great specials like 1/2 price burgers and 50 cent chicken fingers on Tuesdays. Another night is 1/2 price gyros, etc.  The Squire has amazing chicken fingers that are definitely hand dipped and while I am not a fan of fried food I cannot resist them!    The turkey burger is the best I have ever had and comes with a chipotle cranberry mayo. YUM.     Bartenders are wonderful and so are the servers.  I highly recommend this place for a casual, kick back and relax time."

The waitresses are usually pretty nice. They serve popcorn to every table like how Mexican restaurants serve chips and salsa. Food wasn&#39;t to bad. The burger I had was a little bland. And the prices seemed to be a little over the top.

They&#39;ve recently &#34;remodeled&#34; the place, but it looks more like they just disinfected the years of grease off the walls. I noticed gum stuck on the wood wall behind where my son was sitting and decided not to point this out to him as it&#39;s pretty unappetizing. They&#39;ve also turned the lights on so you can see your food and dinner guests. So, I guess this is an improvement over their former dungeon atmosphere.

I went with my son, who wanted buffalo wings as an entree. It was only offered as an appetizer, so I doubled the order knowing that he can put down a lot of wings.

I ordered the veggie wrap. The veggie wrap was okay, not much to it. 

My son&#39;s buffalo wings though -- they were exactly like the cheapo Banquet kind you get in the frozen aisle at the grocery store and the sauce was weird. The consistency was off and even my son, who&#39;s not picky couldn&#39;t stomach them. He ate a few, trying to hide his disgust when I finally said to him, &#34;You hate those, don&#39;t you?&#34; To which he responded, &#34;They&#39;re awful&#34;.

So, then I wait for the waitress to come back. I wait and wait and wait. My son is now drinking my drink because he&#39;s so thirsty and nobody has been back to our table in an unacceptable amount of time. So, finally the waitress comes back and I tell her how awful the wings are. I told her that he forced himself to eat a couple but didn&#39;t like them at all. 

Guess what her response was. Go on, guess. 

She said, &#34;Oh, okay. Would you like a box so that you can bring them home with you?&#34;

Seriously?????

I left her a $2 tip, which was $1.99 too much. She never offered to send over a manager or ask if my son, who was starving, wanted something else, she simply didn&#39;t give a $#@. I wrote on the receipt &#34;Horrible Wings&#34;, so that she would get the message that the tip was more about how poorly she handled the situation. So, $32 dollars later, my son and I left -- he hungry and me slightly more satisfied than Wendys fast food.

Do not waste your money here. I think the only reason it&#39;s busy is because you can be loud and bring kids without people complaining. The service is horrible and the food is sub-par. And if you find yourself being talked in to going by somebody who doesn&#39;t know better, DO NOT order the wings and DO NOT expect anybody to care about your experience there. 

My recommendation, just skip it. Go to Emmets next door. 

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"

The wife and I have been regulars for years and enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service. However, the last 2 times have been terrible. We went back after the first terrible experience thinking everyone has a bad day but last night (3/2/2013) was just a bad experience. After we ordered it took a very long time for our soup and salad to arrive, so long in fact, 2of the dinners arrived within a minute of our salads. We asked them to take the dinner&#39;s back and provide fresh  ones after we were were done with our salad&#39;s just stuck our dinners under a heat lamp and then served them to us later. That was the worst fish and chips we ever had. Another person in our party ordered a rare piece of prime rib that came to our table medium at best.  The waitress knew we were displeased and informed us the drinks would be on the house. A little consolation but a nice gesture. But when we received the check the drinks were on it and we paid in full for what was a waste of our hard earned money.  Now were on the search for a new local hangout.  Every thing changes eventually an the food and service definitely changed at the West Dundee Village Squire.  When in doubt....don&#39;t go.

We made another visit on Saturday evening.  There were six of us dining and four of us ordered Fried Chicken.  The other meals ordered were a Western Burger with french fries and Prime Rib.  We started with the &#34;Stinky Cheese Appetizer&#34; - sorry, I can&#39;t spell the proper name right and I am not a fan of this wildly famous food, so &#34;SCA&#34; it will remain in my book.  We also had a combo app with onion rings, chicken wings, chicken fingers and cheese sticks.  A lot of fried food, but it was a treat and it was yummy!  My step-mom had a salad with her dinner and everyone else had the french onion soup.   This soup is really growing on me and I was starting to wish that the bowl was bigger because it was really good on Saturday!  Oh and the rolls were nice and warm, too.

Here&#39;s where we had a bit of a problem.  Overall, our waitress had been great - attentive, kept our glasses full, brought extra napkins, etc.  But, my sister&#39;s fried chicken arrived and when she cut into it, it was ice cold in the center.  Not, cool like it had been sitting too long waiting to be served, but cold like it had just come out of the refrigerator.  Since she knows that she can be a bit dramatic she had me touch the inside of the chicken breast and she was right on the money.  The waitress arrived back to check on us right away and when my sister pointed this out, the waitress had her put the chicken in a napkin that the waitress was holding, so she could go back and put it in the fryer again.  Weird.  How about removing the plate and corrected the issue in a more sanitary way?  And well, it was not such a good idea because when the chicken came back, it was fried extra, extra crispy and since the breasts had been cut into to check the temperature, the meat was all crispy and dry, too.  This was not enough to keep me from returning or drop them a star because I think it was an accident and not the restaurant&#39;s normal practice, but I am hopeful that this doesn&#39;t happen again."

Everything was just as the 3-star rating says &#34;A-OK&#34;.  Not really stand-out and not bad.  It was just sort of typical food!  The lighting/ambiance is VERY dim, but I guess that&#39;s there &#34;thang&#34; so it&#39;s cool.

We started by ordering drinks--they do get props from me for having diet Sprite-not many places do.  Mixed with the apple vodka, it was a deliciously strong little number!  My friend got a raspberry daquiri, and that was delicious as well.

For our meal, we both ordered the french onion soup to start.  It was just...ok.  I don&#39;t really know how to describe it other than &#34;Friday&#39;s does it better&#34;.  I had a side salad that came with a plethora of mushrooms (yum) and after perusing the extensive menu, I decided to get the broiled chicken breast sandwich and steak fries, and my friend got a burger and fries.

Both of the sandwiches were just OK, and the fries were typical steak fries.  Not really any seasoning on them, but they were hot and they helped soak up the heavy pour of my alcoholic beverage, so they did the trick.

The &#34;barrel&#34; drinks did look delicious, so if I do go back, I will order one of those!"

The perch was 50% fried breading.  Tried haed to find any actual fish.  A drunk from another table opened the emergency door and set off the fire alarm. Fun stuff.

While ordering drinks, my 89 year old grandfather was told by our waitress that he could not have a beer because he did not have his drivers license.  She tried to get into an argument with my family that other local restaurants and stores require a drivers license for all individuals including senior citizens who are obviously over 21 years of age.  After some scolding from the waitress, my grandfather was finally allowed to have a beer after my family pleaded that he was obviously over 21 years of age since his grandchildren were over 21 years of age.

After about 5 minutes the waitress brought half of the beverages, but forgot about the other half of the beverages.  While waiting for our drinks, we saw our waitress serving other tables before she brought us the rest of our drinks.  My brother ordered pepsi/coke, and the waitress brought him diet pepsi/coke.  My brother tried to explain in a very polite manner to the waitress that he was served the wrong drink, and the waitress proceeded by dumping a partial basket of popcorn on my brother&#39;s head telling my brother that he was a liar.  We were about ready to ask to talk to the manager, but my grandfather asked us not to because he wanted to have a nice dinner, focusing on our nice conversations rather than the poor service.

We then decided to order appetizers.  The waitress dropped the appetizers on the table.  The Saganaki was still on fire when the food was dropped on our table, so this startled my family of 7 folks.  We ordered two Saganaki dishes, but were only given 4 small pieces of bread, so we tried to order more bread to go with the Saganaki.  The waitress then tried to start another argument claiming that extra bread will be incrementally more expensive because we are ordering this bread after we ordered the Saganaki.  She again scolded us by telling us to order extra bread before the Saganaki comes to the table, otherwise we&#39;re forced to pay higher prices.  I don&#39;t understand why the price of bread fluctuates throughout the course of dinner, and I don&#39;t understand why a table of 7 is only provided with 4 small pieces of bread with 2 orders of Saganaki.  

After appetizers were provided, it seemed like the waitress forgot about us because we did not receive any drink refills or order food for at least 20 minutes.  Dinner also took a long time to receive, but the food was tasty; I ordered the steak sandwich.  However, I wish I was served more french fries though.

At this point we were in the restaurant for nearly 2 hours and 30 minute, so we didn&#39;t bother to order dessert because we were anxious to go home.  

When the check came to our table, my father tried to give the waitress his credit card immediately, but the waitress told my dad to &#34;hold his-horses&#34;, and that she would be back shortly.  I think she forgot about us (again) because we waited about 10 minutes to pay our dinner.

In summary, we spent well-over 2 hours and 30 minutes in the West Dundee Village Squire because service was very slow and we were ignored.  Throughout dinner service, the waitress was continuously very slow to refill our drinks and order our food.  She tried to get into arguments over everything, and it was very clear that our waitress did not wish to be at work by her attitude.  The waitress was rude to everyone at my table, and creeped me out.  Although the food was tasty, I really felt uncomfortable eating food that this older and grouchy waitress touched because of her negative attitude and completely unprofessional behavior.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll eat here again, at least not by my recommendation."

We&#39;ve driven by this location several times and often see crowds making its way into this restaurant by the Fox River.
We eventually had the opportunity one Sunday afternoon. We asked to see the menu and thought it was a German restaurant, but we were wrong. They were just celebrating Octoberfest like every place.
The food, like the other reviewers mentioned, were average at an average price.
Being Buffalo Wings connoisseurs, I have to say this is the best wings we&#39;ve found in the burbs. The sauce is creamy and has good kick to it. It&#39;s the first time I ever had to dip my wings into the bleu cheese dressing.
We order the BBQ ribs and fried chicken. They were fairly good. The prime rib was also well passable. The vegetables were a big miss, though. They were too waterlogged.
If I were to return, it&#39;d certainly be for the wings."

Maybe it was the switch from peanuts to popcorn in the early &#39;80&#39;s that started it, I don&#39;t know but they used to have such great service and such good food.  Now, it seems no different than any other chain that you could find on the outer perimeter of any mall, in any city, in any state.

Gone are the matronly waitresses that called you &#34;honey&#34; and &#34;sweetie&#34;, in with the dude greeting two women with &#34;hey guys, what are ya drinking?&#34;.  Ugh.  The pizza isn&#39;t the same either.  Now its tasting like prefabbed canned sauce, low moisture skim mozz on cardboard with mass produced, flavorless pepperoni and sausage.  Its not horrible, but it used to be a lot better.

You can always get a predictable meal at the Squire.  It is by no means the best food around, but not a bad meal either.  Cocktails are excellent if Mary is tending bar.  Service is excellent if Sandi is the server.  Other servers are spotty.  You can either draw a good one, or you can end up with one of the worst.  Most of the food items are good.  Occasionally the kitchen is a bit spotty as well.  Sometimes steaks are overcooked.  

They offer live entertainment each night.  Some nights are better than others.

My lovely girlfriend Robin and I started off with some Mai Tais and Saganaki! Saganaki is really tasty flaming goat cheese! I highly recommend you eat it! 

We ordered a pepperoni pizza. The cheese here is actual cheese. Not the BS fake plastic-like cheese that you will get at other places. Most pizza places (ie.pizza hut, papa johns) nowadays use REAL brandname cheese which is actually not &#39;real&#39; cheese. So I&#39;ve always loved their pizza.

My husband got the chicken alfredo and I&#39;m telling you, it really tasted like nothing. I actually really liked my fish sandwich, it was huge but tasted as expected. They have some good drink specials. I got one of their rum runners and I liked it but was pretty sweet and I couldn&#39;t taste much alcohol in it.

Parking lot was large and when we walked inside we knew why. There was a waiting line to get in - yes it was a Friday - we waited perhaps 5-10 minutes then were shown to our table. Past the bar and back in the corner. Nice cozy corner with just enough room for the 4 of us. The place was nice and a good family atmosphere. The food was good with leftovers for later. If it wasn&#39;t for the drive - we would go there again. I would recommend this place for dinner. Be ready for the crowds on the weekends.

I&#39;ve never had a problem here and the food has always been good. They have one tradition here which I&#39;ve actually never tried and that is their flaming cheese. It looks cool, but I&#39;m not sure how it tastes. 

The atmosphere is sort of like a bar, and they have live music every now and then from what I&#39;ve gathered from some ads they have in their foyer, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been around to hear it. 

This place would be a great part of a night out combined with a stroll along the river walk which is just outside the restaurant."

Maybe it was the switch from peanuts to popcorn in the early &#39;80&#39;s that started it, I don&#39;t know but they used to have such great service and such good food.  Now, it seems no different than any other chain that you could find on the outer perimeter of any mall, in any city, in any state.

Gone are the matronly waitresses that called you &#34;honey&#34; and &#34;sweetie&#34;, in with the dude greeting two women with &#34;hey guys, what are ya drinking?&#34;.  Ugh.  The pizza isn&#39;t the same either.  Now its tasting like prefabbed canned sauce, low moisture skim mozz on cardboard with mass produced, flavorless pepperoni and sausage.  Its not horrible, but it used to be a lot better.

Points for the outdoor patio across the street from the swollen, rolling Fox River, ample free parking and dark corners to hide in.  Warm fireplace in the winter and ass kicking rum barrels.  Oh and they have steak fries!  Yum."

Service was fine, food was mediocre. Cream of asparagus soup (of the day) tasted like flour and milk with a few pieces of rogue asparagus floating around in it. French onion soup was slightly better but pretty salty. Atmosphere is cozy but the food isn&#39;t worth going back for."

You can always get a predictable meal at the Squire.  It is by no means the best food around, but not a bad meal either.  Cocktails are excellent if Mary is tending bar.  Service is excellent if Sandi is the server.  Other servers are spotty.  You can either draw a good one, or you can end up with one of the worst.  Most of the food items are good.  Occasionally the kitchen is a bit spotty as well.  Sometimes steaks are overcooked.  

They offer live entertainment each night.  Some nights are better than others.  

All in all, its a great place to go to relax in the rustic atmosphere, have a few cocktails, a couple bowls of popcorn and a decent meal."

I enjoy the rustic/comfortable atmosphere of this place. It&#39;s a classic establishment that I hope lasts forever. The live music and free popcorn seals the deal for me.

My lovely girlfriend Robin and I started off with some Mai Tais and Saganaki! Saganaki is really tasty flaming goat cheese! I highly recommend you eat it! 

We ordered a pepperoni pizza. The cheese here is actual cheese. Not the BS fake plastic-like cheese that you will get at other places. Most pizza places (ie.pizza hut, papa johns) nowadays use REAL brandname cheese which is actually not &#39;real&#39; cheese. So I&#39;ve always loved their pizza. And you can&#39;t beat the half-price pizza after 3pm on Mondays!

All in all we had a very nice time. Our server was wonderful, the Mai Tais were very tasty and the live piano accompaniment  was beautiful."

Having gone here over the years, the fact that simple things (like free popcorn, live music, a warm fireplace and friendly bar keep greeting you when you walk in the door) still remain are the reason we make The Squire a must stop whenever we are in the area.  Whether for drinks after a night out, or as a meeting place for long time friends, the food, service and ambiance never fail to hit the mark.  The Squire is a staple and in this economy it&#39;s great to see it still thriving and building memories for us."

Great Martinis and the Mai Thais are simply the best.  Love the all you can eat fried chicken on Sundays.  This is not gourmet cooking by any means but the food is always good and you will never break the bank going here.

Portions are a little large for lunch (at least for me) but they never mind you splitting with someone else. It&#39;s probably the nicest beer garden in the western suburbs -- and the view of the river can&#39;t be beat.

I Wish I could give a 2.5 star review. I felt like I was walking into a castle or something. It was a fun change up from the norm. The person who sat us and our waitress were very pleasant. The food comes in large quantities but lacks in actual taste. We got a HUGE portion of potato skins. Those are pretty standard. My husband got the chicken alfredo and I&#39;m telling you, it really tasted like nothing. I actually really liked my fish sandwich, it was huge but tasted as expected. They have some good drink specials. I got one of their rum runners and I liked it but was pretty sweet and I couldn&#39;t taste much alcohol in it. I think I would recommend this place if you wanted to go somewhere to grab some drinks with your significant other or friends and get some run of the mill, greasy and bland bar food. And hey - sometimes that&#39;s what you want."

I had the veggie wrap which was pretty good; my husband had a chicken melt which was OK.
