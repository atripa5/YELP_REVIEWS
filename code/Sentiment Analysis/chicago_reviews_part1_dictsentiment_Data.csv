home-bistro-chicago,David G.,0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,kVh-UkDt0XBuAoinhVRnOQ,"A friend of mine told me that if I only visit one restaurant in the ambiguously named Boystown/Northalsted/Lakeview vicinity, it needed to be HB (Home Bistro).  So off I went, on a cold and rainy Wednesday evening.It might&#39;ve been dismal outside, but the interior of HB is warm, cozy, and very inviting.  Lots of earthtones and oranges, mirrors, and candles whisk you off to a romantic villa somewhere on the Mediterranean coast.  Once I was seated, HB felt like a perfect refuge.I lucked out by showing up on a Wednesday, since that&#39;s their prix fixe night -- $33 for 3 courses.  That&#39;s a killer deal for high-end cuisine in a high-rent district.I started dinner with some hot tea -- perfect for keeping those Midwestern chills at bay.  (HB is a BYOB, so no booze on the menu -- sorry alchies!)Course #1 was baby beet salad with honey ricotta, hazelnut streusel, and arugula.  I normally love beet-anything, but I didn&#39;t enjoy this salad at all.  The beets were totally undercooked (mostly raw in the middle), and all that raw earthiness clashed badly with the overly-sweet honey ricotta and streusel.Course #2 was much better: pan-roasted Atlantic salmon with couscous, cucumber ralta, and strawberries.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the cool raita and sweet strawberries contrasted well with the fish.The real highlight was Course #3 (dessert) -- bread pudding.  I get the impression that this is the specialty of the house, and for good reason.  It&#39;s moist and light and crazy flavorful, without overdoing it on the sweetness.  It&#39;s probably the best bread pudding I&#39;ve ever had.Service was very gracious and friendly.  Even though I was dining solo that night, the hostess and server made me feel like part of the family.All in all, even though the food was inconsistent, there&#39;s still lots to like about HB.",231,4,2,5,50,5.8223,4.162,1.425,15.414000000000001,No
home-bistro-chicago,Tina L.,i_jyzR3NhOldcHa2K1UqtQ,L4cPxRvaZkajuUfTjEEfNA,"This is such a quaint little restaurant tucked away in Boystown. It&#39;s BYOB so make sure to bring a couple bottles to enjoy with your meal!I decided to come here for my boo&#39;s birthday dinner. Based on the reviews and the fact that it was BYOB, I thought it would totally be worth a try. Even though it was a Tuesday night and there weren&#39;t many people in the restaurant (4 tables including our party), it took a while for the food to come out. Other than that, the service was very attentive and I can tell that they take pride in the dishes they come out with.We ordered two of the specials that day, which was a pork tacos (definitely had a kick to it, so if you can&#39;t take spicy, beware!) and the pork loins with creamed corn. We also ordered the mussels, which were on the main menu. We both loved the pork tacos the best, mostly b/c of the spicy kick that it had along with the complementary flavors of the kimchi and Thai mango salsa. The mussels were pretty decent, not like the most amazing mussels I&#39;ve had. By the time the pork loin dish came out, we were getting pretty full, so we actually only had a few bites of it and took the rest home.Since it was my boo&#39;s bday, of course we got some dessert. They brought it out with a little lighted candle so that he could make a wish. What&#39;d you wish for, honey? Your wish already came true when you met me!

home-bistro-chicago,Sarah S.,QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q,uxxx7ubH_TN0Mu942sZiIw,"Step into Home Bistro (HB) and you&#39;ll be met by a friendly hostess and warm dining area. It&#39;s not big at all and expect to be pretty cozy to your dining party and those around you, as well. I love BYOB places and HB is one of them. Bonus points because they let us crack our bottles while waiting, even bringing out glasses. Once seated at our table, they provided buckets of ice to put our bottles in - a much appreciated gesture.Service is spotty. We would go long periods of time without seeing our server and it always seemed to be when we needed something. Food also took quite a long time to come out. It was a Friday night and very busy so I understand but just a heads up not to expect a quick dining experience here.When the food came out, all thoughts of an upcoming mediocre experience dissipated as my hunger pains were satiated by deliciousness. I had the Berkshire Pork Belly for $23. The pork belly sat atop a bed of german potato salad, house bacon, rhubarb butter, and marinated lacinato kale. The elements of the dish married well together and all melted in my mouth. It was a truly delicious dinner that I&#39;d highly recommend.Food is amazing at HB and I would love to go back to try more. It&#39;s a cute restaurant but gets very crowded and noise levels are through the roof with hit or miss service. All in all, a great place for dinner with friends having conversations &amp; catch-ups with your BYOBs but may not be right for a date night.",173,4,2,5,19,5.407200000000001,2.8160000000000003,0.278,13.905000000000001,No

This place lived up to the hype in a city full of overhyped restaurants and bars.   Small little place and definitely a little loud, but that&#39;s all worth the amazing food.  We started with the handmade pretzels and the beer cheese.  Omg, the pretzels were so warm and soft, and the beer cheese was absolutely perfect.  The consistency was so soft and creamy it was almost like a mustard.We each had the specials tonight.  I had the gnocchi with pork belly, and a sort of relish sauce of garlic and other delightful ingredients that I can&#39;t recall because I was equally enjoying the fact that HB is BYOB. (no corkage fee).  My gf had the pork loin on a bed of polenta and spinach.  Also amazing.  Finally despite being stuffed we could not pass on the bread pudding.  It was good, although not the best I&#39;ve ever had.  But between the starters, entrees, and great service this place is 5 stars easy.  Oh and the portion sizes were made for humans and not mice.

That&#39;s when I sat down and read the menu, and found this in the appetizer section:&#34;Beer-Battered Asparagus&#34;Home Bistro does comfort food right, and the asparagus was no exception.  First, the damn things were huge--and they were mounted on one side of a large plate with a dipping sauce that was basically mayo and horseradish and a big egg that you broke to mix in with the other sauce.  This worked well.  The rainbow trout was my selection of an entr’©e and that also worked to perfection, although I would admit &#34;perfection&#34; included salted flesh, near-perfect potatoes and pickled red cabbage, which isn&#39;t something I look for typically.  My wife grabbed the mussels, mainly because she ALWAYS gets mussels if they are on the menu...the gobbling sounds of delight from across the table told me all I needed to know there, although the fries were not much better than McDonald&#39;s with an aioli that wasn&#39;t memorable.  (Of course, we downed all of the fries and nearly all of the aioli anyway...but, still.)With tax and tip, we got out of this for $62.  How was that possible, with all of the entrees prices in the $20-and-up category?  BYO, my friends.  If you are gonna give me high-end food and the chance to bring my own wine, you and I will become very close, very quickly, so I have to give HB credit for making date night for the two of us so very worth it.A La Card steered me here so we got $10 off of our meal...grab that deck if you haven&#39;t already!",180,5,2,3,21,2.0663,1.6349999999999998,0.252,10.113,No

It was for sure right up there with some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. From the moment we walked in and were greeted by the lovely smiling hostess, I was feeling this place. We had made a reso and arrived before our other friends, but they went ahead and seated us which we appreciated. We had brought two bottles of bubbly and opened one right away....why hold off the celebration?? Our server, Dionne, casually floated by, took the one bottle to keep cold and brought us an ice bucket for the open bottle. More to come about this amazing &#34;floating Dionne&#34; to come....Our friends arrived, with another 2 bottles of wine. We don&#39;t play. Anyway, Dionne came right over and took care of them as well...opened their one bottle and poured a couple of glasses for them. She then floated off to give us time to chit chat and settle in. In a few minutes, she returned, sat down next to me on the bench and proceeded to share the specials. We loved that Dionne felt comfortable enough to cozy up to us in this way. We are a pretty open and fun group, so it felt completely natural to have her on our level and just being real and down to earth in the moment.So for starters we had the fried oysters, patatas bravas and the artichoke appetizer. Where do I begin??? The detailed preparation, mix of fresh flavors and presentation were beyond impressive! I can&#39;t even begin to explain the explosion of savory delight that occurred upon each and every bite of literally every dish. Unbelievable! I&#39;m so serious!For entrees the two guys got the buttermilk fried smoke chicken sandwich, with slaw and pickles. Ridiculous.....ohhhhheeemmmmmgggeeeeee they were like, &#34;this is the best sandwich I&#39;ve ever eaten!&#34; And, for certain it was. The sandwich came with truffle fries. Now, I&#39;m obsessed with truffle fries and these were hands down THE BEST truffles fries that have touched this mouth. Hubs was like, these fries are kinda white looking, so Dionne told him to try one to make sure they were done. He tried one and was floored with delight. They were perfect. So, get this, as we were going hard on our food and having great conversation, Dionne &#34;floated&#34; by again, slid between our friends and swiped a fry off my husbands plate! Lol it happened so fast and we were all like, did that just happen?!? We totally lost our shit and were laughing hysterically as Dionne stood back and winked! She became my hero at that moment. I realize a server can&#39;t get away with that kinda stunt with most people, but that she could read our vibe and have fun with us, made the experience one of my favorites ever!I got the soft shell crab special....deliciousness. I&#39;m an east coast girl originally so I could def appreciate this wonderful dish. My gf had the vegetarian dish with spatzel and cheese. It was also a delight. Dessert was next. Oh my oh my. We couldn&#39;t decide on one to share so we got all three. The panda cotta with lemon zest, pepper and salt. Sounds weird but was our fave. The bread pudding was incredible and the dark chocolate with walnuts and dried fruit was spectacular. We will def be back...and often!!",387,5,3,5,68,16.502,9.878999999999998,1.553,32.568,No

While this dish still has growing to do, it was a surprisingly innovative dish with tremendous potential. Outstanding!!! I encourage the chef to take this just a little further...it will be his signature dish.PANNACOTTA was even better. Very interesting in a yummy way. I heard the server say cardamom, but it was more elusive than that, in my opinion. The flavor was too hard to narrow down other than &#39;spice&#39;. One of the most innovative - yet simple - desserts I&#39;ve had in a long time. Bravo.Note to restaurant (on the chance they read this): 5 year loyal customer, but visits are less frequent over time. Stopped to analyze it (over dinner with my guest) and decided it was because the menu is too slow to evolve. I can pretty much guess the menu before I walk in. Evolve, please.

This was a major let down, because I searched through Yelp for about an hour before finally selecting this place.  The only positive was we were seated immediately despite it being pretty packed.  I love bacon wrapped dates and order whenever I find them on a menu.  Big mistake.. The dates were incredibly sweet in the worst way, not to mention topped with brown sugar.  I also ordered the short rib corn dogs.  Mistake number two..  I&#39;m confident any freezer brand corn dogs would hold its own against these in a blind taste test.  They weren&#39;t terrible, but not distinguishable difference a standard corndog.$25 into my meal and I was already experiencing buyer remorse, but I stayed the course in hopes of better entrees.  But wait.. Our server hadn&#39;t been to our table in quite some time, so our entr’©e orders weren&#39;t taken.  I found this to be odd because every other table I observed impeccable service and attentiveness.  No explanation, but true.  Rarely have I visited a restaurant where they allow water glasses to get empty, let alone sit empty for over 15 mins.While waiting for our server to take our entr’©e order the busser noticed we weren&#39;t eating our apps &amp; offered to take them away.  He also filled our water.  When our server returned, I reminded her to take our entr’©e order.  We opted for the trout and the short rib tacos.  After another long wait and no water, we finally received our food.  The tacos came with a side of refried beans, which were cold.  The corn tortillas were straight from the package. Not warmed.  The trout was overcooked and tepid.  My guess is our plates sat in the back for a while better coming out.  We picked at both dishes, but left 90% on both plates.  When our server found time to ask, I let her know we were disappointed and explained the misfires with each dish.  She offered no response.  No offer to remake or order a different dish..No offer to remove items from the bill.. No offer to notify the owner, who was onsite.  My friend&#39;s company hosted an event in the past and recognized him as he stopped by several tables, not ours.  I requested the bill, paid in full (third mistake), left the food and went across the street to Wood.

Dolled up, and with a few bottles of wine tucked into a grocery bag, we strolled into the unassuming door located on the west-side of Halsted Street. A cozy, quaint room that appeared to be lit by candle light appeared before us.We were seated within minutes and began analyzing the menu. Everything was tempting! Unfortunately they had already sold-out of the braised pork. This was not a game-changer for me as I had my eye on the seafood special.We ordered 3 appetizers to pass around the table. They were pretty small, barely a bite per person. The beet salad was my favorite, BUT everything was awesome.As soon as the appetizers were complete, the main course came rolling out- and mine was by far the most spectacular! There were TONS of muscles, some clams, and three large shrimp tucked away in this heaping bowl of amazing-ness.Garnish atop was some pickled-like apples and some other greens. I was skeptical about how they would play into a sea food dish...BUT they complimented it to a &#39;tee.&#39; The broth was superb and once I was done with all the seafood and had all the shells stacked in a separate bowl, I discovered there was still more! There were these braised, short-rib maybe? nuggets of scrumptious meat underneath all the broth.I tried some of the others&#39; food. The Amsterdam Muscles had a strong anise flavor incorporated into it.  I think that flavor stood out more to me as it was a sharp contrast to the muscles I just digested. I helped finish whatever muscles they could not.The gnocchi with meatballs had almost a dessert-like essence and had an infusion of cinnamon to go with. Also a fantastic choice.We had dessert...

I chose HB because I heard many good things about it. First of all, I was a little skeptical because I didn&#39;t want my family to be disappointed but we ended up having a great time.The atmosphere was perfect for us, as the background music was cheerful and not very loud so that we could easily hold a conversation. The waiters were very polite and described the menu with patience so we never regretted what we ordered. When the food came we were surprised by the huge portions but everything was so delicious that we left nothing in our plates. I personally loved the seafood stew which was way better than what I had eaten in other restaurants. I also liked that although we stayed a lot of time laughing and talking, no one kicked us out after we finished eating.

home-bistro-chicago,Nicole H.,UDkoCw_JCLK-mqEYgvzl8A,HW2jOYpatYbkm4PnVec8Gg,"So, this BYOB place is right on trend.  For an appetizer, I choose the fried oysters. My fiance failed to hold my attention b/c I was in food heaven bite after bite. Fried Oysters are tricky, and this place nailed it.  For dinner, we both opted for the pork shoulder. I have never had this dish before. It was a huge portion (although delicious) and I did end up taking the rest home.Of course, I could not resist exploring the dessert menu. I excitingly ordered the cream bule. It came in a deep dish with 7 creamy layers.The crispy caramelized top was perfection. As I reached the bottom, my taste buds were presently surprised with a pallet change of spicy dark chocolate and a hint of lime. Needless to say there was nothing left!  I would have taken a picture but my phone was unable to capture it in the lighting. ( I am a huge fan of food porn. )Reservations are a must, the place is not very large.

home-bistro-chicago,N H.,xDVjNobWSH_P4qGql0GmZg,39QKUqr9Z7pLMAwBePCC9g,"Having read up on HB, I gave this as an option to my husband for planning our anniversary dinner. We are both happy he chose it. I do not typically like short menus....this girl likes options. However, someone in an earlier review mentioned preferring a few dishes to choose from because you know they are taking care of each dish, as opposed to mass producing for 40 different options. YES!!! That is exactly what you get out of Home Bistro.  For you foodies out there (or those of you striving to be, like me), you need to come here. Do your homework and check out the menu online, periodically - they do change things up. It is a small, intimate setting. We were the first reservation of the evening (Thursday), but within half an hour, most of the tables were taken. I loved the vibe....the young hipster crowd, Gen Xers like us, people my parents&#39; age....everyone brought their bottles, cracked them open, and took in the experience.  My husband had never had escargot, and he was willing to try the appetizer. It had us at hello...escargot, sauteed garlic with roasted tomatoes...the garlic clove just melted - at first, I was put off by a whole clove, but it is obvious it was cooked in the buttery sauce, and it was not garlicky...just ridiculously delicious! When they first served it I was like where&#39;s the bread - not necessary! They could probably use a couple of more croutons to help soak up the sauce, but we made sure we did not leave a speck in the bowl.  We then ordered the endive salad...the flavors were subtle...almost a bit too subtle because it was more dry than I would&#39;ve preferred - just a tad more of the walnut dressing would&#39;ve knocked it out of the park. Then, my husband ordered the Bulgogi Steak w/truffle fries...it was surprisingly served as a sandwich, NOT what we expected but SO happy with it. My husband asked for ketchup, and I thought the owner (who was helping serve our table) was going to have a grabber by the look on his face, but we didn&#39;t see that they had placed the cup with the truffle mayo on the table...oh man, probably the best truffle ANYTHING I&#39;ve ever had - you have to be so careful with adding Truffle Oil to anything because it can be overpowering but this was subtlety at it&#39;s finest!  I had one of the evening&#39;s specials, homemade pappardelle in a cherry pepper arrabiatta sauce...how can sauce first taste too sweet, then too spicy, then just blend together to be so absolutely right?! So good! I&#39;m not a huge fan of paying $25 for a bowl of pasta (or for a sandwich, which is why I took a star away - the food is a bit overpriced), especially one that doesn&#39;t include some sort of meat or fish, but I loved it! My husband and I both agreed it was close to as perfectly al dente as you are going to get. At first, we thought the portions of our meals looked small, as some previous reviewers mentioned, but we took a lot of time with each course, tasting and observing what was on the plate, so it made it a truly enjoyable experience for our palets.And, it is what I love about this place - unique flavors you really won&#39;t have anywhere else. It&#39;s exactly the type of dining experience my husband and I prefer - something that is not cookie-cutter and has its own personality....GREAT EXPERIENCE! The owner overheard us toasting our anniversary, and brought dessert on the house....after The Ketchup Incident, we were pleasantly surprised. We had ordered the Ras el Hanout Panna Cotta. He recommended it, as it is homemade, and he said it would pair nicely with our bubbly. I don&#39;t even know how to describe the flavors....I tasted basil, lime, a sweetness I couldn&#39;t identify (thanks byob,  by then i was a wee bit sauced). WHATEVER it was, it was so delicious, refreshing and indulgent at the same time.Not Alinea-level fine dining obviously, but a pleasurable, down-to-earth, unique experience.",444,4,2,5,46,12.250100000000003,5.760000000000001,0.43200000000000005,24.806999999999995,No

(Display window) If your going to use that as a draw. Then you need to wash the windows. As I sat and watched the peeling paint on the walls, (Literally) I was expecting dinner to be an outstanding follow up to the brunch we had here. Right! It was 46 degrees outside and 60 inside. I went to wash my hands in the only washroom they had it was a mess. Cracked sink, I stepped on the toilet paper as I tried to close the door as it was so tight. I felt like I walked into the alley. And yes. It was even colder in the loo. Our server told us about the braised beef rib corn dogs. They came with a sweet chutney sauce. Delicious! I felt the need for some greens, so we ordered the Caesar. I love cheese. But the first fork full completely dried out my mouth. The cheese covered everything and was thicker on the bottom. It absorbed all the dressing. That really didn&#39;t seem like there was too much of to begin with. I had to take a drink with every bite. And the 4 white bread croutons were a joke! Ordering the meatloaf special, I thought was a safe bet. It was a salt lick on a plate. I could feel my heart racing with every bite. The kale that was severed with it, was marinated in vinegar which I love. But again. Too much of a good thing. As I brought the fork up to my mouth, the vinegar took my breath away as it was so strong. The service was great.

Okay, weird, I thought. Little did I realize it served as a harbinger of the evening&#39;s theme.   For a plethora of reasons, I really wanted to like the BYOB.  The chef runs the place with presumed pride, personally presenting a quasi-fresh bruschetta almost immediately.  He charmed me and my dinner companion in Old World style, introducing himself personally before excusing himself to go back into the kitchen.  The menu offered a variety of dishes representing selections from land and sea. With an almost cinematic quality, strands of overhead patio lights reflected off of the wine glasses like miniature strings of pearls.  He seemed to get it half right. The mussels in pesto/cr’åme peeked out of perfectly prepared sauce, but the mussels mysteriously disintegrated somewhere along the way and never reached our plates. Our forks fecklessly stabbed the shells, only to find remnants of cartilage that hadn&#39;t boiled away.   No complaints about the beet/goat cheese salad.  Mediocre and heavily drizzled in olive oil. I suspected it was to camouflage the canned vegetables.   Our entr’©e, a slightly overcooked Mahi-Mahi arrived two hours after we ordered it.  Even though we arrived ahead of the dinner crowd, we were one of the last to be served.      Just as we toasted summer&#39;s swan song weekend, my friend dropped a dessert fork into a half-eaten chocolate souffl’©.  What is it, I asked?  With pursed lips and a napkin that looked poised to thwart vomit, she shook her head.  I turned around to meet the focal point of her gaze, only to see a rat traversing the cobblestones in a fully lighted area toward the table next to us. It showed no fear or hesitation as we shouted and clapped our hands.  Instead, it skittered to the opposite side of the patio, eliciting a chorus of shrieking before returning to our side.     When we rushed inside to quickly pay our bill and let them know why we were in such a hurry to leave, our waitress nodded her head.  &#34;I know, that&#39;s why I haven&#39;t been using the back door to check on tables.  I&#39;m scared to go outside.&#34;     Another restaurant employee nodded in assent. &#34;They come from outside.&#34;     So is it fair to ding a small business with this review?

A lot of the other people had the tagliata alla toscana, I did try it, but was flavorless.

Great flavor and seafood was good perfect, not chewy. My friends got the bolognese and thought it was good, but wanted more of the ragu.

I was escorted down to a private room area that had tons of space. Don&#39;t let ukie village square footage fool you. This place has tons of room. I felt like I was dining at at my mom&#39;s house with the coral colored walls and rustic art.

Btw, it&#39;s only beer, champagne and wine allowed. Save the shots for after. Server even took the obnoxious group photos without complaining. He was on point. Within 2 min of seating, he brought out tons of complimentary bruschetta and mini garlic bread. Definitely a plus before a night of heavy drinking. I highly recommend sharing an entree with your boo or friend because with all the free carbs and your booze, you won&#39;t have much room for more. My section of the table had the seafood risotto, spinach stuffed tortelloni and tagliatelle. Risotto was creamy and yummy. Our tortelloni was perfection. Why 4 stars? There&#39;s a $4 corkage fee which is stated in the menu. People need to make their $, understood. The problem was that I told my server I brought 2 bottles, but it seems like the other people forgot to claim theirs. Instead of asking, the server just split all the bottle fees evenly, even if 1 person brought 3 bottles and someone else brought 0.

Went here a week ago as a well deserved night out with my husband before we welcome baby #2. Appetizers were OKAY (ricotta dumplings and caesar salad). Service rated a B. Dinner was two entrees: the pappardelle (mediocre at best and could have been MUCH more creative) but the chicken dish with mushroom sauce was delicious. Dessert and cappuccino were also tasty. We left satisfied and happy. Being 30 weeks pregnant, I have been craving the chicken dish. Ordered via Door Dash on Tuesday when I was home alone and the driver went there and no one was at the restaurant despite the website saying it was open. Called again tonight as my hubby is out and I am home alone with our toddler unable to leave the house and the order gets cancelled. I call the restaurant to understand why. Some girl answers and says that the owner says he never received an order from Door Dash. Fine, okay. I ask what I should do to which the owner tells her to tell me he is working with a vendor but doesn&#39;t know who and is too busy to help me right now. Wait, what?? He is the OWNER and does not know what vendor he is working with? Umm, ok. When i ask her what to do as now I am without food that I ordered over an hour ago, she says place an order with them. I ask, &#34;can you find out what vendor I can have deliver,&#34; and confusingly she replies it will have to be takeout. I remind her AGAIN that I cannot pick it up. She asks, &#34;Well, what do you want me to do?&#34; My response was ask your owner to run his business properly and mention that it is a shame the he does not care to lose a customer&#39;s business. I then say that I will just figure it out as I did not want to inconvenience the girl that answered the phone with my problem. She said, &#34;OK.&#34; we both hung up. Thanks for taking care of me, Briciola, and for caring. I appreciate your lack of concern for my being disgruntled. I also appreciate that you managed to help me unintentionally save $30 because now I can enjoy my $3 in chips and ramen that are siting in the cabinet and not spend money on food tonight.

But pretty soon the patio filled up so I&#39;d really suggest making reservations if you&#39;ve got your heart set on dining al fresco. I love my gal group because we&#39;re not shy on sharing plates. So I got to try 3 other main dishes other than my own and let me tell you there was not one bad meal in the bunch. We were started with the complimentary bruschetta, and we ordered the fried calamari and roasted baby artichokes. All very good starters.  Well made but if I had to make the choice again, I&#39;d just go with the calamari. For our main dishes, I ordered one of the specials--a house made rigatoni pasta with shrimp in a wine sauce. It does seem pretty basic but the rigatoni made the dish--the pasta was perfect. I got to try the Chitarra (square pasta with a spicy tomato sauce, shrimp and mussels) and the other 2 specials--Cheese ravioli in a brown butter sauce with fried sage and the risotto of the day with rabbit and balsamic sauce. All three were just amazing.  I am usually not a fan of ravioli but this was best I have ever had--the cheese was so well blended and creamy.  The rabbit in the risotto was not gamey but very tender. The Chitarra sauce and pasta was very flavorful too.  Service was nice, friendly and helpful. I wish they provided a wine cooler for our whites.

My husband and I finally had a chance to check it out, and were especially excited about the idea of being able to sit outside on a perfect summer day to enjoy a meal.We were a little worried because we did not make reservations, but when we arrived, there was plenty of seating, including a number of open tables in the patio. Unfortunately, when we asked for a seat on the patio, we were advised that nothing was open. That was a little odd considering we saw several tables open, but figured that they were likely reserved. To jump ahead of myself, when we left, there were still tables open.They started our meal off with a bruschetta small plate which was pretty good. My husband ordered the rib eye steak, and I ordered the tagliatelle with bolognese sauce. We were surprised when the food arrived as it was quicker than expected for a sit-down Italian restaurant (no more than 5 to 8 minutes). Unfortunately, the quality of the food was something to be desired. The first thought when we saw the steak was that it looked quite odd. It was grayish in color (vs brown like most other steaks). On top of that, it was sitting a bath of olive oil. The quality of the steak was also extremely disappointing. There were parts that were chewy and almost inedible. The part that hurt the most was that dish was the most expensive plate on the menu.The tagliatelle pasta itself was quite good, but the bolognese sauce tasted slightly like spaghetti-o sauce. Needless to say, despite the wonderful atmosphere, I am not sure we will be returning.",177,2,1,2,-17,1.0300999999999998,1.755,1.391,14.854999999999999,No

We started with the carciofi arrostiti. The artichokes were drizzled with a unique, but tasty green herb sauce and coupled with roasted chunks of garlic- yum! The spinacino ecologico = pine nuts + pancetta + goat cheese, so really there was no way that wasn&#39;t going to taste delicious. We opted for pasta as the main course since it&#39;s all handmade by the Italian chef. The gnocchi with bolognese sauce did not disappoint. After a bottle of wine and an Italian feast, we didn&#39;t have room to test out the dessert. That just means we need to go back!

My date had been here many times and could not believe how awful the experience was.  The bread basket we received was tough and dry and was not served with olive oil to provide some moisture until we specially requested it.  We ordered the salmon as well as the pasta special with jumbo shrimp.  The pasta dish was fine, but it only came with 2 shrimp and was a little bland and needed a more robust sauce.  The salmon was a disaster.  We cut it in half to share it, and we saw that it was completely uncooked.  We touched the inside and it was ice cold!!  When we informed our server, he did not apologize, but he did take it back to have another one made.  When it came back, we cut it in half again, and it was still undercooked and raw in the middle!  We informed our server, who again did not apologize, and at that point we said we&#39;d just pass on the salmon.  Our server then asked us if we wanted dessert, but we just took the check.We couldn&#39;t believe that we were offered no apology, no attempt at a make-good (free dessert?), and that the food was just so, so disappointing.  We didn&#39;t have to pay for the salmon of course, but we were charged full price for the pasta with 2 shrimp ($22) and were also charged a $4 wine service fee (that was a screw-top we opened ourselves).The patio is really lovely; it&#39;s just a shame that the food and service don&#39;t match the ambiance.",158,1,1,-1,-21,-1.5727,1.063,2.091,12.846,No

Plus the inside was empty.. (later saw that a few people were outside.. but it was a tad cold for us to take advantage of their wonderfully spacious patio.)  So first of all, I must say that it was odd that in an almost entirely empty room, they opted to seat us next to a large party with a screaming kid... we probably should have asked for a different table on hindsight, but oh well.. live and learn. Now the food is another story.. excellent.  We started the night off with the appetizer special - Caramello - which was resembled a large fried candy that was filled with 3 kinds of mushrooms.  It was very delicious and a perfect start.  (This was something that the owner just made up .. not something you&#39;d find at other places.)As for the dinners, I got to taste 3 of them and all were good.. The Gnocchi with Bolognese sauce was very good and fresh.  The Mahi itself was fresh (this was the pesce special of the day) but I am not a fan of mixing with a tomato base personally.  My dish was the Petto Di Pollo Alla Checca which was pan fried (breaded) and had capers, tomatoe and basil as well as just the right amount of mozzarella cheese.  Loved it as well as the Strascinati side I had, which resembles spinach but is actually broccoli sauteed with Olive Oil and Garlic.We were celebrating a birthday so we had one of the best and freshest pieces of Tiramisu I can recall.  Service was great and our server was extremely knowledgable about the dishes and recommendations.

Last night was so bad, that I will not be back. Everyone goes to Briciola for the lovely patio, BYOB and great Italian food....We show up (reservation for 6 people for my friends birthday), and our table has colony of ants underneath it. I&#39;m not talking about a few ants here and there, I understand we are sitting outside and there will be bugs, but AN ARMY OF ANTS. They were crawling up one of the chairs. We asked if we could move tables, and we were told, &#34;Well then no one is going to want to sit there.&#34; (so we are supposed to??). Then I asked if they had anything they could kill the ants with, and you would think I just asked them to give me their first born child, the server looked at me with shock and said, &#34;I don&#39;t kill anything that is part of the ecosystem, so if you want them gone, someone else will have to kill them&#34;, and then he stormed off. Another server came to ask us if anything was wrong, and we explained the situation and told her we would like to move inside because of the ant situation. At that point, the manager (?) came and sprayed down the ants with something....ok, fine, thank you, problem solved.The rest of the night, we barely saw our server, our water was never re-filled, the server from before literally threw our Caprese Salad onto the middle of our table (probably because he was super upset we ruined the ecosystem), and at the end of the night, our server literally just dropped off our credit cards without so much as a word. She also added 20% gratuity. I used to be a server, and even if the patrons were the worst people in the world, I would still say &#34;thank you&#34;. Nothing. Not. A.

I am always on the hunt for good BYOB.  Aside from the huge plus of the BYOB ($3-4 corking fee), they also had solid Italian food.  Of course, because it is BYOB, it can be crowded so I recommend reservations.  The (free) brushetta when you arrive is a nice touch.  For appetizers, we split the mussels in a pesto sauce and the Tuna Carpacci. I preferred the mussels. The broth was amazing and I just wish there was more bread to dip in its deliciousness.  The tuna was okay, but lacked a wow flavor.  I would probably skip that dish the next time and try something else. Although the menu is not inordinately large, I had a hard time picking between items on the menu and the specials.   I ordered the Chitarra which is a spicy seafood pasta.  It had shrimp, calamari and clams.  It was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  The rest of the table seemed pleased with their meals as the talking subsided when the meals arrived.  I tried the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese which was delicious (note: it does not have the typical tomato base sauce that you might think of).  I tried the gnocchi which was cooked well, but I didn&#39;t really get why the dish was a special. Service was good.  Our waiter was patient in going over the specials and repeating them at least another time.  He also did not rush us out of the restaurant when we were finishing our bottles of wine after the meal.

It was great to relax on a gorgeous patio during a perfect summer night, after all of the ruckus.After contemplating the spicy seafood pasta entree, I ordered the pesto, sun-dried tomato gnocchi. The outer pieces were a bit too firm for my liking but most of inside pieces were tender and delicious after bathing in some of the best fresh pesto I&#39;ve had. The sweetness of the sun dried tomato really opened up the smooth and supple 89 point $9 Spanish red wine. We were lucky.My friend is also a recent vegetarian, but we agreed that such a transition should be done slowly so she opted for the special pasta of the day. The delicate, round discs of pasta were similar to ravioli, relaxing in a bed of creamy sauce and diced prosciutto. In the middle of writing this, i realize that no bread was brought to the table nor were we offered any. And where this would usually bother me a bit, that decision really allowed us to enjoy the purity of the dishes and was a better experience as a result.Oh so back to the ruckus part.So it all started once the sun was setting as I was on my sofa in a zombie state marathoning Breaking Bad. I was well under the impression that the night was over after waking up at 4 am, biking 45 miles at 6 am and then sipping bits of the same wine after pan roasting small shrimp in black pepper and olive oil to go with my leftover PIccolo Due mushroom black truffle risotto. It was already a pretty good day, as far as I was concerned.But my friend Dominga sent me a few Facebook messages saying that the Mad Decent Block Party was at capacity and don&#39;t bother trekking up there as they weren&#39;t letting people in. She was hungry and asked if I was up to hunting for some vittles. Another friend was hanging out at Small Bar to devour their tasty tots on the patio, but I wasn&#39;t sure I had any energy left to take transit up there.It was already after 7pm on a festive Saturday night, we were speeding up Halsted Street from Bridgeport contemplating where we could take a bottle of wine and still get in. After shooting down UIC area restaurants on Taylor Street, we sped over to Ruxbin but there was still a 2 hour wait. After cruising around on nearby, newly  half-paved streets, I used the trusty Yelp app to find Briciola with nearly 5 stars, stellar reviews and BYO! Called em up and the friendly young lady said we could come over but the patio was full. We were happy just to get in.Once we arrived, our hostess said hey we&#39;re gonna put you on the patio, something just opened up. The staff was very friendly, we met the guy who designed the elaborate patio lighting and chatted with the old school chef on the way out.Think we&#39;ve found a new local favorite!",314,4,2,5,40,8.469,4.44,0.5979999999999999,19.963,No

Perfect density and balance between the pesto, roasted peppers, goat cheese.  DELISH!  The breaded chicken special was to die for.  Despite it being fried, it didnt feel gross and heavy.  It had a lemony flavor and it was cooked perfectly.  The salmon was also FANTASTIC and the meat dishes were HUGE!  Totally worth the price.  Lastly, the tiramisu.  YUM!  It was done amazingly.  Light and airy with a hint of booze.  I cant wait to go again to try more of the pasta dishes...they all sounded so YUMMY!  Oh I forgot to mention...BYOB with no corkage fee.  For being BYOB, I thought the prices were totally reasonable. Some helpful tips:  The outdoor area has very uneven concrete...be careful in heels, especially after some wine :)  The seating out there is very close together so be prepared to stick your ass in someone&#39;s face when you are sitting down.  Go, see, eat, enjoy!

I&#39;m happy to report that service was attentive and friendly. Our server was knowledgeable on the menu and made solid recommendations.

The service - I had a friend visiting from out of town and, living only a few blocks away, this seemed like a great dinner option for some authentic Italian food and the BYOB option was a huge plus. I called ahead to ask if they took reservations and whoever answered the phone just told me that we could come in at 8:30. I asked if 8pm would be alright and she said it wouldn&#39;t be a problem. However, when we arrived and approached the hostess, she looked bewildered when I asked her for a table for two. She asked if I had made a reservation and I explained that I had tried but whoever answered the phone had just told me to come in, and that it would be fine. The hostess did not respond, and just turned around and looked at her book so I wasn&#39;t sure if she was just ignoring me or if she was going to seat us. When we finally got sat, we waited 10 minutes for someone to come to our table. In the meantime, a table that was seated after us was brought water, a basket of bread, and fresh bruschetta. When our waitress finally arrived, I had to request bread and we were never offered or brought bruschetta. The owner was also very attentive to every table but never visited ours. Finally, we were never made aware of the corkage fee for the BYOB, which was a fun surprise when we got the check. 2. The food - We ordered grilled octopus for appetizer, and there was absolutely no flavor and the octopus was not griller properly. It had the texture of a marshmallow and was entirely bland. The caesar salad was good. For the main course, we ordered the chicken roll that was stuffed with prosciutto, cheese, and spinach on top of mashed potatoes. The chicken was horribly dry, as was the prosciutto. However, the mashed potatoes were very good.

The kitchen is open so you can see all the hard work going into each and every dish as it&#39;s being made. Mario, the chef/owner oversees every detail of the food before it&#39;s delivered to the table.Complimentary bruschetta is brought out immediately and our waiter immediately uncorked our champagne and wine so we could start drinking while perusing the menu. The menu had several starters and salad options, as well as pastas and meat/fish entrees. A few daily specials were described to us and all four of us ended up ordering those as they sounded very appealing.I started with the soup of the day, which was a hearty pappa al pomodoro (Tuscan tomato and bread soup). It was rich and filling and a great start to the dinner. For my entr’©e, I had the porcini-crusted mahi mahi, served with a light garlic sauce over fresh spinach and tomatoes. I really enjoyed this dish and thought the porcini added a nice earthy flavor to the mild fish. The spinach was not cooked at all, and I would have preferred it to be lightly saut’©ed and this was barely wilted. All in all, I thought this was a delicious dish. Others at the table had a roasted lamb shank and squid-ink pasta with prawns and scallops in a saffron cream sauce. Everybody seemed pretty happy with their choices.Desserts were excellent as well. Our waiter informed us that they served the &#34;best tiramisu in Chicago&#34; (as voted by some magazine or website) so we ordered one of those as well as a panna cotta. I can never resist ordering panna cotta whenever it&#39;s offered.  Briciola&#39;s panna cotta was mixed-berry and it was so good that I had a hard time sharing it. Briciola is a terrific neighborhood spot. It&#39;s byob (a fact I wasn&#39;t aware of ahead of time so we had to make a run to the nearby liquor store) which always keeps the cost down. I believe it&#39;s a $3.00 corkage fee. My two minor quibbles were that it was very loud in here, as brick walls + tight space + lots of people = deafening. The other is that parking on this stretch of Damen Avenue is nearly impossible on a Saturday evening. We ended up parking about six blocks away,which is fine on a warm spring or summer evening, but not so much when it&#39;s freezing cold and you&#39;re wearing high heels.Our group was quite pleased with our meal and service and I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to come back again.",286,4,2,5,37,8.389800000000003,4.608,0.327,21.065,No

We sat outside and it was a romantic little nook of a patio. The issue was we were sat directly underneath the kitchen vent. It happened to be a humid night and it was very unappetizing because the smell and the heat were wafting our way. We were not greeted for about 10 minutes which was fine. The problem is after she brought us an ice bucket for our wine we had to wave the waitress down about 20 minutes later to place our order. The appetizers were decent. The gnocchi was good but the main courses were lackluster. I had the salmon which was overcooked, my date the halibut. It was one of those experiences that the minute you sit down you kick yourself for wasting date night on such a disappointing spot. I&#39;ve been on the fence about this place based on the reviews, an episode of check please sold me.

briciola-chicago,Andrew D.,MnTGt9FxfmU224BMrrsxwQ,tGdRp6pmOL8jsfS3QKgrBw,"Ventured a few blocks over to Briciola last week for my friend&#39;s birthday dinner. We had a group of 12 arriving at different times, so props to Briciola for accommodating all of us. Upon arrival, we were greeted with free bruschetta, which was fresh and tasty; nice touch. Unfortunately, the dining experience was just ok, not amazing, as I had come to expect with the press, write-ups, and good reviews this place generally receives. The deplorable 85 degree humidity did not help matters, as our group had to be seated outside and most of our group was soaked in sweat by the end of the meal. I wish the staff could have placed us inside at some point... The appetizers were great. The pesto mussels were the best and the fried calamari was above average. However, nothing I couldn&#39;t have at any other decent Italian restaurant for the same quality and price. My entree was also good - I had the chitarra, which was similar to a frutti di mare I&#39;d have elsewhere, but a bit more cream and spice in the sauce. Again, didn&#39;t blow my mind. I could probably have the same entree at one of the Rosebuds or Via Carducci and it would taste the same. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and finished it with ease. The troubling part about the food that takes away the fourth star is the slow service and the other entrees I tasted, which were NOT good. My friends who ordered the specials were disappointed. I don&#39;t remember what else was in the special ravioli, because the ginger dominated the dish and the brown gravy sauce was gross. My friend was too nice to return it to the kitchen; I would have - it was disgusting. Also, the ziti with squash and veal was a bit bland and not as tasty as I expected. Other star off goes for the corkage fee. I&#39;m sorry, but if you&#39;re going to be BYOB, you should not charge corkage. Plain and simple. Unless you already have a bar and you offer BYOB, it is a bit of a farfetched policy. I&#39;d recommend Briciola and I will probably return as it is a few blocks away from me, but it is far from spectacular and just decent.

Oh yeah, it has all the natural ingredients for a great experience - it&#39;s BYOB, it&#39;s home cooked Italian, it has some great selections and nightly chef specials. The atmosphere is quaint, if not a little crowded with tables a little too close together. But that&#39;s not what bothered me. Oh wait, it was the food!!! DUH!! It just wasn&#39;t what I had hoped for. Maybe I&#39;m spoiled since the last couple of Italian dinners in Chicago were at La Scarola and Caro Mio. This place doesn&#39;t even enter the discussion. Oh sure, if it were in my neighborhood and I could walk here, I&#39;d elevate my rating. But it&#39;s not. And, as a result, it&#39;s off my list for repeat performances.The complimentary bruschetta is a nice start. We followed with the polenta and Portobello appetizer which was delightful. Looking like a dessert, the polenta was well made and the mushroom with the balsamic glaze was very tasty. We also got the grilled calamari but they were a little tough and chewy and weren&#39;t a good choice nor were they conducive to sharing at a table of 4.We did try one of the chef specials, a black (squid ink) pasta dish with shrimp that was pretty good. I had the Chitarra Sciue Sciue which sounded like EXACTLY what I&#39;d love. Regrettably, the &#34;spicy&#34; tomato sauce was bland and uninspiring. The square noodles were perfectly cooked but the shrimp were small, the clams miniscule, and the calamari tough (recurring theme?). The best dish of the night was the Tagliatell Bolognese which I would order again. While the dinner wasn&#39;t memorable nor did it make me want to come back, it&#39;s not a bad choice when you&#39;re craving some home made Italian and a place to pop that cork on your Chianti Reserva.

joy-yee-noodle-chicago-2,Daniel B.,j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,rqK_a6D-d1jHTfC1lEQ3iA,"Joy Yee is a Pan-Asian restaurant that has a separate counter selling fresh fruit smoothies and bubble tea. It&#39;s located inside Chicago&#39;s Chinatown Square mall and the business is supposedly the first to sell bubble tea in the Midwest. On occasion, the shop will open up its windows and provide outdoor counter service.What sets this place apart from other Asian smoothie and tea shops is the abundance of fresh fruit that&#39;s chopped, sliced, and processed daily. Just look behind the counter to see bunches of raw, ripe fruit. I can&#39;t even begin to tell you all the mangoes I saw being peeled and cut. It made me want to get my mango smoothie right away.The drink menu is massive. They have over 40 smoothies (they call them &#34;freezes&#34; here) made from scratch with all sorts of fruit including Asian fruits like durian, jackfruit, and lychee. They start at $3.95 with boba $0.50 extra and jelly, popping boba, and pudding $0.70 extra. Mixed berry smoothies are $4.45 each.They have over 20 flavored teas (mostly green or black tea) and 25 milk teas starting at $3.55 each. In addition, they offer jelly drinks, fresh lemonade and fresh fruit Sprite drinks, mini pearl freezes with grass jelly, green tapioca freezes with fruit toppings, pudding and tapioca freezes, mini pearl freezes with fruit toppings, and coffee and chocolate beverages. In all, perhaps nearly 200 different drink options to choose from.All drinks are sized at 24 ounces.We went with a milk green tea with tapioca, mango freeze (smoothie), and honeydew freeze (smoothie) with tapioca. All three drinks tasted fresh and delicious. I thought the mango freeze was a tad sweet, but still, not bad. I&#39;m not sure if you can alter the sweetness on those. The tapioca were perfectly soft and appetizing and generally, all of the drinks were cool and refreshing.Service was quick. Unlike outside (Chinatown Square), the inside of the place feels relatively new and quite clean.I&#39;d definitely come back.",266,4,1,5,-40,5.307600000000001,3.1630000000000003,0.38,19.458000000000002,No

I love their Malaysian beef with green bean, and of course they have a huge assortment of milk teas and smoothies with many many add-ins, including boba. They have Durian smoothies! Joy Yee is the first restaurant I ate at when I was first introduced to Chinatown years back. With a friend from Chengdu, she thought Joy Yee would be a good starter for me, and although it has been years since then, and many restaurants have been deemed better - I still consider Joy Yee a favorite of mine. It is where husband and I take visitors from out of town whom are first timers to Chinatown, and I&#39;ve enjoyed passing on that introduction to others. The atmosphere is always buzzing and the tables always filled. During summer the walk-up window for smoothies and milk tea is massive.

Make sure to mix it so all the shaved ice at the top gets distributed and this becomes more like a smoothie texture.

Everything is family style. You are able to feed many people with one or two dishes. We ordered the Beef Spare Ribs, Pad Thai, and Orange Chicken. The Beef Spare Ribs were a bit fatty, but the flavor was different, and unique. We enjoyed the flavor, but the plethora or fat was a turn off. The Pad Thai was dry, and lacking flavor, which is unfortunate because I am a huge lover of Pad Thai. The Orange Chicken was good with the rice, and it came with broccoli on the side. For beverages we ordered bubble tea drinks: Thai iced tea, coconut milk, and mango. They were all very delicious.

I had just finished eating a four course brunch, macarons from a bakery, and additional carbs from a Chinatown bakery but something about the colorful menu consisting of 93024809328402 bubble tea options drew me in. It was pretty packed in the place but the host was able to get us seated pretty fast. And so my first experience with Joy Yee began...The size of the menu was literally huge. It was almost as large as the table top...I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before. The selection of bubble teas was also crazy extensive....who knew there could be so many flavor combinations?! There were hundreds of items on the menu to choose from ranging from beverages to fried rice dishes and salt and pepper anythings. I have to admit, it was a little overwhelming...but exciting at the same time? My table went with an avocado smoothie with fresh fruit, milk tea with mini pearls, pineapple tea with mini pearls, soft shell crab spring roll, lemongrass chicken wings, wonton noodle soup, and wontons in hot oil. I would have to say the soft shell crab spring roll and the lemongrass chicken wings were my favorites from what we had ordered. It&#39;s hard to go wrong with deep fried soft shell crab and sweet chili so that one by default was delicious. The lemon grass chicken wings were very flavorful, tasted like it was marinated in five spice and then fried with lemon grass - would have been even more delicious with some type of spicy dip. The actual beverages were OK - we wanted to go drinks we don&#39;t usually order in Minnesota...but maybe we should stick with what we know? They weren&#39;t bad, but not life changing in any way.The two items I liked least were the wontons in hot oil and the wonton noodle soup. The wontons in hot oil were bland as hell and honestly not even spicy? Maybe someone forgot to put some salt up in the oil...and the wonton noodle soup tasted like someone just boiled the wontons and decided to throw some veggies and chicken into the water used to boil the wontons.

Portions are big and delicious no matter what you get and is definitely worth the money (Most dishes are around 10 to 20 dollars). The food is HIGH QUALITY in my opinion, waiters and waitresses are nice it is a lovely experience.  I love it and I plan on going there again and again and again, it is just that good.HOWEVER delivery is another story.  I only had delivery once and to be honest I never plan to do it again.  The food quality has a HUGE difference. It is not bad, in fact it is just around the same quality as your normal neighborhood Chinese food delivery in my opinion but it pales in comparison to the actual restaurant experience. The food doesn&#39;t even taste like it&#39;s from the same place. And once again, its not that the delivery food is bad, it is just that the actual restaurant experience is so good it makes the delivery service look bad in comparison.So if you are looking to sit down and eat quality Asian style food than this is the perfect place for you.However if you just want normal Chinese food delivery this may not be it, since despite the lower quality in comparison to the sit in quality, most of the items are the same price so you might to better finding something cheaper?But literally if you want to sit in this is the best place to go.",150,4,1,5,0,5.947900000000001,2.868,0.427,11.706,No

A tall young chef then came up to the kitchen window overlooking the dining room, and angrily dead-eyed stared me, arms crossed, for several minutes. Never, in my restaurant-eating life, have I experienced intimidation from the kitchen for simply stating that the food took too long.We made multiple complaints to our server and to the manager, and no concern or effort was made to try and make things right.

the-duck-inn-chicago,Arthur M.,9rgiTp7kcoJ0cOY6uQDn4g,Iy4bXgus9vlpXWgWvyrncw,"I have lived right around the corner from the Duck Inn since I moved to Bridgeport.  I was already a fan of Chef Kevin from way back years ago when I went to the Four Seasons restaurant to try his fine dining dog (it was amazing.)  Later, I got a chance to work at a restaurant next to his in River North, and was always bringing the good vibes whether just saying hello or coming in for a big to-go order.Proof that I am one of the lazy ones: it took me almost half a year to walk through the hardscrabble to see the boathouse under construction at Park 571 on Eleanor Street (who am I kidding?! I drove.)  That same day my girlfriend and I actually did walk over from my place on Archer Avenue. I had read about the Duck Inn connection to Chef&#39;s family, and I was wicked excited to have my first meal there.All that being said, nothing prepared me for how awesome The Duck Inn actually is.  This is a badass team operating with passion across the board.  The space is beautiful, the bar room up front was The Gem Bar, and where we had dinner in back was the old operator&#39;s residence.  Terraced patio space, with tables on a couple different levels, tempted in the leafy backyard, but it was too hot that day.I asked our server the kind of dumbass question about the chefs&#39; counter seats that made me embarressed for having asked it as soon as the words left my lips.  &#34;Do uhhhh people who are newbies to restaurant industry get whiplash sitting that close to the kitchen?&#34;  Our server took my unfunny and sweatily awkward question and flipped it into a bow-wrapped short story version of how the restaurant came to be.  We were in good hands.The food was hit out of the park and I am procrastinating because I don&#39;t know where to begin.  The new hotdog is so much better than the fine dining dog: it&#39;s like Kevin Hickey supercharged a Superdawg by pimping out each and every ingredient.  All the touches, from the fresh baked poppyseed bun to the chutney of tomato and mustard, superb, and the meaty juicy chef-crafted dog itself makes even our vaunted Vienna Beef taste like a weenie.For an entree the Portuguese style clams and chourico was beyond - beurre blanc richness with citrus and acid for balance. I remember strawberries like 3 ways for dessert, and I am trying not to think about the chocolate peanut butter beignet.  And I would be remiss to point out that on a super hot dog day of summah, Chef was there saying hello to guests in the dining room before heading back to work with the team in the kitchen.I&#39;m going to quote yelp on this one (a first?) and say woohah as good as it gets!",301,5,1,5,-7,5.1061000000000005,2.5690000000000004,0.6239999999999999,19.807000000000006,No
the-duck-inn-chicago,Stephanie D.,v3Qfyym14kzkzbakbI8weg,Ig2hL4xzkRKLPtd75YHqhw,"Duck Inn has been on my radar for a few months now. So I was not only excited that my husband and I finally had a date night planned but also because I&#39;ve heard such amazing things about this place. After reading that the rotisserie duck is a hot item and the restaurant recommends calling ahead of time to request it, I did just that. The woman who answered the phone stated that they are no longer taking requests ahead of time for the day. I guess you have to call a day or two in advance, not the same day as I had tried to do. So I ask if there are any still available at the moment (just to get an idea of whether or not we&#39;d be able to try this much raved about duck). She says yes, so of course we&#39;re stoked since we were actually only about 15 minutes away. The restaurant is definitely a hidden gem for the area. We walked in and we were sat immediately which was nice for 7pm on a Friday. The restaurant was dimly lit but the music inside was louder than expected. Since I love outdoor dining my husband and I opted for seating outside (which was much quieter than inside). The string lights added a nice romantic feel. Fitting for our date night. As soon as the waiter greets us at the table we ask for the duck. Of course he asked if we ordered ahead of time. I stated we called the same day so we were unable to reserve it but we&#39;re told that they still had rotisserie ducks available just a little while prior to us arriving. He sadly stated that they were all out. We obviously were bummed but still had a  positive attitude since the rest of the menu looked great. For apps we had ordered the cheese fries. I ordered the spot prawns with the risotto. My husband had the chicken thigh dinner. Everything was absolutely delicious. However, I have one major complaint. As my husband and I were waiting for our food another couple is seated at the table next to us. When they are greeted by their server (not ours which was Kenny...but another server...a young lady) they also ask for the duck. And again the same question we were asked: Did you place your order ahead of time?  To which the gentleman responds &#34;No. I&#39;ve never had to do that before.&#34;  Then to my surprise whadayaknow, she responds simply with an &#34;ok. No problem&#34;. Like what?!?! We were just told 15 minutes ago that they ran out of the duck! How does that happen? Do they pick and choose who gets duck? We just didn&#39;t understand. We didn&#39;t bring it up to our server because we didn&#39;t want the next table to feel any bad way pointing them out. But looking back, I probably should have spoken to a manager about it. I have to say that even with the delicious food we ate that night, that left such a bad taste in my mouth. We&#39;re not sure what exactly happened but all I know is we we told NO DUCK while another table was told the opposite. Do I still want to go back to Duck Inn and try the duck? Yes! But will I? Probably not. Sadly.",318,3,3,4,68,3.9762999999999984,4.915,2.9779999999999998,36.107,No

And on a citywide curve, it is very good.  The cocktails are intimidating but well-balanced. Rice cake appetizer is simple but excellent, as are the other appetizers -- salmon tartare, potted foie gras, burrata, etc.  The entrees are a little less special, but still tasty.  My only real complaint, and it is a nontrivial one, is that the portions are noticeably smaller and less filling than we expected -- we ended up ordering 5 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 3 desserts for 3 people and still could have used a bit more food. So where does it end up on the curve? Good enough that I could see myself ending up back here (we didn&#39;t get the namesake duck dish or take advantage of the patio) but not so good that I&#39;ll be rushing back.UPDATED TO ADD: A manager contacted me to say that they have revisited some of the items on the menu and increased the portions.

the-duck-inn-chicago,Eva S.,_AlPmtlcv6o-SB3Uv_Z2HA,7pytuLlBBTO-GzY8zKolUA,"I came here with a party of 5 on a Saturday night, eager to try Duck Inn. Our rotisserie duck was already pre-ordered (before 3:30pm that same day) and when we arrived, there was a little rubber ducky on the table to indicate that our duck was prepped and ready. Our server only had to notify the kitchen, and we had to claim our pre-ordered, highly anticipated duck. (We did not get to keep the rubber duck, if you were wondering.)If you check-in on Yelp, you&#39;ll get a free order of chili cheese fries, so that was definitely one of the first orders on our list. Overall we ordered:Drinks all around (I got the Lychee Chuhai)Chili cheese friesFried cheese curds: bloody mary ketchup &amp; hoppy mayoBone in shortrib: string bean ragu, charred onion soubise &amp; red wine saucePasta carbonara: spaghetti, duck egg, braised bacon, pecorinoRotisserie duck: duck drippings potatoes, greens, roasted pear &amp; apple, gooseberry vinaigretteScallop crudo: black garlic vinaigrette, sunchoke pistachio, radish &amp; appleThe four stars are for the drinks and the duck only. So that&#39;s what I&#39;ll mostly expand on. The duck was amazing, I&#39;ve never had it cooked the way they do at The Duck Inn. The meat was tender, the skin a perfect crisp, with a separate container for the gooseberry vinaigrette. It&#39;s $62 (kinda pricey) for a whole duck, which we split as an appetizer between our party.Their drink menu is extensive and fun, and the &#34;Lychee Chuhai&#34; had soju, lychee and lime juice, gomme syrup, and soda. Their menu is seasonal, because I tried to order a drink (from a recommendation by my cousin) and they said they did not currently make it [glimmer of hope] and that I wouldn&#39;t be able to order it [oh well].  I still enjoyed the Asian-inspired drink I opted for.My favorite of the dishes (apart from the duck) was the bone-in short rib. Definitely order this if you&#39;re a meat-eater. The &#34;full&#34; size of the pasta carbonara was... like the size of a small Boston Market side.  As for the cheese curds, I thought the &#34;Bloody Mary ketchup&#34; and the &#34;hoppy mayo&#34; would come in separate tubs, but they came already spread on the bottom of the serving dish, and I was eager for (and expecting) more. At least to dunk into the sauce, you know. I thought that dish fell short there because I like my condiments. Also to keep in mind: their portions are small and not easily shareable for a large party.When I ordered dessert, they were out of the corn ice cream, and our server charged us for the chili cheese fries when we should have gotten it for free. Both issues above were remedied, but service was average. It seemed like a night of second options, and we needed to be vigilant about our bill.This place is $$$$$$. Ideally, I&#39;d skip the food here and think of Duck&#39;s Inn as a drink spot only with the exception of the rotisserie duck. It&#39;s the fanciness that one would expect, with men wearing jackets and couples on one of their first handfuls of dates.When I mentioned jokingly to a friend after we paid our bill, &#34;So after this, &#34;McDonalds?&#34; With fiery wit she replied, &#34;For the next few days!&#34; (referring to the price of our meal).

It&#39;s rare to find a spot of it&#39;s supposed caliber outside of the restaurant hot spot areas of The City, so being located in Bridgeport immediately peeked my interest. I really wanted The Duck Inn to be an all around great time, but unfortunately I left pretty disappointed. I want to stress that the entire experience wasn&#39;t bad. The food was outstanding and the atmosphere was really nice, but that&#39;s where The Duck Inns impressiveness ended. I went on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, excited to sit and enjoy the weather on their spacious back patio. Each item we ordered was delicious, but the portion sizes were ridiculously small for prices. Most restaurants in River North and the West Loop demanding the same prices offer much larger portions, so I find it pretty pretentious for the Duck Inn to command the same considering its location. My biggest issue was the service. It was simply horrible. The place was in no way busy, yet we waited far too long for everything. I watched several servers walk by our table 4 or 5 times while our water  and drink glasses remained completely empty. I had to get up and ask a server for water. This is never acceptable. After ordering a second drink and waiting over 20 minutes without seeing our server, I had to walk inside to the bar to let them know we no longer wanted the drink we had been waiting for and simply wanted our check. Once the server brought our check, I noticed that there were beers we never even ordered on the bill. The issue was fixed, however, there were no apologies offered. I really wanted to like The Duck Inn.I hate giving bad reviews, because in most bad situations, I really feel that it&#39;s out of the ordinary and if given an another chance the establishment would most likely redeem itself.

We pass this place on our way to work and he always mentions how it&#39;s supposed to be a really great restaurant. I saw the rave reviews so I booked a reservation. On the reservations, it asks if you want the rotisserie duck because they have to prepare it ahead of time. I put no, but when I was seated, I was given this tiny little duck. It tells your waitress that you ordered the rotisserie duck. I told them there must have been a mistake. However, then we chose to accept the error and eat yummy duck.While we waited for that, we ordered chili cheese fries and cheese curds. The cheese fries were average. The cheese curds, though. OMG they were amazing. They aren&#39;t your run-of-the-mill cheese curds. They were light and soft. I actually wish we ordered two of those instead of one of each.Then, our duck came out on this beautiful wooden block on top of a kale salad. It looked so good. We also got the saut’©ed mushrooms, which was recommended by our waitress (she was great by the way). Both dishes were so delicious. We couldn&#39;t finish everything. A whole duck is pretty huge for two people. Four people could have eaten that thing.So after all that and asking the duck to go, we got dessert. When will we come back? We don&#39;t know, so we seized the moment and ordered two scoops of strawberry and tarragon. It was such a different flavor because that tarragon gave it an earthy kick.

Lumpia, is Filipino style eggrolls, but these to me are much more Vietnamese style, but that&#39;s just semantics.  They are pretty much all duck meat with a bit of carrot and mushrooms mixed throughout. They earned my Asian stamp of approval for unique yet authentic style egg rolls!The Duck, the house specialty and namesake of this restaurant, was fantastic and cooked perfectly. The breasts come with crispy skin and medium rare, the dark meat is tender and flavorful.  It&#39;s a pretty decent sized portion, and the 2 of us girls ended up taking home about 1/4 of the meal. For dessert we shared the chocolate beignet with banana anglase and peanut butter ice cream. This flavor, texture and temperature combination was heavenly, and absolutely worth saving a bit of space for at the end. The only downside was I felt the drink I ordered, while tasty, seemed light on the alcohol and not particularly imaginatively presented. For specialty cocktail prices, I expected a little more effort for presentation. Overall, I would absolutely return here again. I&#39;m particularly interested to see their patio as the weather warms up !",145,4,2,5,20,4.3202,1.8399999999999999,0.095,12.065,No

However, this place is definitely worth the trek. Cocktails are amazing at this place and people were saying the same thing as they were leaving the Duck Inn. The bar greets you as soon as you enter the, then the dining area, followed by a patio.  What makes this place unique is the food menu, of course. I mean, most people don&#39;t have duck everyday so the food stands out and they&#34;ve done a good job. I even had a vegetarian option, the sticky fingers, which is made of rice flour and then seared. It too was delicious.

I absolutely loved the decor. Whoever they hired as their interior decorator/designer sure got it right.Service could use a tad of work (couldn&#39;t find our server for some time when finishing the meal &amp; waiting for the check) but overall, we were treated quite well.It does get completely packed, even during brunch, so be sure to make a reservation. They are on Open Table so rack up those points!Everything we ate was indulgent but oh-so-worth the millions of calories.~Duck Fat Hot Dog $10 - Mmm Mmm Good! This hot dog is served Chicago style as any respectable hot dog should be! Great flavor and was well worth trying.~Duck Hash $15  - Large portion with many ingredients thrown in....Brussels Sprouts, Wisconsin Cheddar, Breadcrumbs, soft scrambled egg and of course the duck.~Bacon $6 - THIS CAN&#39;T BE REAL LIFE! This is not just bacon. They call this a &#39;filet&#39; of bacon. #truth It is so thick, cooked so perfectly and melted in my mouth. It&#39;s a bold statement, but I do declare Duck Inn&#39;s bacon the best in Chicago! Better than The Publican.~Cheese Curd Grits $8 - served with bloody mary ketchup (how cool!) and hoppy mayo (nomz). Cheese curds? Good. Grits? Good. Together? Party in my mouth. Loved this dish.~Bubblegum cocktail $10 - This was quite an interesting drink served in a tiny glass bottle, served sealed to me. Aylesbury Duck, Giffard Banane du Br’©sil, Watermelon, Pineapple, Wintergreen Tonkaroma, Lemon, Gomme and CO2, Clearly a lot of thought went into this well crafted &amp; strong morning beverage. The fizzy carbonation of this drink gives it a fun feel.~Orange juice is $5...oy. Too dang much paper for a glass of OJ.Damage - $74 + tip brunch. Could be worse. It was an expensive brunch for 2 but we had leftovers and left feeling completely satiated.Duck Inn has a chill vibe and their food is fabulous!

Drinks are decent but the poor waitress had to take ten minutes to explain all the strange liquors and names as there were no descriptors for these. Vegetarian options: mushrooms were the best. The barrata (not sure on my spelling here, apologies) was not nearly as good as the mushrooms. My partner loved the duck wings.

We made our reservation well in advance, and thankfully, after reading several yelp reviews, pre-ordered our duck as well. We were lucky enough to sit front row of the chef&#39;s table. A tiny yellow rubber duck was waiting for us there to signify that we had pre-ordered one. I felt like I was transported right into a Food Network cooking show. It was fascinating to watch so many chefs in such a small kitchen create perfection on a plate. We started with the cheese curds. Not greasy at all, and just the right ooey gooeyness about them. While we wanted to order more small plates, we had a duck coming, so we opted not to. What we saw leaving the kitchen that looked amazing was the foie gras and the duck wings. Both will be on our to order list next time. When our duck arrived, it was beautifully presented on a wooden cutting board with mixed greens, watermelon radishes, potatoes, and the decadent duck drippings. The duck skin was crispy, the meat juicy. There was no conversation during our meal except a few times where we commented on how delicious it was. Dessert. Don&#39;t skip it. My husband ordered the peanut butter ice cream with coffee nibs and chocolate beignet. So great. But what was even better was that the chef made us an extra dessert. Not sure why, but I wasn&#39;t going to send it back. Vanilla ice cream surrounded by strawberries and a strawberry glaze of sorts with edible flowers. This brought me to heaven. Thanks chef!The staff was welcoming, friendly, not over-bearing or snotty. We met Mark, who delivered our duck, and had a great time talking with him about the restaurant and the Bridgeport area. I wish I had gotten everyone&#39;s name to compliment them, but I was too busy enjoying the succulence of Duck Inn. Bravo all!",214,5,3,5,64,8.732000000000001,5.141,0.298,21.561,No

H.,yBDKWxJTnwBdbl8Yma8qqg,BE5xoqMKCR3yWYqS72n8Wg,"If you travel to The Duck Inn on foot, you might think you had taken a wrong turn off Archer because this hidden gem is nestled at the edge of a decidedly residential neighborhood. I hope its place at the end of a row of modest homes will keep it from getting overcrowded, especially into the summer when the patio will open. Decor is very hip mid-century, but not aggressively so unlike The Sixth up in Lincoln Square. I would say the boldest things about The Duck Inn is its playlist of (neo)soul and Motown and the cocktail list. The music plays at a sufficient volume to be another voice in the L-shaped dining area where most patrons can talk comfortably to their companions without fighting to be heard over the other tables. The cocktails have ambitious ingredient lists of lesser-known brands and house-made mixers. The Anton Chigurh came in a modestly cut hock glass looking like blood and tasting of smoke and fruit. Rather alcohol-forward with a silky, almost heavy mouthfeel. Richly sweet enough that I almost regretted having it as a drink before dinner. Dinner consisted of the fried cheese curds - perfectly executed with a light crispy batter exterior and accompanying piquant sauce, the shrimp and duck lumpia - again, well-fried but the shrimp overpowered the duck, and the duck fat dog that is listed under bar snacks but was big enough for dinner for one or substantial snack for two. Casing had a nice resiliency to it that was not quite snappy, interior was juicy and deeply flavorful, mustard was savory and sweet, jalapeno slivers were fresh and hot, and the lightly poppy seeded bun had a nice sweet wash exterior and fluffy airy interior. Dessert was the sticky toffee pudding, presented in the form of a slightly wider, slightly flatter canele, a deep brown caramelized exterior encasing a soft cake-like interior, in a pool of toffee and paired with an ovoid of luscious spiced rum whipped cream. I think I would have wanted just a little more dessert, but I appreciate the quiet confidence with which The Duck Inn approached all aspects of the dining experience, from composition to presentation to environment. I also had the Lake City French Roast (method: pour over); good coffee albeit a little weak for my taste - I am, however, a French press coffee person. All in all, a big hit in my current New American phase and I look forward to returning for the rotisserie duck dinner for two.",286,5,3,5,66,4.934,1.916,0.45199999999999996,12.632000000000001,No

This place was so fun and so tasty and so 5 star worthy, I want to go back right now. We went for brunch, but I can only imagine how dinner compares, since brunch was pretty perfect. We got seated at the chef&#39;s table for our group so we could watch each dish be prepared, each dish get called out, each dish get its last cleaning before it was sent out to its soon to be enjoyer. It added so much to our dining experience, that now I want to sit at this table every time I dine here! We definitely made friends through the kitchen too since we ended up with a comped funnel cake that was fried and crisped to perfection, that was the perfect way to end our brunch on a sweet note. But before that sweetness, we got the duck confit hash that had pieces of duck all throughout it and great onions and eggs and sauces--it was no surprise to me that this was the most pictured brunch dish. We also got the duck fat fried potatoes which we found difficult to politely share since they had just the right amount of crispness to them. The squash panzanella salad also had the perfect amount of buttermilk dressing--and yes I am aware I am using the word perfect so frequently in this review, because that is how I felt about this whole experience! The chorizo omelette was also loved by all and my bloody mary was such great spice and their house gin fizz was the most magical and tasty drink we have had in quite some time. The retro vibe here with an outdoor patio I know will keep this place going, and don&#39;t let the industrial nature of this place&#39;s neighbors steer you away--you need to eat here. So I say again, Duck yeah, Duck Inn.",179,5,2,5,32,7.055299999999999,4.068999999999999,0.212,8.719,No

We pre-ordered a whole duck, and ordered the fried cheese curds, shrimp and duck lumpia, crispy chicken thigh and I want to say the braised beef... and then toffee pudding and malted chocolate and peanut butter ice cream. Everything hands down was amazing--- the cheese curds and lumpia were great starters, and indicative of a great meal to come. The rotisserie duck was a lot of people&#39;s favorite at the table--- especially since you could choose your dark meat or white meat, and there was the duck dripping potatoes and sauce--- so flavorful and made full use of the whole duck. My personal favorite was the crispy chicken thigh, which I at first did not want to order because I have a similar recipe at home that I&#39;ve made often and thought that I personally make a good one---- until I tried The Duck Inn&#39;s version and realized how mediocre mine is compared to theirs. The chicken was SO crispy but juicy at the same time, and it just all tied in together so well with everything on the plate.

Some amazing shrimp &amp; duck lumpia, a phillippino spring roll that was perfectly spicy, sweet and crispy. The duck wings were perfect. The rice cakes with kimchi aioli were the most amazing texture, like an extra crispy cheese-less mozzarella stick.

At the suggestion of our waiter, we started with the cheese curds (with an amazing Bloody Mary ketchup) and the prawns with risotto. I probably could&#39;ve had another order of each to myself. We also shared two orders of the duck. We hadn&#39;t realized you have to order the duck ahead of time, but they were having a slow day and had a few extra on hand. Lucky us. I thought the duck was perfectly cooked, but hubs had wished it was a little rarer. Each person was able to have a juicy breast as well as a leg with crispy skin that melted in your mouth. The spread was accompanied by roasted potatoes and a salad with strawberries, which offered a  nice, bright contrast to the rest of the meal.For dessert we had the toffee pudding, which was just OK. We thought it would be ooey-gooey like monkey bread, but it was a little drier and accompanied by a sauce.Overall, we had a perfect evening and will definitely be back.

As a destination location The Duck Inn is worth the trip.  The ambiance is great and welcoming as is the staff.  We were very excited to delve into the unique cocktails and enticing menu items.  Particularly duck...(it&#39;s kinda in the name and all).  For starters we ordered fried cheese curds and roasted mushrooms.  We were also told that if we wanted duck we needed to order it ASAP and they had to check to see if there were any left.  This was a little peculiar as I would imagine a place that specialized in duck would have plenty on hand.  But any way, we definitely jumped on the opportunity to grab a rotisserie duck.  While waiting we downed a few cocktails and enjoyed the scenery.  The mushrooms came and were phenomenal!  The duck arrived and was slightly less spectacular.  I mean it looked great but not what we expected when you imagine &#34;rotisserie&#34; duck.  It was two leg/thigh quarters and two breasts sliced on the bias.  Again, not really complaining just wasn&#39;t what we pictured or expected.  Also it appeared to be flashed in the fryer to get a crispy finish.  The duck was tasty albeit ever so slightly over cooked.  All in all we enjoyed our evening.  Oh did you think I forgot about the cheese curds?  Oh well that&#39;s because we got them as a dessert after asking about them three times throughout the evening.  All was good though.

The food is fantastic.  A hidden gem on the menu is the hamburger sandwich.   Yes, calling it a hamburger sandwich does add a lot of pretense to the dish but it is still a winnner. The combination of the rye bread with the grilled onions and cheese makes this one a well balanced earthy winner.I also had the Duck Fat Dog which is a dish that makes this place worth visiting in it&#39;s own right.  The Chicago style dog benefits from a mild and even slightly sweet mustard that complements the tasty dog with good snapback.  I really don&#39;t understand how the dog can sell for only $10.Drinks wise, though I did enjoy the Pineapple mimosas that I had at brunch, I was a little disapponted by the Lychee Chuhai.

So my first visit was last night for dinner.Driving to the restaurant was kinda weird because it&#39;s empty and desolate coming from Cermak. Then you see homes, then you see a cutely lit, unassuming building that looks a former neighborhood corner bar (remember those Chicago?)The interior is very pretty. The front part of the restaurant is the bar. Then you keep walking towards the back, through some french doors and you reach the restaurant part of it. It&#39;s kinda small but it&#39;s intimate and it feels cozy. We were able to sit at the Chef&#39;s Table. We were going to order the duck, but turns out they had just ran out! Boooo! Since my date was way more familiar with the menu, I went with his suggestions on plates that we could share. For starters we got the Duck Wings and the Fried Cheese Curds. The Duck Wings were good. The meat was a little dry for my liking, but the sauce was FIYAH! Kinda messy, but very finger-lickin&#39; good. The Cheese Curds were super tasty! They weren&#39;t your standard bar fried cheese curds. They were light and the cheese was soft. The Bloody Mary Ketchup I probably could have done without, but it didn&#39;t ruin the goodness of the curds.For our main courses we went with 3 dishes: The Bone In Shortrib, Berkshire Pork Shoulder, and the Gyros Plate. The Gyros Plate was good. Very flavorful. The Shortrib was really good. The meat was tender and delicious. My favorite plate of them was hands down, the Pork Shoulder. Wow, what a great dish! The creamy fregola was addicting! Initially, I was worried ordering 3 entrees would be way too much food. But, with the 2 starters, it was just enough food. Which I guess I can understand why some people would be disappointed. Portions aren&#39;t big here at all and overall it kinda is pricey. But the quality is phenomenal. Speaking of quality, everything on the menu is made in-house.  OMG, I almost forgot to mention the cocktails! My date was drinking the Old Fashioned, and I went with the Kingdom of Koryo. The Kingdom of Koryo was light and refreshing. I think it&#39;s better suited for the warm days out on the patio. But both cocktails were very tasty! Service was awesome. Our server, Jackie, was very nice and explained the menu well.After dinner, we went up to the bar to continue with cocktails for the remainder of the night and it was super chill. Overall, a great place! I can see myself coming back to try other items on the menu.TL;DR Version: Awesome place! Great service. Quality food. Tasty cocktails. Great date spot. Get the Berkshire Pork Shoulder.

On one visit, we tried 4 different types of old fashioned and were very pleased. Dishes are rotating from season to season and you can&#39;t go wrong with your meat choices here. Gyros plate are super tasty; pork shoulders are very tender and the combination of the short rib with the ragu are nothing but perfect.

I must say this place is phenomenal for a restaurant that is not to big and not to small. I sat outside with some of my friends and It was cozy. I had the tasting menu for the James Beard week and all the dishes on the menu was excellent. I had steak tartar which the flavor was on point to spread on grill bread. Second I had the potato gnocchi with prosciutto and peas which was so tasty and delicious. Third I had the rainbow trout with the fris’©e salad on top was great and flavorful. For dessert I had an ice cream sorbet and it was delicious. The waitress was so attentive and make sure we were enjoying our food. I would definitely go back to this place in a heartbeat and try other dishes on the menu and I would definitely recommend it to others.,84,5,2,5,25,4.4131,1.843,0.0,8.156999999999998,No

If you don&#39;t have time to read the rest of my long review, here&#39;s your main takeaway: Make sure to call ahead and reserve a Rotisserie Duck.Came here on a Wednesday night to celebrate my boyfriend&#39;s birthday, and had a great time. It&#39;s unassuming on the outside (literally the only restaurant in a residential neighborhood), but once we stepped inside, we were greeted by modern furniture and lighting, and a very friendly hostess.After we were seated in a cozy spot with a view of both the patio and semi open-concept kitchen, my boyfriend knew exactly what to do first. Did you know that their chili cheese fries are free with a Yelp check in? :) We also put an order of the Spot Prawns as appetizers. Our starters came out quickly, as well as a rubber duck to signify the Rotisserie Duck we ordered. Cute touch! Spot Prawns were perfectly cooked, and the risotto was very tasty. I&#39;ve never had Sea Beans before, but the acidic flavor was a pleasant surprise, and blended well with the rest of the dish. Chili Cheese fries were good too, but nothing to rave about. We really came for the duck! Needless to say, our expectations were fulfilled.Shortly after we finished our starters, the duck came out. It was beautifully presented on a wooden board, on top of a mix of swiss chard, roasted pears, apples, and potatoes with a little steel server of duck jus. Everything was cooked perfectly, the duck was tender, flavorful and complemented by the fruit and vegetables. And the duck jus, yum! Contrary to other Yelpers, the portion was just fine for us because we finished the entire dish!At the end of our meal, when we were too full to even contemplate dessert, the manager came out with a small birthday treat for my boyfriend - a chocolate ice cream cone! It was a very thoughtful gesture that I didn&#39;t expect to receive when I made the reservation on OpenTable.All in all, Duck Inn was a very pleasant dining experience. You can tell how much care they put into the details. Will be back!",236,4,2,5,38,9.4033,4.411999999999999,0.0,19.588,No

the-duck-inn-chicago,Daphne L.,mingPqM7hzXu68DdgUQflg,sF0Yy_-RNZtrTT49C9K4kA,"I&#39;m a life long Chicago resident, grew up on the South Side, and am a black woman. I didn&#39;t spend time in Bridgeport growing up, cause, back in the day there wasn&#39;t anywhere worth going in Bridgeport (sorry, it&#39;s true), and, honestly, if you were black, that&#39;s the last place you wanted to be. The only places I went in that neighborhood were Comiskey and Henry&#39;s Bait Shop with my dad for fishing stuff..that&#39;s it. Last summer my husband was out with friends and he came home with glowing remarks about this place they stopped..Duck, something. I initially told him &#34;Bridgeport? No thank you.&#34; and had no intention of visiting. Fast forward to this spring and we see Duck Inn featured on an episode of &#34;Check, Please&#34; and subsequently hear rave reviews about it from friends. Some of my friends told me that they fully understood my hesitation, and also approached the idea with some side eye, but, had a great time. I&#39;m here to tell you that they were right, and Duck Inn is fantastic. We have started hitting hot spots at the blue-hair hour on weekends, so we&#39;re usually guaranteed to get a table if we don&#39;t have reservations. We got to Duck Inn between 4:30-5:00 on a Saturday, scored a table on the lovely patio, and settled in for what was a perfect evening. Our server was so friendly, so kind, full of great recommendations, and just a lovely young woman. Everyone on staff we interacted with was equally lovely. We ordered several small plates to share: shrimp &amp; duck lumpia, cheese curds, duck wings, spot prawns, and, the braised pork belly. Don&#39;t judge, we were hungry. Everything was delicious..damn delicious. We are big fans of lumpia, and their version was a nice change from the usual. The cheese curds are light and airy, not at all heavy, and, not greasy which I hate. The duck wings were good, not mind blowing, but we ate all of them. The spot prawns with risotto was heaven and perfectly seasoned. I am craving it still today, and won&#39;t share the next time I am there. The braised pork belly was also perfectly cooked and seasoned, and I really liked the pairing of the heirloom beans. We were so stuffed by the time we finished that there was no way he had room for desert, so, I&#39;m ready to go back so I can try the beignets.Also? Next time? I&#39;m for sure getting the rotisserie duck, which looks so good.Duck Inn is kind of off the beaten path, or at least it seems like it is, but parking was a breeze. The inside is artfully designed and I absolutely love the lights over the tables. In the winter I&#39;d probably make a reservation, as I can imagine it gets crowded and there isn&#39;t a ton of room in the bar area. In 10,000 years I never thought I&#39;d visit any business in Bridgeport, but, I thoroughly enjoyed Duck Inn and will be back as often as possible.",336,5,2,5,11,10.6882,5.413999999999999,1.0750000000000002,24.509999999999998,No

I&#39;ve heard and read great things about this place, but was not as impressed as I thought I would be. The best dish we ordered was the duck hash. Flavorful, but couldn&#39;t detect a distinct duck taste. The duck wings and lumpia were good. However the wings were warm and were pretty similar to other wings out there (great seas on Lawrence). Finally the chili fries were delish. Great drink menu too. Overall a unique spot for the neighborhood. Probably wouldn&#39;t go out of the way to go to Bridgeport considering I live on the northside where L&amp;E, Gather, and Parachute are a short walk/drive away.",81,4,2,3,18,2.1294000000000004,1.6059999999999999,0.152,8.242,No

This place was really disappointing. The design was interesting, I really liked the lay out and light fixtures.  Local draft list with a couple gems. The cocktail list looked very interesting but I didn&#39;t try one.  I came for Saturday lunch and the menu wasn&#39;t very interesting. Maybe for dinner they break out some heavier hitters.  The duck wings were dry and the Japanese bbq didn&#39;t have any listing flavor. It was colored as if bbq sauce was applied but there was no taste. Very little meat on the wings, mostly fat, lead to a disappointing bite. Fries on the side were about as generic as you can. Not crunchy and missing seasoning.  Perhaps I got the wrong things, but due to the location and boring food, this is a place I have no need to ever come back.

I have not been more satisfied with a meal in a very long time.You will definitely need a reservation decently in advance and when you make it, make sure you say you want the duck.The only downside to this restaurant is where it is.

Duck service it delish, duh, it&#39;s kinda their thing. Dinner menu is outstanding but a little out of our budget for a regular weeknight. Friday and Saturday nights can also get very loud. The general manager did let us know about a weeknight neighborhood discount, we just haven&#39;t been able to stop by on a weeknight yet. Each time we&#39;ve been by, a manager or someone who seems to be in charge stops by and checks on everything.The bar menu is more affordable (though you can still do some damage if you&#39;re drinking and eating) and just our speed. The duck hot dog is huge and messy and delicious. Cheese curds with house made ketchup is made to share but I didn&#39;t. The beer list and cocktail menu are really well curated, but order a Manhattan and let the bartender do his thing and you can&#39;t go wrong. If you&#39;re a cheap date like me, two Manhattans here will take you from zero to eating a coffee cake on your couch at home in sweatpants in what seems like 4 minutes flat (although according to interested parties, it was actually more like 3 hours, and involved my demand that we pull over to purchase said coffee cake).",143,4,1,3,-8,2.2404,1.4740000000000002,0.49,10.036,No
the-duck-inn-chicago,Melissa A.,D9i3LUq4UHh9rg62kym8yA,tjn0dIL17PLBSaTH44MIcQ,"I love that the Duck Inn has themed dinners/events throughout the year and I came last night for their &#34;Luau Night&#34;.  Who doesn&#39;t love a good theme??  Unfortunately I did not come in a Hawaiian shirt but if I had one I would have worn it since my dining companion has a strong distaste for them (and what&#39;s more fun than annoying people).  We were told when making reservations that we had to let The Duck Inn know ahead of time if we were joining them for the Luau but when we were seated our waitress told us about the special and I think we would have been fine had we just walked in.  The Luau dinner was All-You-Can-Eat for $35 and included roasted suckling pig, Hawaiian buns, garlic rice, poi, Polynesian noodles salad, purple sweet potato salad, and a creamy fruit salad for dessert.  Drinks were not included in the dinner and the drink special of the evening was $9 Spam Mai Tais, yes you heard me SPAM MAI TAIs.  What can I tell you, my eyes are always bigger than my stomach.  I wish I could have eaten more because the food was pretty awesome.  My favorite part was the suckling pig and I highly recommend stopping by one of their Luaus to try it.  The pork was tender, juicy, had a nice roasted flavor and the 2 sauces that it was served with were delicious.  One sauce I believe was like a spicy mayo based sauce and the other tasted like Hoisin sauce to be honest.  The sides were tasty as well but none really stood out too much to me.  The noodle salad tasted like your typical macaroni salad with chunks of spam I believe and the sweet potato salad tasted like just that, potato salad.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, none of them were bad but none were amazing.  If you&#39;re wondering what Poi is, it&#39;s a Hawaiian staple made of taro and has a very sticky/viscous consistency.  Now let&#39;s get to the Spam Mai Tais.  These cocktails are served adorably in the Spam Can with a leaf and straw.  I overheard our waitress telling the table next to us that spam is used in the process of making the alcoholic component but no actual spam is in the final drink.  You can only taste a slight slight hint of spam in the end product but it adds an interesting twist.  I recommend trying it because why not!Our waitress as well as the other wait staff were very friendly and helpful throughout the night.  They all seemed to work together which I definitely appreciate since it shows community.  Someone was always there to fill our water, check on us, and clear the plates away when we were done since our table was pretty tiny.  From the exterior, The Duck Inn looks like a casual neighborhood bar/restaurant but when you walk in the d’©cor is pretty chic but laid back.  There is a full bar as well as tables with booth seats on one side of the table.  I didn&#39;t get a chance to see the patio but I have a feeling it is welcoming and nicely decorated.  All I could see over the fence was some umbrellas and lights making it seem as though you&#39;re dining in your friend&#39;s backyard patio, pretty quaint right? I can&#39;t wait to come back and try their Rotisserie Duck as well as their Sunday brunch.

For French fine dining, this place is reasonably priced with quality food. Compared to other fine dining, the portion is quite generous and executed with care. Service was great and we met the chef! The menu was very limited, which I really like because each entree can be made with care. The specialty cocktail menu was extensive and reasonably price which would be comparably to any fancy downtown restaurant. I rate on quality over price! We had 4 people and literally ordered everything on the menu. Exception was the potted foie gras, sunchoke appetizier, and the apple dessert (not avail). Lychee cocktail - it was refreshing and taste more like a lychee soda and was lightly carbonated. The alcohol is very light in flavor. Roasted Duck for 2  - This is a whole rotisserie duck with grapefruit dressing and tangerine sauce. The size of the duck is a smaller version of a rotisserie chicken. It was served on a wooden board. The skin was crispy, the juicy meat was tender and medium rare. The taste was amazingly tasteful especially with the sauce. You must try it to believe it. Berkshire Pork shoulder was complimented with mash potato- Again, tasteful and tender. Very well complimented with the roasted apple and celery puree to balance the flavor.Great Lakes Walleye with sunchoke and potatoe puree, broccoli and winter citrus salad, and toasted hazelnut - At first, I didn&#39;t care to order because it didnt sound too appetizing. The fish was flaky and cook to perfection. The compliments along with the fish was very enjoyable. Chicken thigh - presented with slice filet of the chicken. It was tender and juicy. Complimented with beet salad. Spotted prawn risotto with uni butter - omg.. soo delicious and creamy!Tasting menu: 3 oysters in 3 different style (rockefeller, beef tartare, and viet style), black truffle short rib with pomegranate, and dessert. The short rib was tender and we can cut it with a fork. It was very tasteful and the sweetness of the pomegranate with the meat was good. Dessert:Red Velvet baked Alaska with beet blood orange sorbet and beet caramel cream cheese ice cream - it tasted more like red velvet and the flavor of beet was not potent. Overall, lightly flavor and tad of tanginess from the orange sorbet. It was nicely presentedToffee pudding - This was everything&#39;s favorite. Chocolate beignet with banana anglaise and peanut butter ice cream - beignet looked more like a donut, but very soft. The banana sauce and the chocolate goes well together. I&#39;m ok with peanut butter ice cream. Overall, everything was nicely presented and I&#39;m glad to have such a quality restaurant close to home.

Long wait between courses. A fifteen minute wait for dessert, etc.  I think the ? ma’Âtre d noticed how exasperated we were starting to look because he came to take our food order. Attentive guy :)The food was on point. - Fried cheese curds tasted like mozzarella sticks to me (good but nothing out of this world).

This was complimentary by the ma’Âtre d&#39;’étre because our gnocchi took ten years to arrive. It was very thoughtful of him.- steak tartare - this was from the tasting menu, and it was scrumptious, especially with the pumpernickel.  We wolfed this down.- cornmeal gnocchi - another winner and I don&#39;t even like gnocchi, heh. Tender, delicate but buttery flavor with delicious spring peas.- spring rolls - nothing special here but tasty nonetheless.For mains, the chicken thigh was good.

the-duck-inn-chicago,P B.,MLVon5TRCWngzjyDVJUkFw,8fJxRcPSlv48kVhUPq4NUw,"Hey Duck Inn, you won me over on my first visit and this would have been a 5-star review.  The food, cocktails and service (at a table) during my first visit were top-notch!HOWEVER, I returned for a friend&#39;s birthday on the Tuesday between Christmas and New Year&#39;s, as an impromptu cocktail stop at her request, since she was a part of my first visit to the Duck Inn.  We arrived, there were open chairs at the bar, so we bellied-up.  While the taste of the cocktails and the beer offerings were great, the service was not.  Three bartenders or technically two bartenders and one bar-back and it was like we were invisible.  The bar-back was the friendliest and was able to hold a brief conversation as he was doing his preparations.  The two actual bartenders were way too engaged in their &#39;craft&#39; to make us feel welcomed.  Even the owner was mesmerized by one of the bartenders, as he stood there videoing the bartender as he made a slew of identical drinks.Around 6:30pm, I shouted to a friend of mine that the Hawks game was on at 7pm.  We didn&#39;t know they had a tv, since it wasn&#39;t on; but, one of the two bartenders (tall, thin, pierced face) immediately responded and said &#34;we can put that on.&#34;  So, instead of leaving to head somewhere to watch the game, we decided to stay since we could watch some of the game there.  7pm came, tv still not on.  7:15pm came, tv still not on. During this time, not only did I remind the bartender who said &#34;we can put that on&#34;; but, two of my friends reminded him at different times and barely any eye contact was made as he continued to stay focused on his cocktails.  7:30pm came and still no tv on.  It was at my friend&#39;s request that I didn&#39;t launch my displeasure with the service at the bartender, the manager and the owner - all who where within view.7:35, the tv finally comes on.  Yes, the Duck Inn is NOT a sports bar.  We had no intention of staying to watch the game there as we didn&#39;t even know they had a tv since it&#39;s hidden nicely behind what looks like a mirror; but, when a bartender tells you that he&#39;ll put the game on for you and you decide to stay and order more drinks as a result, it&#39;s complete BS when he&#39;s over an hour late in delivering, even after 3 of us remind him at different times.Finally, while we were waiting for the tv to come on, I mentioned to the bar-back that it was my friend&#39;s birthday and if the Duck Inn did anything special, to please do it for my friend.  I wasn&#39;t sure if the Duck Inn did anything special, especially just for those having cocktails at the bar.  He gave a smile and said &#34;sure.&#34;  I saw him inform the &#34;we can put that on&#34; bartender.  Lo n behold, nothing.We stayed until we finished our additional round of drinks, paid and left with a sour taste in our mouth.  Such a different experience than our first.We all agreed that we&#39;ll think twice about returning given the inconsistent experience and definitely not just for drinks, for a special occasion or not, with the potential of dealing with bartenders who don&#39;t realize they have jobs because people come there, spend money and expect to have an overall good or even great experience.... that being personable and making customers feel special is part of the full experience of what is being paid for.  If all you want to do is show your immaturity or be self-absorbed while you whip up cocktails in your own little world, then do it at home, not at any bar or restaurant.  If I was the manager, you&#39;d be on a short leash to quickly pick up the social side of the job. Even if you make great cocktails, if my customers are not happy, then I am not happy = you no longer employed.",406,3,1,5,-2,6.508000000000001,2.769,0.663,27.568999999999996,No

My new favorite place! Friday night marked our first visit to The Duck Inn. We arrived before our reservations, sat at the bar, and enjoyed some original cocktail creations. While the cocktail list isn&#39;t long ( and I&#39;m sure wishes would be accommodated) it was one free of all the tired cocktail characters (like the mojito, plain martini, etc.). The brains behind the bar deliciousness was Brandon, a passionate mixologist.  Once seated, we choose the prix fixe Valentine&#39;s Special and listed ordered the Burrata. Oh. My. Gawd.  We were in heaven! Such wonderful and unexpected combinations garnished with delicious edible flowers. Ectascy. Just writing this review, my mouth begins to water. I&#39;d be doing a serious injustice to our experience of I didn&#39;t mention how welcoming and attentive every single person on their staff was. It felt as if every single person seemed to have made iy their personal mission to be as hospitable to us as possible. JJ, the manager, went above and beyond,  regularly stopping by,  checking in, himself taking plates away snd describing dishes. Now you know why it is my new favorite place,  go!

the-duck-inn-chicago,Greg Q.,5baDh5NyhlXbqBKyCqmBqg,XVnd4xvfD59knO3-_Wz0-g,"I had very high hopes for The Duck Inn and unfortuanely they didn&#39;t deliver.  We arrived on-time for a 730pm reservation and weren&#39;t actually sat until after 8pm. There wasn&#39;t any meaningful apology, explanation of the delay, offer for a drink at the bar.  To make it worse there really isn&#39;t a lot of space in the bar area to wait if it&#39;s a busy night so we spent 30 minutes standing in the middle of the restaurant in everyone&#39;s way.  The hosts and management really didn&#39;t seem to think that having to wait that long when you have a reservation is an issue.Sticking with service, our server was fine but not really on top of things.  She was very friendly but would leave us waiting for long periods of time.  The best example is that she dropped off dessert menus and didn&#39;t come back for 20 minutes.  We had to flag her down just to get the check.The space is small, cramped, and very very noisy.  Definitely don&#39;t come here if you want a quiet meal.  We were sat at a table right next to the kitchen which had good and bad points.  It was cool to see how the kitchen was run but it was also very distracting.Now on to the food...we had some really good ones and one not so good dish:Rotisserie Duck: We pre-ordered this the day before and was definitely a dissapointment.  I know that it was supposed to be cooked medium-rare, but it was more on the rare side.  It reminded us of eating raw poulty and a few of us couldn&#39;t even get it down.  The pieces that were cooked enough to eat were quite bland.Gyros Plate:  This was amazing.  Everyone in our party wanted more of this and found it to be the best dish of the night.  Definitely a must have.Roasted Mushrooms: Also amazing. They were full of flavor and a big hit with our group.Duck Wings: These were perfect.  Crispy with a tasty suace.  We should have gotten two orders:Cheese Curds: I&#39;m normally not a cheese curd person, but these were fried to perfection and had a good sauce.  We licked the plate clean.Based on the overall experience, I won&#39;t be back and I don&#39;t recommend trying this place.  I can&#39;t get over poor service.

Once you go quack, you never go....well you know where I&#39;m going with that. Due to it&#39;s popularity, the duck needs to be pre-ordered so there is enough for everyone. We didn&#39;t know, but to our luck, they had ONE extra that we were able to snatch up. It was WELL worth it. Even at their price. Additionally, the tasting menu was also exquisite. One of us ordered the duck, the other got the tasting menu. So we were able to try the best of everything this place had to offer. And that&#39;s quite a lot. The only downside was, unfortunately, dessert. All the effort put into the food, leaves the dessert something to be desired. So, just an FYI.

Then I called back and half of what I wanted wasn&#39;t available.  I guess they don&#39;t update their menu online.  I understand this is probably more of a dine-in type restaurant.  Anyways, after some suggestions we ordered our food.  We had the chicken, chili cheese fries, potted foie gras, roasted mushrooms and a pork dish.  Everything was delicious!  Especially the chili cheese fries!  The worst part was the long brown hair I found in my chicken. Ew.  I understand things happen, but hopefully they will be more diligent on cooks and food handlers wearing hair nets or tying their hair back.  At the end, this won&#39;t keep me from their chili cheese fries or dining in one night.

This is worth getting.  It&#39;s pretty much unadultered, simply roasted and served with apples, pears, potatoes, kale and a duck jus.  The pork shoulder was super tender and juicy and paired with creamy fregola (think big cous cous) and kale - YUM!  Spaghetti carbonara with duck egg was agreeably rich and smoky.Desserts were strong.  The sticky toffee cake is a real winner.  Warm cake with decadent smoky toffee sauce - WOW!

We made an 8 pm reservation for three people and when we arrived waited at the desk for quite a while .  When the hostess did finally arrive she said we could have a table inside or a high top bar table outside.  We were deciding when she just left and took a party of 5 or 6 people to their table.  When she came back we opted for the inside table and were told that it was not available? Apparently a larger party was more important.   Were were told to wait at the bar (where the music  is so loud you cannot talk to the person you are sitting next to) and a table would be ready in 15 min.  No further communication for 20 minutes and as we were just about to walk out, offered a table outside. The patio has great atmosphere, a nice vibe and just the right amount of background music so we thought things were looking up.   We sat there for a full 10 minutes before being offered water, asked about food or a drink. We ordered a salad, the duck and short ribs.  The salad took almost 30 min to come and the entrees another 20 minutes after that.  Several tables around us were seated, fed and left before we received our food.  We got plates to share our salad and were not given clean plates to share the duck.   And the plate my husband used to eat his salad, was not cleared when he received his entree. I understand this is not &#39;fine&#34; dining but really...  Dirty plates on the table during dinner.  The wait staff was apologetic and they did buy us an order of cheese curds but it was halfway through our dinner?  On to the food.  The short ribs were delicious and well done.  The salad was also excellent but the duck (their signature dish) was awful.  It came almost cold, the legs and thighs were good but the remainder of the meat was grissly and tough.  We brought it home for our dogs.  Overall our experience was disappointing.  We will not be back and will not recommend it.

The bar area is really retro cool, and then the back dining area is sort of retro rustic. The staff was all hands on deck.

I tried the Autumn Kaleidoscope. That&#39;s a show stopper! Its one of those drinks that&#39;s served with smoke and it smells fantastic if you enjoy fall smells. My boyfriend had The Don which was super strong. You get your money&#39;s worth! I also tried a Drunk A L&#39;Orange which I thought was refreshing. It had a whiff of licorice to it which turned my boyfriend off.For food we started with cheese curds, and the rice cake fingers. Both were amazing cocktail snacks. I loved the mix of flavors in both dishes. They both had a slight spice but nothing crazy. I liked the texture of the rice cake fingers. They&#39;re crunchy on the outside and chewy inside, but in a good way, like a well cooked pasta.My boyfriend couldn&#39;t pass up the carbonara for his main. He was in love with it! He said the bacon was some of the best that he&#39;s ever had. I had the striped bass which was also amazing. It was perfectly cooked with a nice crunch on the skin. A beautiful dish.For dessert we tried the chocolate beignets with peanut butter ice cream. I loved it but my boyfriend thought the beignet was just ok. I think he wanted it to be like a sweet cake but this was more bread-like. I ate his portion. While we were there we were eyeing everything that went by.

As someone who loves to explore new neighborhoods, I was taken with The Duck Inn&#39;s origin story, a successful chef&#39;s return to his working-class roots. And I loved the sound of a menu inspired by the diversity of the neighborhood itself! Despite my high expectations, The Duck Inn managed to impress; splitting dishes with three friends, I don&#39;t think we ordered a single dud. We were all blown away by the roasted mushrooms on the creamiest of polentas, topped with green garlic and porcini-dusted popcorn; we weren&#39;t even embarrassed to scrape the bowl for the last drop. We were equally enamored by the prawns on a sea of risotto, smooth and rich with uni butter.You can also order bar snacks from the dining room--an absolute must for even the most refined visitor.

All of them were delicious! The cheese curds were great (highly recommend) and my favorite dish was the Berkshire Pork Shoulder (EXTREMELY recommend). It was a mouth watering bite every time!! We were talking about this dish the whole drive home.What took my visit from a 4 star to a 5 star was the service. As each plate came out, a gentleman (different from our waitress) delivered the dish to the table and gave a nice description of exactly what was on the plate... Although I had no idea what some of the things he was saying were, I enjoyed the rundown. (It was a quiet night so I&#39;m not sure if they have someone do that normally or not)Our evening ended with that same gentleman coming over to our table to ask how our meal was and to make sure we were satisfied.

the-duck-inn-chicago,Julio P.,UBkw2O6uKPLyCNfHwLPMyg,OKO3y5gssnHamHKPiOrYwQ,"Dined 10/18/15Tiny little corner building, hiding a true gem in an area that borders Bridgeport and Pilsen. Step inside and it looks like a throwback to the late 60&#39;s, filled with starburst chandeliers and plenty of kitchy mod furniture. It reeks of nostalgia and that&#39;s a smell I love to take in. We walked in on a Sunday evening. Not super busy but a few people enjoying themselves. Chef Kevin Hickey put together a nice menu of reasonably priced, well put together entrees and a spin on classic southside Chicago fare (think hotdogs and tamales, with a dash of Chinatown mixed in for good measure). His great grandmother used to own this building as a packaged goods bar and some of the menu nods to her Lithiuanian roots. We started with their take on cheese curds, battered in a tempura batter, nice texture and squeaky (I love when cheese curds are still squeaky), served with bloody mary ketchup, that could have been spicier to my liking, and a ribbon of hoppy mayo, hop infused mayo that def had that bitterness present. For entree, we split their Rotisserie duck presentation. Came out on a lovely wood board, cut up and ready to eat. Really gorgeous.Underneath the very crispy and well seasoned duck was a mix of wilted swiss chard, roasted potatoes and apples, tossed in a gooseberry vinaigrette. This salad mix was so good, I almost finished my date&#39;s half, especially with the lovely duck drippings all over it. Really well presented and prepared, a perfect split for two. They have an extensive beer and wine selection. We sat at the bar and our bartender gave us samples of the draft beers to make our selection. I did hefeweiszen and a sour, as well as a pumpkin lambic that was appropriately sweet and not too &#34;spicy&#34;. Service was absolutely amazing. Our bartender was really cool, great conversationalist and we talked shop for quite a bit. The manager, JJ Schiappa, was really cool with us as well, visited us to initially let us know, after we ordered, that the duck dinner was not included in the industry night special. However, since we weren&#39;t informed when we ordered, he gave us the discount anyway (Please don&#39;t go in there demanding the same discount, though; that&#39;s rude.). He really didn&#39;t have to, I would have happily paid full price for a really great dinner and drinks, plus service. He also sent us a chocolate beignet dessert on the house. It came with a roasted banana anglaise and peanut butter ice cream. So. Stupid. Good.  Rockit Ranch spots usually have a rep for being douchebag gathering places, but this place was miles away from that type of ambiance. Lots of neighborhood regulars. Def check it out, especially on a Sunday for you industry folks. (Don&#39;t go saying you&#39;re industry when you&#39;re not though; also rude.)",349,5,3,5,51,9.3975,5.529,1.651,22.819,No
the-duck-inn-chicago,Matt H.,7j0n97kCjVrbW41MbFDXWg,L6cYFEtsEfkRoF5VVchEuw,"After driving through industrial areas, you arrive at The Duck Inn. A truly unique and fun place. A couple of weekends ago, I was part of a group of six people and we were seated at a table in the bar area. This area of the restaurant is quite boisterous. Luckily, we were all in a festive mood and didn&#39;t mind it. For starters, we ordered one rotisserie duck, roasted mushrooms, fried cheese curds, and duck fat dog. This place doesn&#39;t mess around with duck! So wonderfully memorable! The mushrooms with farro were spectacular and I don&#39;t even really care for them in general! Duck fat dog and fried cheese curds were also both satisfying. I should mention that the drink service was very slow; our beverages arrived after our appetizers! A couple of us ordered the Hackney Handshake cocktail. Plenty of compliments were uttered. However, we did conclude that the individual prices of all our drinks were obnoxious. You&#39;ve been warned. Entrees that were ordered included the Shortrib, Gyros and Scallop &amp; Clam Stew. I had the Shortrib which I highly recommend. Incredible flavor and nice tenderness. It came on top of a string bean ragu and charred onions. Yum! Mixed reviews on the Gyros; those who ordered it said it was not really what they were expecting. It was basically a Lamb Chop. High marks for the Scallop &amp; Clam Stew. The peanut butter and chocolate ice cream was a pleasant way to end the meal. Other standouts for dessert were the beignets and the sticky toffee pudding. Our waiter was initially standoffish with us as we began our dining experience but warmed to us over the course of the night. I have never been a waiter before, but shouldn&#39;t he/she be warm and welcoming right from the start? We had zero attitude going into the meal so we found it quite puzzling. All in all, The Duck Inn is worth a trip. I noticed that the restaurant has an outdoor patio. I really would like to return in the summer months and experience that. A Saturday lunch perhaps? The weather in Chicago this past month almost seemed to indicate that winter was coming in a few weeks. Hopefully, May will actually start the warming trend! xoxo",248,4,2,5,38,6.5821,6.192,0.984,27.823999999999995,No

I&#39;ve live in the hood for 6 years  prior to moving out the the burbs and my landlord recommended this place to me a year ago. Let me say, this is a gem in the rough and a great addition to the Bridgeport area after Nana.The food is great, service is very good and ambiance is not bad.Ambiance:- 4 out of 5When you first enter the establishment, it looked more like an old school bar setting. The restaurant part  design and fixtures were unique and contemporary, but the smaller space makes you feels a bit cramped. But lighting level is very nice not too bright but not dark enough to have you take your phone out to read the menu, Noise level is a bit high due to the tight spotService:- 5 out of 5Our waiteress was nice and very helpful she explained the menu and knew that we were there to try the start of the night the Duck. Also, manager helps out and were very nice and attentive to our needs.Food:- 5 out of 5This is the true start of the night. We started with appetizer which is like a spring roll type wrapped which was delicious and flavorful. The dipping sauce was spot on. Then comes the delicious duck. The duck came with the breast and quarters. Very well roasted and crispy but moise and tender inside. It was cooked to perfection. The citrus sauce was can be improve as it was a bit bland. This is probably the best duck we had in Chicago thus far!. The salad that came with it was tasty and I love the potatoes. The duck and salad was just enough for 2 person.Bottomline:-I would probably will defintely be back and strongly recommends anyone who wish to have duck to this restaurant. It&#39;s the best duck restaurant in town. Kudos to the owner.DMAN",201,5,2,5,40,10.035900000000002,5.138,0.042,17.820999999999998,No
the-duck-inn-chicago,Jay N.,6_P0geYrj0BieGTdnvkCaw,_UEF4OiuqR2pls6n0787OA,"We had driven by here on our way to another event and decided to have dinner here based on good reviews.  Street parking is pretty easy around there so it&#39;s not as inconvenient as another place we were trying to get into.  We were welcomed cordially at front and were seated away from the bar into another room.  It is much quieter here compared to the turntable music which I would probably appreciate if it was just for drinks.Our server welcomed us and gave us some recommendations and her favorites along with the popular items.  We were interested in the fries but she said it was in rice oil as we were looking for duck fat fries.  The duck wings were meaty but overcooked as it was quite stringy.  The sauce was also quite sweet.  The shrimp and duck lumpia came in 4 diagonal cut half pieces and had plenty of shrimp but was lacking in duck and the sauce seemed very conventional as a sweet chili sauce.  For some larger dishes we went with the pasta carbonara, mushrooms, and prawns with risotto.  Maybe we picked a bad combination but they were ultimately all similar: very creamy carb dish with a side of protein.  The spaghetti in the carbonara were clinging to each other since they were slightly undercooked while the uni butter dominated the risotto.  Normally, this wouldn&#39;t be bad as I really like uni, but it came off quite unbalanced compared to the prawns.  The mushroom was the best of them all with different textures including the popcorn.  I enjoyed my draft porter but for $8, it was not even 8 ounces with the large head.  Overall, the service was pleasant and attentive but it&#39;d be hard for me to return when there are a lot of options out there.",169,3,2,5,24,5.2679,2.3080000000000003,0.22,13.472000000000001,No

The duck wings had just the right balance of sweet to spicy. They were tender and addictive. The soft shell crab special was fresh and delcious. And the duck was perfection. It was moist and flavorful, served with beautifully crisped potatoes, pickled strawberries, and greens. Amazing! And the meal was wonderful paired with a bottle of grenache from Buil i Gine that was served at the perfect temperature.Dessert was sticky toffee pudding and two refreshing cocktails that Brandon made for us (we gave some parameters and asked for something off menu).

I was here last Friday night and sat at the bar with two friends. Derby still had their happy hour specials so we ordered a round of $2 Lagunitas Pilsners (a helluva good deal!) and perused the appetizer&#39;s menu as their apps were all still half price. I generally go for the sliders or wings as they&#39;re pretty solid and you can&#39;t beat the price. I&#39;ve also had the nachos before and they&#39;re good too. The bar staff are helpful, friendly, and we even enlisted two of them to help my friend decide whether to get his girlfriend flowers for her birthday when she had already received numerous bouquets from other friends and family members.

I was still working on my sliders and the bus boy decided I was done with meal and tried to take the plate away.

He did the same thing with a water glass too. I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s overzealous or if Derby has a policy where you can only use glassware for a specified amount of time.

derby-chicago,Anthony M.,CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw,YV8SdwLtAs5Z1cxPbkftSA,"BURGER BINGE WEEKYelp and several Chicago locations were holding a Burger week that included $5 burgers with a Yelp Check in. The Derby was one of those locations offering the special. The promotion was great because it made me want to go out and try new places and the Derby made my list. When you walk in you first will notice that the bar is really beautiful. The bartender also greeted me immediately. That is great customer service.  Across from the bar is a line of comfy booths that are built up a little higher. I like this personal touch because it gets you off the floor and your table above the &#34;ass line&#34;. Don&#39;t look up that word cause I&#39;m sure I just made it up. The &#34;ass line&#34; is the area in a crowded bar where your face and food meet the ass of a complete stranger. I hate those places. So don&#39;t worry The Derby Booths are above that line. That&#39;s 5 stars alone!Our waitress Rebecca was really nice. She made sure we all checked in on Yelp before she gave us out deal. She was funny as I tried to secure a strong enough signal to actually check in. Those Metal Ceilings in bars can make cell phone coverage hard. She was just about to let me go then I finally got checked in. There was a countdown that informed me I had 4 hours to use the deal. I felt like Jack Bauer in 24 but I knew I wasn&#39;t going to need that much time to enjoy the burger here. So I put my order in for the Derby Burger. Which is a Hand crafted chorizo/beef blend patty that is then topped with pepper jack cheese, pulled house smoked Carolina BBQ pork, bacon, coleslaw and onion strings on a pretzel bun. I also suggest a fork lift because your gonna need that to get it into your mouth. Normally the burger is $12. It also comes with a choice of side. I went tater tots and the rest of my group went Mac&#39;nCheese. The tots were fantastic and perfectly cooked with a nice crunch. But I did hear some big time compliments for the Mac&#39;nCheese from my table. So next time I&#39;m going there. Now on to the burger. I actually ordered it Medium which was cooked perfect. I am normally a medium rare guy but raw chorizo worried me. I could hardly taste any difference in the meat meaning the chorizo did not over power the beef but complimented the meat mixture. I really liked that. The toppings were fantastic too. I also forgot to mention they threw on lettuce, tomato and red onion. Yeah I really needed that fork lift and possibly a crane to lift the burger. I decided there was no wrong way and I grabbed the burger by both hands and dived it.  All I can say is Wow! All of the toppings blended into this perfect flavor explosion. I was also amazed at how well the bun held everything in. I only had a few pieces of pulled pork fall out and that was it. 5 stars to the chef for building this beauty of a burger. There were also drink specials too on a Tuesday. Corona in a bottle was $3. So I decided to grab a few of those. I love beer specials in a bar because it just makes me feel good. Beer is good but beer on sale just tastes better. There was also a giant margarita special for $8 with a Corona tipped in it. Those are the latest craze. Rebecca our waitress was really good. She knew the menu and kept our table full of drinks and food. I also met the GM and he was a nice guy. We talked about the room next door. There was a guy playing acoustic music but I could only see him &amp; not hear him. I loved that the rooms were sound proof from each other. On a side note there&#39;s acoustic music here on Tuesday night. Our side of the bar had regular music on and plenty of games on the air. The poor Blackhawks did not fair that well tonight. The high altitude of Colorado is no place to skate competitively. This place was great because of the amazing food, fun staff, comfy booths and quantity of TVs on the wall. I would come back to hang and eat. The bar is located near DePaul but it wasn&#39;t packed with college students. It seemed more classier then a college bar and looked nicer. So I am glad Yelp ran a Burger Week Special because if they hadn&#39;t I would have never found The Derby.",468,5,1,5,-27,13.9768,10.403000000000002,3.257,51.34000000000001,No

Derby is a Mizzou bar, and most of this group had attended Mizzou. As there was a Mizzou game on, the place was packed. We were able to get a table which was great. They had $4 beers and $5 appetizers as well as a raffle. They also gave out t-shirts to people who got there early. All of the waitstaff were in costumes for Halloween which actually worked out well because otherwise I would have had no idea who our waittress was. We had some appetizers and beers before the game started. I had some boneless buffalo wings and some pretzels. Both were very good. I really like their buffalo sauce. The Mizzou game looked like it was going to be over by the end of the 1st half, but Mizzou failed to put the game away and lost a heartbreaker in double overtime with a missed field goal that went off the upright. As I am not much of a Mizzou fan, I was unphased. Everyone else was pissed, and the whole bar cleared out within 30 minutes of the end of the game.

The first two times were fine - food was decent (although hush puppies were not fully done inside) and service was fine. HOWEVER...after my most recent trip, I will not be returning.We arrived on a Sunday night (~8pm, restaurant mostly empty) and found a table on the patio. It took our waitress about five minutes to come over with menus. She was nice enough. I think. I&#39;m not really sure because she NEVER CAME BACK to our table.We waited for about 15-20 minutes without seeing her. I understand that things happen...maybe she got caught up at another table or something. Family emergency?? I didn&#39;t know. Finally, about 20-25 minutes into our visit, we saw her bring a tray of shots out to another table, also seated on the patio. She then began chatting with the people at the table. Which normally is totally cool, but not when other customers have been waiting, water and food-less, for 25 minutes.We decided to leave when, after she chatted with the other table for a few minutes, and we thought she might actually come serve us, she ran back into the restaurant and brought out her cell phone. She then began showing these people photos on her phone. I heard her say &#34;look at these pictures of my ex&#39;s cat.&#34;I have never before walked out of a restaurant like I did that night.

That being said, this place never really falls short on any aspect of a bar in general otherwise I would be going to another Mizzou bar or staying at home. Food is fantastic. Kentucky hot browns and chorizo burgers make this place&#39;s food rank up there with places that will charge you much more for something similar. And it&#39;s out in a hurry, never had a long wait for food no matter how crowded it is.Interior is new, with lofted booths that put your table higher so you can not only see one of the MANY TVs that show the game you came to watch, but also elevate your food above everyone&#39;s waist-line for when it gets crowded. They even have a nice fenced in patio that&#39;s great for outdoor dining/drinks when the weather is warm. Or if the weather is not so warm, it&#39;s covered with a tent and strewn with heat lamps to help keep the place roomy and warm. During mizzou game days they decorate the place with Mizzou paraphernalia and gear that really makes you feel like you&#39;re at a watch party instead of just watching a game at any bar. Staff: cannot stress this enough. Always friendly, helpful, and polite, no matter how crowded it gets or how rowdy (inebriated) people get. It doesn&#39;t feel like your typical waitstaff, they&#39;re approachable and helpful. You know, people. Bartenders are friendly and welcoming. They&#39;ve even welcomed us when we walked in a few weeks ago, just to be friendly to Mizzou patrons who they know are a big part of their success. Hell, even the bouncers are friendly and helpful, and remember when you go outside or leave and come back. I can&#39;t remember ever saying a bouncer was welcoming before.To top it off, the drink specials are great. Consistent beer prices and specials let me rest easy and not have to think about my order. So in short, I think this bar checks all the boxes, and leaves me wanting none.",242,5,1,5,-15,7.0463000000000005,4.669,0.775,15.556000000000001,No

This place is connected to the Aloft hotel but it didn&#39;t seem like a hotel restaurant.Parking: parking is difficult in this area, street parking is possible but hard. Walking or taking public transportation is the best way of getting here.Ambience/Space: the restaurant was crowded when I went on a Friday afternoon around lunch. It seemed small but only because the restaurant was packed with Cubs fans who were hungry after the parade. The restaurant has a hipster vibe, laid back and chill. The menu was hipster too with its healthy menu options but delicious and filling.

Other restaurants in the area told us it was a 45 min to an hour wait so it was nice not having to wait long for a table.

The menu is very limited  with only 14 items and they list the food from light to filling, starting from the top to the bottom. The menu had some interesting choices like chocolate glazed salmon and turkey neatloaf. My dad isn&#39;t very hipster haha so he kept it traditional and ordered the Prime Burger.

beatrix-river-north-chicago,Bailey M.,k97c4eriYUeMG_cGw8rYLQ,jjv2LTzjWG4tMPUXpNjClA,"SO GOOD!What I love about their menu is that a lot of their dishes are healthy! I have to admit as a picky eater some of the dishes do not sound appealing to me, but every time I try a new dish, I surprisingly like it! So bonus points for having a unique healthy menu offering. I have had the roast beef egg sandwich. It was good but a little too big to eat. I ended up taking the egg off because it was just too much. Given that, the flavor profiles were still great. I had the enlighten caesar salad. I normally never feel full after eating a salad anywhere, but it was so good and filling! I asked if they could use darker lettuce and they mixed the lettuce for me, which was very nice of them. The portion size was huge and I ate the whole thing! I added chicken to the salad which I would highly recommend, especially if you are feeling hungry. I tried some of my friend&#39;s enchiladas, which sounded gross to me because I have never had enchiladas made of kale and eggs, but oh my gosh, they were amazing! That is the next dish I will be ordering. Last, but not least, is their amazing pastry selection. Everything looks so visually appealing and delicious. Everyone raves about their cinnamon roles which I haven&#39;t tried yet. I had just a basic chocolate chip cookie, but it was probably one of the best cookies I have ever had. I like all the unique options they have as well, such as a s&#39;mores cookie or angel food cake. Tip: sign up for their email club for a free pastry!",168,5,3,5,68,10.2264,5.533000000000002,0.061,15.406000000000002,No

We came in for brunch on a Sunday afternoon, I recommend making a reservation as it was pretty busy. Ambiance: Very chill casual environment. Ample space where you&#39;re not super close to other tables and music not too loud where you can hear one another. Being that it&#39;s River North you had people that were dressed up, but also people that were casually dressed with gym shoes (not completely grunged down or like they just came from the gym, but comfortable). Food: I ordered the blue mimosa, quinoa cakes with poached eggs, caramel pie and kennebec fries. The blue mimosa was interesting, it was freshly squeezed blueberry juice with champagne. I&#39;ve only ever had citrusy flavored beverages for mimosas so it was definitely something different, in regardless good. The quinoa cakes were really delicious! The tomato-basil sauce tasted like it was marinara sauce, couldn&#39;t really taste the basil, none the less good a good pairing with the cakes and eggs. Ordered the kennebec fries as a side to share for the table. They were pretty crispy and a big helping, between the three of us we didn&#39;t finish it. It comes with what tasted like a mayo based sauce that had a lemon zing to it. There were also what appeared to look like deep fried lemon slices and bell peppers. It was interesting, but good. Lastly, ordered the caramel pie. It came highly recommended by my roommate, she was raving about it and I have to say she was right. SO GOOD! Perfectly sized and can be good for sharing or for one person. It came with a vanilla bean tasting whipped cream. The crust was perfect, had a crunch to it and stayed in tact when you were cutting pieces out of the pie slice. The pie itself tasted like those Werther&#39;s original flavored candies (caramel candies wrapped in bright gold wrappers), but BETTER! It was like a salted caramel pie. So yummy HAVE TO GET IT. I didn&#39;t see it on the brunch menu, but asked and they&#39;ll still serve it. Service: Our server was very attentive and despite being super busy (we went at a peak time for brunch) the food came out really fast.

I just had wine, but my roommate tried both the Pineapple Habanero and the Goji Berry Blossom. The Pineapple Habanero was complex and full bodied while the Goji Berry Blossom was sweet and a little underwhelming. Daily Special; Crab Cake: The cake itself was more meat than breading and it was served with greens, avocado, and a tomato/corn salad. The salads actually held their own in terms of flavor, and weren&#39;t there just to add color to the plate. Chicken Bebe: So rich. I had a brief photo shoot with our entrees when they came out (lol), and I could smell the parmesan even from a distance. It was also surprisingly filling.

He gets Customer Service!

Fun, delicious, healthy, exciting innovative and reasonably priced. I&#39;d describe it as a fresh innovative, healthy take on comfort food.

The Spicy Chicken Tinga and side of Slider looking Chicken Sausages were fabulous. Oh and if you&#39;re going to go down in flames and have dessert, the Sea Salt Carmel Pie is insane as is the Black Chocolate Truffle Pie. One tip for the restaurant:  The menu doesn&#39;t tell you how many pieces of Deviled Eggs are in an order. It would be nice if we could order the Deviled Eggs by the piece, or state The number of eggs per plate (3) on the menu and perhaps offer an upcharge option for an addition egg.

Perfect. Snacks we ordered were the tsukune (chicken meatballs), burrata and crispy kale salad.

When we arrived people were lined up at the door.  This influx of people didn&#39;t keep Beatrix from promptly seating us at our reservation time.  We were seated at a table that offered a big comfy couch as part of the seating.  It was very cozy and comfy.  The restaurant is huge and because of the crowds it was noisy but it was a very energetic noise that somehow felt right with the atmosphere.  They also played a lot of awesome music in the background so my boyfriend and I were singing along a lot.The menu itself was overwhelming.  I wanted so many things!  I decided to go with the Ginger Sangria made with their housemade natural juice. My boyfriend did the same with a blueberry juice with gin.  Both of our drinks were delicious!  They were so refreshing and tasty!  The fresh fruit in the drinks made them all the more appealing!  As good as the drinks were, dare I say that the food was even more delicious?  I had the eggs, cauliflower grits and brussel sprouts and I can&#39;t stop thinking about them!  They were the perfect consistency and were popping with flavor - I want to go back and get them now even as I&#39;m writing this.To top it all off, we had excellent service from a young lady who was very enthusiastic and efficient.  We left Beatrix feeling like we won the lottery.  Beatrix, please come to Columbus, Ohio and open a restaurant.  Love, Erica R.",197,5,3,5,59,9.9473,5.59,0.12,20.29,No

I went here for Sunday brunch about a month and a half ago, with my husband, our daughter, his best friend, wife and their 18 month old son. What I loved:1. Great vibe2. Stellar service3. Amazing menu, which is why I need to go back.  SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM!4. Fair pricesWhat I didn&#39;t love, and why it&#39;s not getting the 5 stars that other patrons have given Beatrix:1. Super packed.  I really felt like I couldn&#39;t even back my chair up when I had to excuse myself from the table because the table behind me and beside me was so close.2. Not exactly kid friendly, something that has become really important since having a baby 9 months ago.I had the Mushroom Quinoa burger: with swiss cheese, baby kale, kennebec fries and a sriracha aioli.  I love mushrooms and I love quinoa, so I had high expectations and this burger didn&#39;t disappoint at all.  My husband who hates anything healthy took a bite of my burger and even he was blown away.  Now, doesn&#39;t that say something?   The burger was homemade, flavorful and would be worthy competition for even the best non-veg burger.  You can hold me to it.For my drink, I chose the Power Greens Smoothie: kale, romaine, celery, pineapple and a hint of mint.  This drink had serious pizzazz!  It was light, refreshing and definitely helped me start my day on the right foot! My husband ordered the Green Chili Enchiladas with scrambled eggs.  roasted poblano peppers, baby kale, chihuahua cheese and pepperjack.  He really liked his choice and thought the baby kale was an unexpected but pleasant addition to one of his favorite breakfast items.

If I&#39;m feeling like I want to eat a bit lighter, I go for the Supernatural chopped salad or one of the daily vegetarian specials; if I&#39;m feeling naughty, I go for the pot roast sandwich. Point being, anyone can find something to eat here.And speaking of their vegetarian specials: they&#39;re always pretty great. And while I&#39;m by no means a vegetarian, more often than not, I&#39;m pleased at what they come up with. My favorites include the mushroom braise over cauliflower puree, zucchini papardelle with roasted tomatoes and mozzarella, cauliflower milanese, or the grilled cheese covered in crispy parmesan. They&#39;re all so satisfying that you definitely won&#39;t miss the meat.Their mocktails are all really good too. They&#39;re a bit pricey but I can never resist getting one. The hard part is choosing which one. The cherry-chia and blueberry-basil are so fresh, and taste exactly like pureed fruit. They don&#39;t use any fillers.

Yelp said that the restaurant closed at 9pm but Google said that it was open till midnight. Since it was after 10pm, my friend decided to call Beatrix to see if they were still open and if they were serving coffee and pastries. The man who answered the phone said that they stopped serving food at 9pm but that they were still open and he would turn the coffee on for us :). We were only a couple minutes away from Beatrix and when we got there, we asked the host (Chad, the manager), if they were still serving coffee. He remembered and asked if we had just called; he said that he turned the coffee (Espresso machine) on for us. So nice of him! My friend also told me about the yummy gluten free pastries that they have there but all of their pastries were put away for the evening. We were hoping that there might be some gluten free pastries left and when we asked Chad, he said, &#34;Let me see what I have.&#34; He checked and they had coconut macaroons and double chocolate chip cookies left. I chose the coconut macaroon with a strawberry or raspberry jam center. IT was delicious and satisfied my sweet craving for the evening!

I&#39;m the biggest turkey bacon hater, but some how Beatrix manages to make theirs great!! I also enjoy their 10 grain oatmeal. It&#39;s oatmeal with a fun added flare of other grains and a yummy cherry topping. At dinner I also love the turkey neatloaf. Turkey, kale, and sweet potatoes all combined into meatloaf goodness.

However, I like their brunch. The portions are on the smaller size and maybe a little more expensive than elsewhere, but the food is also light and the drink menu is good. Definitely try the spicy chicken tinga for brunch. The service: 4/5. We&#39;ve had a fairly good luck with the servers so far.

Beatrix has figured out the formula to be chill and lively.Now to the food. I had the Skirt Steak Chimichurri. My wife had the Eggplant Paperdelle Ragu (she&#39;s a wanna be vegetarian) and the kids had the burgers. Let&#39;s start with the burgers. The burger blend was amazing. As an &#34;adult&#34;, I would be thrilled to have the kid&#39;s burger as my entree. My wife&#39;s dish was magnificent.  I am a carnivore and for me to say a vegetarian dish is something I would order is on the order of you spotting a unicorn.  My skirt steak was done to perfection and the Chimichurri was an amazing addition.

One of my friends has been raving about Beatrix for years and I randomly decided to check it out on Saturday night. I don&#39;t often give 5/5 but Beatrix deserves it ( service was mediocre, idk what has been going on with lettuce entertain you service lately but they really need to re-assess their training booklet and training staff. But seriously the food was so good I will overlook the service or lack thereof for a brief moment)We arrived about 15 min early and the restaurant was packed so we decided to grab a drink at the bar (cue the bad service) we waited a good 7 minutes before the bartender even looked our way (bar was not crowded we grabbed a seat). My friend and I ordered a Gogi Berry Blossom and a Blueberry Tom Collins, both were amazing. We waited about another 5 min and our table was ready but still no drinks. Finally a few minutes later our drinks came and WOW! Amazing cocktails. We were seated and (sorry- cue the bad service) we waited quite a few minutes before our waiter came by. When he finally came by he dropped off the specialist menu but by that point we were ready to order. We ordered appetizers of the Burrata, Tuna Crudo, Kale Salad and for our entr’©e we got the skirt steak.                            The Ahi Tuna Crudo and Burrata came out first; both 5/5. The ahi tuna was so fresh a great portion size (since we ordered a lot) and amazing flavor combo.  The burrata- WOW, a litter firmer then what I am used to but still great! It was paired with what I thought was guac but it was actually mashed edamame and artichoke ( YUM!) and some kind of yummy healthy crispy cracker.  Next came our salad, they waiter had split the salad for us which was super nice. I&#39;m a total salad snob, salad is hands down my favorite food and this crispy kale salad may be the top 2 best salads I have ever eaten. The salad had papaya, pumpkin seeds, dates, parmesan (not over powering) with a white balsamic vinaigrette. The waiter finally decided to make his rounds by this point to check in on us and we ordered another round of drinks, this time 2 orders of Gogi Berry Blossom (sigh- it literally felt like we waited 30 minutes for these cocktails). By this point our entr’©e arrived- Skirt Steak Chimichurri. The steak was cooked and sliced perfectly. We were actually pretty full at this point but continued to nibble away. The steak came with fries and grilled peppers. By this point we were so full we had no room to have dessert.I really enjoyed the atmosphere, it was very different from everything else in the River North area. The environment was very pleasant and not stuck up at all (breathe of fresh air). It was a nice restaurant but felt fairly casual. I would highly recommend everything that I ordered, although everything looked phenomenal on the menu.

Looking around people had sandwiches and salads all around so lots of healthier options available. I however, decided to carry out two pieces of their much talked about Carmel pie. It took like 5 minutes and my pies were ready, served in perfect little to go boxes with silver wear and everything, they get a star alone for that. When I got home I indulged and it was fantastic. Creamy, rich, carmel flavor, not overly sweet with fantastic homemade whipped cream on the side. What&#39;s not to love.

Well, fast-forward about fifteen minutes later, and still no dinner!  I wasn&#39;t paying attention to the time, but our dinner took long enough that my friend and I both noticed and commented on it--probably around a half hour between ordering and receiving our food.  When it did come, it was delicious--I really enjoyed the Escarole &amp; Potato Ravlioli.  I also had the Mango, Orange, &amp; Pineapple Nectar to drink, and although it was tasty, I don&#39;t think I could justify ordering it for $6.50 again.The ambiance was fine but did feel a bit hotel lobby-ish, probably because we were at one of the tables in the section that opens to the lobby.

I&#39;m not referring to the decor, which is attractive. Or the food, which is good (but not great). My issue is with the service, which is beyond rushed.First, about the food. My friend had the Kale salad, which looked like hedge clippings to me, but she liked it. Maybe a rabbit could fill up on it, but not the &#34;stairmaster queen.&#34; So she asked for bread or a roll, but the only thing they could come up with was a side of toast for $3.50. I ordered the pot roast sandwich. After one look I was pretty sure I&#39;d be taking half home, but after one bite I knew I was wrong. It was yummy, but there was only about four ounces of meat. Perhaps a bit skimpy for $14? They were much more generous with the fries, but when I blow it, it&#39;s not on fries.Which meant... room for desert.  We split the warm apple strudel with whipped cream. Divine and worth every calorie. If you like apples, you will love this!  The coffee was good, too, but we were never offered a refill. Now, about the service. We each ordered a glass of wine, and I&#39;d asked our friendly server not to rush the meal.  But after just a few sips of wine, the food arrived. My friend had just gotten back from a long trip, and I was looking forward to hearing about her adventures. Because she was doing most of the talking, I finished my meal before she did. Without asking, the busser took my plate away, even though my friend was only halfway through her kale. I saw this happening at other tables, too.Note to Beatrix management: unless you&#39;re running a buffet, it&#39;s considered rude to clear the table until everyone has finished. When you do, those who eat fast feel awkward, and those who eat slowly feel pressured to eat faster and finish.  What&#39;s more, our server didn&#39;t even wait until my friend was done before she offered us coffee and dessert. And of course the check arrived before we asked for it. Who trained the people who work here anyway? The answer is management whose goal is to push as many people through as possible in the shortest amount of time. Maybe this is only an issue at lunch and not dinner.

beatrix-river-north-chicago,Travis N.,bxJE4ug_HwJA9r9wcm2yQg,USjIeIyJ1PYDfqkGRUqbHg,"Before I write my review I am going to need to define a term that I am going to end up using relatively heavily, and that term is &#34;hella&#34;. The heavy usage of the word &#34;hella&#34; signifies that I am from Northern California, and it basically means &#34;extremely&#34; or a &#34;large amount/quantity&#34; of something. Now that the definition is out of the way, let&#39;s dive right in.My coworker and I were staying at Aloft for a conference (I&#39;ll review Aloft equally high, but in a separate review), and part of our &#34;planning&#34; for our days included our nightly brainstorming sessions at the smaller bar. The idea is that one beer starts the creativity process, two beers is ideal to maximize the creativity, but you only get between 30-40 minutes after your second beer to make use of that creativity because after that time limit your creativity basically nosedives faster than a North Korean missile test.The ultimate test of a good place is to answer the question, &#34;would you come back?&#34; The answer to which is a huge &#34;yes&#34;. All the staff were hella awesome! You hear rumors of what to expect from Chicagoans like bluntness, or being so straight forward to the point of being perceived as rudeness, but those expectations couldn&#39;t have been more wrong! Everyone we met were amazing! Specific staff highlights include: Joel at the bar who gave us some hella good recommendations on places to eat, including Beatrix for breakfast. We took his suggestion of the pot roast breakfast sandwich, which was freaking awesome (seriously, I&#39;d consider coming back just for that sandwich if it weren&#39;t for the close to $2k plane flight). He also suggested the Italian beef sandwich at Portillo&#39;s (reviewed separately)... amazing! He also suggested Lou Malnati&#39;s as where the true Chicagoans go instead of the other place we were going to try... which was also spot on (in fact I&#39;m on the plane back to Cali with half the pizza in my bag so we&#39;ll see how well it travels!). Those suggestions helped make our trip amazing! Plus the Bottom Up Wit by Revolution Brewing was awesome paired with the Kennebec Fries (super good! Who would have known that fried lemon slices would taste so good!)Jen, as our waitress for breakfast, was quick, courteous, welcoming, an awesome conversationalist and pretty much made her way straight to our heart from the start but also got extra brownie points by grabbing us one of Beatrix&#39;s amazing pancakes to try (thanks again Jen!). Seriously, you&#39;ve got to try the pancakes! They aren&#39;t the same consistency that I am used to on the west coast, but it was fantastic. Every time I ran into her after our breakfast she would greet me, ask how things were going, and generally be attentive.In sum, what makes or breaks a good review is contingent on many factors but what you see repeated over and over again in a lot of negative reviews on Yelp is that service plays just as big (if not bigger) part in customer satisfaction. So if you are looking for the full service: an awesome meal, good selection of drinks, great atmosphere, fantastic service, and hella amazing people then look no further than Beatrix because they are the full package!P.S. They got pretty busy during the night, but we sat down right at the bar and just ate there instead of waiting; and if it is busy the night you go and the bar is full or you want the ambiance of a table, then it is totally worth the wait!",395,5,2,5,21,9.4923,4.3660000000000005,0.636,19.998,No

Both my husband and I were thoroughly impressed with the food the kitchen (had to be the A team!) put out.We were seated in the bar area and requested one of the 2-seaters with the plush brown chairs.  Very comfortable.  After googling what it was, we opted for the tsukune (Japanese chicken meatballs) appetizer.  The texture of the meatball was kind of like a fishball, which was surprising to me, but nothing that stood in the way of the dish being quickly demolished. Husband was 100% happy with the pork shank entree: the portion size, the flavor, the speed at which the kitchen sent over our meal.  I was tickled pink with the size of my potato and escarole ravioli.  It was buttery, but not overly so, and you can be sure that ravioli is not store bought when it&#39;s literally the size of your face.  I would highly recommend this entree, and I may or may not have the honor of posting the first pic of the p&amp;e ravioli on Yelp.Another note. If you order the potato and escarole ravioli, make sure you have atleast one of the following:- floss- a mirror- a dining companion who will tell you if/when you have a huge piece of escarole stuck in your teeth (not that I&#39;m speaking from experience...)Totally worth venturing over here!

Looking around, you&#39;re surrounded by lululemon wearing millenials and young families (so much stroller traffic!). I had a reservation for four and we were seated promptly at a spacious table by the window. I would highly recommend making a reservation for brunch, it was packed when we walked in!Concerning the menu, there&#39;s something for everyone here. My vegan mom and gluten-sensitive sister had no trouble finding items. We started with the hummus which was super tasty and came with fresh veggies. For brunch, I went with the quinoa cakes with poached eggs. This dish was fresh tasting and a great-sized portion! The quinoa cakes balanced the tasty tomato sauce and poached eggs really well. Our table also got a side of the homemade chicken sausage which I really enjoyed with the dish. Others in our party got the &#34;wonderful egg white omelet&#34; which was actually wonderful. The tomatoes, avocado, and bacon added tons of texture and flavor. Highly recommend either of these dishes. Our waiter saw us opening presents and asked if we had a birthday. Upon telling him we were celebrating my aunt&#39;s birthday, he brought a piece of (what I think is) the &#34;tall, dark and handsome chocolate cake.&#34; OMG. Addictive. You know when you want to take one bite and one turns into 5?! Yes, this cake will do that to you.Overall, definitely my new favorite brunch spot in River North. Beautifully decorated, fast and friendly service, and tasty food at reasonable portions! That being said, you&#39;re definitely paying River North prices. &#34;Eggs your way&#34; for $10.95, etc. However, this shouldn&#39;t be a surprise given the neighborhood and &#34;fanciness&#34; factor.

It&#39;s a very popular brunch spot and I thought that the brunch was rather spectacular. One trick to get seated faster is ask for outdoors, its first come first serve.

The portion sizes for all 8 of our dishes were quite small. Specifically, I ordered an oatmeal that was so tiny and came with only a sprinkling of toppings that I finished in two minutes. I also ordered a side of raspberry jam toast for $6 and it came with only ONE slice of bread. A side of toast, especially for $6 should be at least two slices. In total, I spent $12 for the oatmeal and slice of bread and was still very hungry after.

chicken-and-farm-shop-chicago,Mike M.,W2zno-nXaGa9Y2Au7L8wNA,3_3y16hl2YFY4JVDnhZ0zg,"As I was browsing through the places on restaurant row looking for some place new to try, I came across the reviews for Chicken Shop. I never really noticed it before and it turns out it&#39;s just steps away from my apartment.Atmosphere: Chicken shop is a little space tucked away in the upstairs part of SoHo/The Allis. It takes on kind of the same vibe with dark, candle-lit lighting and old English wooden decor. It wasn&#39;t packed at all and we were able to get a table immediately. Drinks:Soho mule - Pretty small and tasted almost like pure ginger beer.Mocha milkshake - Wow, this milkshake was amazing. Very strong chocolate and espresso flavors, and had the right level of thickness. We spiked it with Bailey&#39;s, but the alcohol flavor didn&#39;t come through at all, so it wasn&#39;t worth the upcharge. I&#39;d say just enjoy the shake and forget the liquor on this one. Food:Dirty burger of the month The burger was caprese style with arugula, mozz cheese, sliced tomato, and bacon on top. The size of the burger is pretty tiny, and I didn&#39;t really get what made it so special. The &#34;dirty&#34; part of the burger is that they mix bone marrow with the ground meat, but I didn&#39;t really pick up on it at all, through the taste or the texture. Still a decent burger, just nothing unique or special about it. Chicken and wafflesGET THIS. Hands down the best dish of the night. This is the only dish I&#39;ll be ordering here from now on. Usually I&#39;m not even a chicken n waffles fan. Every time I&#39;ve gotten it, they just serve up a piece of fried chicken on top of normal waffle. I usually just end up eating them separately because they don&#39;t really mesh well imo. Here though, the chicken n waffles just seemed to pair seamlessly.The chicken was pretty much perfect. Huge pieces of boneless chicken breast fried up to a crisp. The meat was tender and juicy, and since it was boneless you could cut a perfect blend of chicken and waffle with every bite. The breading was on point, just ultra crispy on the outside with the slightest hint of sweet glaze on the outside. Texture wise it wasn&#39;t overly breaded, so it didn&#39;t taste too greasy or feel too dry. I wish I ordered 2 of these.As for the waffles, they were light and fluffy, and had a nice strong buttery/vanilla flavor to it. I&#39;m usually the guy that pours syrup all over a waffle until each and every square is filled up, but I honestly forgot to even add the syrup on this. It already had the perfect amount of sweetness, and I ate most of it before I even realized they gave us a cup of syrup. Whole rotisserie chicken Meh. I&#39;d say pass on the chicken. It did have a nicely blackened skin and overall had a decent seasoned/lemon flavor. But the meat was a little on the dry side and the skin could&#39;ve been a bit more crisped. I honestly prefer the chicken at Boston Market (maybe I just have cheap taste). I tried to dress it up a little bit with the table sauces, but DAMN that hot sauce is hot and the smokey sauce was a little too tangy for me.Sides:For sides we iniitally awkwardly asked for some dirty ballz, since we saw it on Yelp but didn&#39;t see it on the menu. Luckily our waitress knew what we were talking about and didn&#39;t just think we were a bunch of creepers haha. Apparently it&#39;s no longer on their menu so we just got the Mac n cheese. This is as thick as it gets. Super rich and cheesy, the mac and cheese was just awesome. A little steep for a side dish, but overall delicious. Overall, Chicken and Farm shop was a great find. Although I really only liked 1 out of the 3 things we ordered, that&#39;s pretty much all I need. Now I know where to go when I&#39;m in the mood for some fried chicken and milkshakes.",427,4,2,5,31,11.2292,7.329999999999997,1.5650000000000002,36.104000000000006,No

Everything looks open and like reclaimed tables, even the bar, where I posted up.  The bar backdrop were cubbyholes encasing their liquor selection.  The bartender was in the middle of making a milkshake.  He was still ready to help.  A+ sir.  I ordered a Ginger Brew while looking over the small but perfect menu.  The Ginger Brew had a frothy top, square ice cubes, rye whiskey, house made ginger syrup and pale ale.  It&#39;s decent enough, but a slight bitter taste, I wouldn&#39;t say it was over the top.Started with some dirty balls.  Ha.  Dirty little cheesy balls with chicken and bacon, squishy on the inside and tender but a light crispiness on the outside.  How balls should be.  (think about Pete Schwety here SNL reference).  Chicken and waffles.  Well damn.  I&#39;ve been disappointed thus far on my travels to find the perfect chicken and waffles combo.  No longer my friends.  No longer.  Chicken was heavenly.  Juicy on the inside, and the crispy seasoned coating is something I might imagine snacking on at the movie theater instead of popcorn.  Each bite better than the next, especially with real maple syrup (no pancake syrup Aunt Jemima here), and softened butter to just drip accordingly over the chicken and the waffles, which were fluffy and thick, sweet with a smidgen of powdered sugar.A side (a side??), that is three half pieces of corn on the cob.  Buttered and maybe chives sprinkled for color and taste, lightly charred on the grill.  Fantastic.  This meal is definitely for the fat kid that lives inside of all of us.

Our friends wanted to try it, though, so we went.Soho House is hip and cool and mildly obnoxious--all the things you actually would expect. The four of us, and our 2 babies, took the elevator up to the Chicken &amp; Farm shop. We exited the elevator into what seemed like a service hallway, complete with rubber containers full of dishes. To our right was Chicken &amp; Farm Shop, to the left is their pizza place.C&amp;FS is very small and has a vintage diner vibe. Although it is a really dark space, it&#39;s cute and kitschy. We&#39;d made the right decision by going at 3:00 in the afternoon, as it was pretty empty. We got a big table right away.The menu is pretty limited; there are as many cocktails as food items, I think. We ordered the deviled eggs (pretty good but not the best), the dirty balls (maybe the best item we ordered), chicken &amp; waffles (also pretty good--maybe the star entree), grilled corn with garlic butter (not very flavorful), mac and cheese (also lacking flavor), and the famed rotisserie chicken (disappointingly dry and bland).The things that were good were very good; the things that were bad were very blah. For a late lunch of casual fare for 4--with only one mimosa and no other alcoholic beverages--the total was like $140. That seemed just plain silly.Also, service, while kind, was very inattentive. We had to ask for refills and different things several times before we got them.

This was a follow up visit from the amazing Chicken Sandwich I had at the Taste of Randolph Street festival.D’©cor: Upon entering and climbing the stairs you are met with a small-ish room (for a restaurant) that is decked out to be like a diner crossed with a farm house. There are a bunch of small tables, two counters you can post up to, and lots and lots of chickens haha. Satisfactory light is provided by the wall of windows and the smells emanating from the &#34;kitchen&#34; are deliciously intoxicating.

She was quick to take, and bring, our order and also followed up the perfect amount of times. The cooks did an outstandingly semi-quick job too. Good staff.Food: We had the Chicken and Waffles (SO GOOD, to die for) with a side of Fries (crinkle cut, nothing out of the ordinary) and a side of Mac &#39;n Cheese (pretty pedestrian, but tasty), a Chicken Sandwich (DELICIOUS!), and a Dirty Burger (very, very enjoyable). Finally, for dessert, we had the Apple Pie (average) and a Strawberry Milkshake (made FRESH and tasted out-of-this-world!).

chicken-and-farm-shop-chicago,Lisa H.,DZC-4TrlkvlyhG0VQY8Yfg,QCoiNLmARsrHEyqflanuNw,"Chicken &amp; Farm Shop is located in the famous Soho House.  The restaurant is pretty small, but offers a cozy and rustic vibe.  They are know for their free range chicken on the spit.  You can order it by the piece or opt for the whole bird.  They also offer other entrees if chicken isn&#39;t your thing.I came with a friend for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon.  We ate:Squash, Smoked Butter, and Egg: we didn&#39;t enjoy this at all.  The squash was sweet and soft, just the way I like it.  But the smoked butter was disgusting.  It gave the dish this lingering foul taste in my mouth.  Stay away!Chicken and Waffles: served with syrup and gravy.  The chicken was moist and juicy while the breading was crispy and bursting with flavor.  The waffle was soft while still crispy.  My only gripe with this dish was that it was cold.Chicken Pot Pie: the filling of the pot pie was nothing too special, but the exterior pastry was delicious.  It was made from their biscuits which was fluffy and moist.  The sprinkle of sea salt was a good touch for that extra flavor.  Overall, I don&#39;t understand the hype.  Most of the entrees had good flavor, but it was nothing too great or special.

A friend and I came for lunch on a Tuesday and left very disappointed. All but one dish was surprisingly tasteless.  Started with a side of cornbread and biscuits. The cornbread was just plain blah. A major let down, because I&#39;m a big fan of cornbread and usually order it when it&#39;s on the menu. The biscuits were also a bust. If you&#39;re going to serve biscuits, they better be warm from the oven. These were old and room temperature and chewy.We each had a small bowl of the chicken soup. It was served warm (not hot) and had a nice flavor, but there was at least a tablespoon of oil (chicken fat?) floating on the top.Next we split an order of two fried chicken thighs and a waffle. The thighs were crispy but without a distinct taste, and the waffle was cold. The pat of butter on the waffle never even began to melt. And the last time I drank coffee this bitter, it was from a vending machine at a tollway rest stop. Our server was attentive at first, but we lost track of him after the food was served. We had to flag down another server after waiting ten minutes to pay the check. Not sure why, as the restaurant was less that half filled.Chicken Shop needs an overhaul if it hopes to compete with other comfort food restaurants in Chicago.",154,2,1,1,-31,0.5872999999999997,1.8900000000000001,1.3599999999999999,16.75,No

chicken-and-farm-shop-chicago,Juli A.,p7gazCBItBf5LFjjG1G25w,qX5-I9f4z-pd_uJSWCQOpA,"Seemed pretty straightforward - chicken all carte with a handful of sides.   The chicken is rotisserie, and available in 1/4, 1/2 and whole bird portions.  Our server suggested we order a full bird to shave a few bucks off the tab.  Ordered our sides and added the deviled egg appetizer.  The sides arrived before the deviled eggs - totally ass backwards.  The deviled eggs were pretty good.  The side of fries were cold within minutes, but not greasy, so it wasn&#39;t a total loss.  Two sauces - ketchup and something that was supposed to be garlic aioli - were served along side the fries.  The aioli was neither garlicky nor creamy, with a green hue and a not so subtle flavor of green chili.  Biscuit and corn muffin appetizer was served with a sweet butter, which was really tasty - oddly enough, the server noted that he thought it looked a little gristly but people seemed to like it.  Now about the chicken.  It was served on the bone and was dry as hell.  The skin, which had long since slid off, was slimy and ridiculously over salted.  The breast was cut into three chunks, pretty much guaranteeing that it would be bone dry by the time they reached the table.  Despite the over seasoning of the skin, the meat totally lacked flavor.  I took a thigh, and quickly realized that I was going to have to add one of their signature bottled sauces if there was any chance of eating it.  Both the spicy and the smokey were overpowering.  They would work well on wings, but I&#39;m at a loss to come up with anything else the sauces would complement.  I ended up taking home, and ultimately discarding the rest of my chicken after the alley cats snubbed their noses at it.  Interesting note - my half chicken was missing a leg - not that I would have eaten it, but it was still suspect as hell.About half way through the meal, our server was ready to drop the check on our table - considering how dead the place was, I&#39;m not sure what his hurry was.  We asked to see the menu again to look over the sides one more time and see if any of the deserts looked interesting.  We ordered the lemon meringue, which was applauded by our server.  We paid the check and anxiously awaited the arrival of our pie.  It didn&#39;t arrive.  When I was finally able to attract our server&#39;s attention, it turned out he&#39;d forgotten to put the order in.  I ordered the pie to go and paid in cash.  The crust was nice and the lemon was damn near perfect, but there was maybe a 1/8 inch layer of lemon topped with well over an inch of meringue. Mixed drinks pricy ($12 for a Ketel and soda), and I couldn&#39;t help but notice that they were actually using shot glasses to measure the booze.  Haven&#39;t seen that kind of bullshit stateside since college, and never at $12 per.",313,2,1,-1,-36,-1.5043000000000002,2.15,3.0619999999999994,24.785999999999998,No

We were promptly seated and our water server quickly filled our water glasses. Our server then came over after we had a moment to look at the menu to take our drink order. We had 2 of the peach teas with bourbon and the fruit punch with burbon. Very well composed drinks, sting enough but without over powering the other flavors if the drink. The fruit punch had a delicious dirty cherry on the cocktail skewer. It was just like a gusher. (I&#39;m ordering these!) We then placed our order and our food we ordered the soup of the day, chicken noodle to start. It was delicious. A mouthwatering cup of soup. We added a bit of their signature hot sauce to the soup to give it a try and it was equally as delicious. With in 10 minutes our food came out of the open kitchen, piping hot, 2 orders of chicken and waffle and chicken nuggets with a side of mac &amp; cheese. All of it was so good! The waffle was light and fluffy with delicious maple syrup topped 2 large pieces of hot, crispy, and juicy chicken. It was a great portion of food. The chicken nuggets came with a tasty (mayo based) dipping sauce. There was at least 6-8+ chicken nuggets and the Mac and cheese was was thick, creamy, and cheddar cheesey.

The fact they they are relaxed makes you feel relaxed. I had the dirty burger and it was amazing. I was only able to finish half of my burger but I wish I could finish the whole thing.

First, off we ordered drinks (cocktails; 2 Soho Mules, 1 tomato juice, and 1 white wine).  We then ordered food (1 crispy chicken sandwich, 1 bacon dirty burger, 1 avocado and chicken salad, 1 biscuits and gravy, and an order of fries to split).Our food came out first (before our drinks).  We had to ask where are drinks were 3 times and they didn&#39;t arrive until halfway through our meal.  Our side order of fries also didn&#39;t come until half way through the meal.  We also had to request more water multiple times so we had something to drink, since we still hadn&#39;t received our beverages.The chicken sandwich was great, after removing close to 20 pieces of sliced pepper, which made it close to inedible.  Th biscuits and gravy were great, but the ratio of gravy to biscuits was terrible, and half of them had to be eaten dry.  No complaints with the salad or burger.Lastly, the bus boy kept coming around are removing our napkins and water glasses that we were still using (our glasses were empty due to lack of filling, not because we were done).  They also kept trying to remove our plates multiple times while we were still eating (we were eating slow due to the lack of beverages to wash it down).They did eventually take our drinks off our bill since we had to wait so long.  But with the lack of service and poor service when we did get it, makes me question if I would eat here again.

There is none other but the newly opened Chicken Shop that&#39;s discreetly situated in the upper floor of the SoHo House. This is the first U.S. outpost of the London-based original with the main focus being chicken roasted on a spit. The chicken are available in whole, half, and quarter sizes with very reasonable prices. My friend and I shared the half chicken along with a side dish of butter lettuce and avocado salad. Both were served in very old-school steel plates. It was a very balanced meal but was not quite enough for two. The chicken was very flavorful with extra crispy skin. The downside was the dryness so I was not stingy about drenching them in the smokey and spicy sauces. The salad had about half an avocado in there. The lettuce was very fresh and dressing was unnecessary. I will most likely return and when that time comes, I will order two sides as opposed to one. I would also skip the warm chocolate brownie. It was too sweet for my preferences and I had hope the scoop of ice cream would be slightly bigger.P.S. I really like how they make the chicken in the diner behind the counter. It is visible to the patrons yet it does not have a strong smell.

Went around 7pm on a rainy Wednesday evening and were seated right away at the counter. The place was not very busy but the counter was full. Maybe it was the cute foreign cook because everyone at the counter was a girl. The menu itself isn&#39;t very large. Just a few choices (which frankly is a welcome relief in a world chalked full of Cheesecake Factory type menus). You have your choice of spitfire chicken in a few different sizes and a few sides. We settled on ordering the half chicken (large enough for two girls), Mac &amp; cheese, butterleaf &amp; avocado salad, and coleslaw.   It was also our lucky night as the restaurant was changing their menu the next day and adding two additional items: a hamburger and collard greens. Both of which we got to try for free! Let&#39;s start with the main entrees.  The chicken was juicy and had a nice slightly woody smoke to it from the wood fire. I also tried the house sauce and wasn&#39;t a big fan. Not bad just not fond of them.  However, the big winner tonight was the burger. Juicy and a bit sloppy but worth it. It rivaled au chavel&#39;s burger. As for sides my winners were the coleslaw and the collard greens.  The Mac &amp; cheese was a complete miss for me.  The coleslaw was a creamy mayo based style but wasn&#39;t overly drenched which they often tend to be. The collard greens aren&#39;t your Deep South ham hock style. Instead they are still crisp with a bright lemony flavor. My one big grip for the evening was the sugar for my ice tea. As a southerner in Chicago I&#39;ve gotten used to not having sweet tea as an option and am used to adding the sugar myself. When I asked for just plain/regular sugar I was brought a few packets (oh honey....I&#39;m southern I like my sugar with a little bit of tea) of Splenda. Um....yuck.  When I said that I wanted just plain ole white sugar I was brought the cubes of hard sugar typically reserved for coffee or other hot drinks that can melt the granules. All night I drank my tea and then crunched on the sugar. I know a small &amp; trivial grip to most but I like my tea sweet.",250,4,2,5,34,4.4655000000000005,2.995,1.04,24.967,No
chicken-and-farm-shop-chicago,Monique B.,spkspIaGx9aj8wsnGOVnqA,plmcW2qav9RsCIwzGGoXBg,"Don&#39;t go.  While the service was excellent and it&#39;s located in the swanky new SOHO hotel it is super overpriced, average tasting chicken.  I went with some friends and we shared a half chicken and a fried chicken sandwich and a side of collard greens.  Again, no complaints on the service, and the atmosphere is hipster cute with old school tables, chairs and decor.The chicken is not really rotisserie because they steam cook it and then just stick it on the rotisserie for the last 10 minutes to brown the skin.  As a lover of crispy chicken skin, this was a no go because the skin was soggy and sad.  I found the chicken lacked seasoning, although it was moist.  It was just ok, but to be honest, the $5 rotisserie chicken at your local grocery store tastes better and costs 1/4 of the price (Sam&#39;s Club has the best, in my opinion).  The fried chicken sandwich was delicious and had the crispy skin that I crave.  The homemade sweet pickles were delicious, and it came with an avocado aioli that my friends loved, but I asked to have on the side because I don&#39;t like avocado.  It was a nice size, and if I ever came back I would get this instead of the &#34;rotisserie&#34; chicken, but for $12 I would recommend going to Wendy&#39;s or Chik-fil-A for 2 crispy chicken sandwiches, with 2 fries and 2 drinks.  You&#39;ll get more, it will be much tastier and there will be more than enough to share.As for the collard greens, they were sauteed, so to me they were undercooked and had very little seasoning.  The portion size was small and they were expensive to boot.  My little sister also got a chocolate milk shake with a shot of Khalua.  $12, for about 12 oz.  Good, but nothing special, and you could barely taste the alcohol.  It may have been homemade ice cream from a cow they milk daily on the roof, and only feed hand cut hay, but it tasted like a plain old chocolate milk shake.  I had heard so much hype about how great the chicken is here, but honestly, I will not recommend, will not come back and can&#39;t understand how this place stays open.  They don&#39;t have anything except chicken and sides on the menu, everything is unbelievably overpriced and worst of all, the food isn&#39;t that great.  For 3 people our bill was $50, and only 1 of us had a drink.  We all left still unsatisfied and went around the corner to Mariano&#39;s to get something else to snack on.

Enter Soho House and its new restaurants, still so new that people aren&#39;t aware it&#39;s there - and hence no line *whew*.Chicken Shop hit the spot perfectly - price point and all. Half a chicken for $14? *slow claps* the drinks aren&#39;t priced as cheaply - average for the neighborhood ($12 manhattans), but still, it was all a very nice bill. 3 of us split a half chicken, crinkle cut fries, corn on the cob and mac and cheese and took some home. The chicken was cooked well, the sides were all great standards. Corn on the cob came 3 to a plate with garlic butter drizzled over it as an option, and in particular it was delicious. I liked that they had the cowshed products in the bathroom - they were so lovely.

I was a little disappointed in my order as the dish was mostly 4 biscuits sitting on top of a little bit of pot pie. I wouldnt order this again.

The chicken sandwich consisted of toasted bread with sliced battered fried chicken with lettuce, pickles, spread and some jalape’±o peppers. I absolutely thought the entire item as a whole was perfection. it is very filling and large enough to be shared (if you order a side dish as well). Reasonable price of $10  while theMac and cheese was also very flavorful and cheesy it was $8 and was a much smaller size. The chicken for the chicken and waffles was so juicy and crispy!

Came here last night w the BF ... we were hungry and couldnt decide btwn Au Cheval or Green Street.  i kept on craving bread / carbs for some reason and immediately i thought mmm cornbread would be great rt now.. and lo and behold a lightbulb went off and we decided on Chicken Shop!Plus the option of having a lighter dinner (im lookin at u rotisserie chicken) was more enticing.We came in around 9pm.  The hostess was super nice.  We sat down immediately.  The place is definitely dark but it is inside the Soho Hotel upstairs next to Allis.  Anywho, we ordered the half chicken, cornbread, fries, and the fried chicken sammich.  No drinks.  Half chicken- Mmmm!! So juicy.  Not dry at all!  The rub on this was tasty.  Had a sweet and salty taste to it.  Definitely a fan.Cornbread:  Oh my carby heaven.  This comes w a honey butter.  I grew up on generic Jiffy cornbread and this took me back to when i would whip up a batch when i was younger.  Its def on the sweeter side... it perfectly crumbles and wasnt dry at all either.  And the buttah.. don&#39;t get me started.  Can i just rub it all over myself and lick??? Fries:  Yummy.  I&#39;m a sucker for crinkle cut thick fries as these are.  They remind me of the fries from Portillos.  Crunchy on the outside nice and soft on the inside.  They were yummy although a wee bit too salty for my taste.  But no biggie.Fried Chicken Sandwich:  Ooh is this huge!  and yummy.  its two fried chicken pieces in btwn the bread .. served w coleslaw.  This would be like the perfect hangover meal if i was in the mood for chicken instead of a burger.  Def a calorie bomb.. but def good.Service:  Fast and courteous.  Our server was super friendly.. explained the menu to us.  As we were leaving she also mentioned that if we liked the place it would be worth checking it out during the wknd for brunch.  She also mentioned that the fried chicken sandwich gets dolled up for the wknd with avocado, tomato and i forgot what else.  Umm.. yes please!  You had me at avocado , girl!  Bottom Line..

My go to for breakfast is the monique&#39;s love which is a breast and a waffle.

Typically after eating one bite I&#39;m full and uncomfortable, but the waffles were thin and the batter was made out of something that happen to be easier to digest. These waffles were top notch! They give you two per order and it was the closest I&#39;ve ever come to eating an entire waffle. Clearly it&#39;s not made out of the stuff that blows up in your tummy. 3) The sides - over easy eggs, and grits were also cooked to perfection.

To be honest, simply the thought of chicken and waffles together (more specifically, fried chicken and maple syrup) disgusted me. However, a friend of ours treated us to dinner here a couple years ago, and I wasn&#39;t about to be that jerk who ruins a perfectly good outing by complaining about things that I only thought I wouldn&#39;t like. Thus, I gave it a try. Now I&#39;m a fan!Aimee M. and I were in the area for the Health &amp; Fitness Expo at McCormick Place (don&#39;t laugh) and I had suggested grabbing a late lunch here. We arrive around 2:30pm and the line was just out the door. I put in a table request and we waited quite a while.It was a little annoying to see a number of smaller tables go unused for the majority of the time we waited, but it all made sense when they got to a larger party and pushed them together. It would be nice to be seated as they can accommodate you, but there&#39;s something to be said for playing fair and making sure you get people seated in order. And we lucked out when a party of about 8 people ahead of us decided they didn&#39;t want to wait any longer and left.I decided to order the Betty Lou combo, which is a 1/2 fried chicken (I got a mix of white and dark) with 2 waffles. I also ordered a Strawberry Lemonade and Aimee and I split some Greens (She thought they were too salty but I LOVED them. They are cooked with ham.), Mac and Cheese (I&#39;d probably skip it next time but she was very happy with it.), and the Yams (This was the winner!).Our wait for a table was long but the delivery of the food was phenomenally fast.

Oh my gawd the Waaaaaait!This was Saturday about 2:30 in the afternoon and the line was just outside the door. Since this was my first visit I didn&#39;t know if it was usually this busy at this time but a lady who got in line behind us said &#34;I should know better than to come here on a Saturday&#34;.  So I guess that answered that. Ericka A and I arrived here after getting our Shamrock Shuffle race packets at McCormick Place--note to self, if coming here after a packet pick up, bring some of the free snacks so I can eat something while we wait. What made the wait even more unbearable is that you are literally standing above the dining area while you wait and you can see and smell all the delicious food at the tables.  So probably about 45 stomach rumbling mouth watering minutes later we are finally seated. The host was an adorable older man who apologized for the wait but welcomed us and thanked us profusely for choosing to visit the restaurant. You can imagine how busy this place was that day.  Servers buzzing around, tables getting cleared, pick up orders getting picked up...the saving grace is that our food was delivered to our table in record fast time. And it was freakin&#39; delicious. We both opted for the chicken and waffles entree and split a side of fried catfish, yams, collard greens and mac n cheese. Everything was really good.  The chicken was crispy and tender. A bite of chicken with waffle and bit of syrup reduced me to a happy mushy mess. The yams were just as sweet and flavorful as I thought they would be.  The Mac n Cheese had the bits of crusty oven crisp cheese that I love.  The catfish had a wonderful cornmeal crust and cooked to perfection.  Added some hot sauce to add a little kick and once again I am sighing in contentment.  Although it was a nice sized serving, the greens were just too salty for me. The waffle, which also had good flavor, wasn&#39;t as crispy soft as i like, it was more like a sponge cake, but was still a good vehicle for the chicken. I ended up with leftovers that made for a perfect midnight snack after my race.  I&#39;d love to go back but not sure when the lowest wait times would be. Anyone want to help a girl out?  is there even a short wait time for this place?

I just posted one for Chicago-famous Harold&#39;s, so why not another for the commonly known preeminent chicken and waffle house of Chicagoland?Unfortunately for this place, like Harold&#39;s, I grade on a Houston curve. And I&#39;ve not had better chicken and waffles than at the Breakfast Klub, a Houston institution. But let&#39;s talk Chicago. The place is in the corner office of a small strip with some apartments atop, in a not un-quaint part of Chicago&#39;s south side. The brownstone architecture around the neighborhood is, in fact, rather nifty. Additionally, this restaurant&#39;s proximity to Cellular Field, with not much else nearby besides chain food, makes it a particularly good pre-game stop if you&#39;re going to a Sox game.But it&#39;s all about the food, and Chicago&#39;s Home has good, but not great, chicken and waffles. Like Harold&#39;s, this location suffers from the absurdly small chicken. A quarter meal with a waffle sets you back above a Hamilton; there&#39;s no reason to be stingy with the bird for those prices. Unlike Harold&#39;s, the chicken here is decently good with a nice flavor--think mild at Church&#39;s or Popeyes.The waffle is wholly disappointing. it&#39;s soft and soggy, like an Eggo waffle that&#39;s been exposed to too much frostbite and can&#39;t shed the water weight in the toaster. The waffle requires copious dunking in the syrup, a big no-no.Beyond the chicken and waffles, Chicago&#39;s Home has an extensive menu, and we helped ourselves to some red beans and rice and greens as sides, both tasty. I&#39;d been particularly craving red beans and rice, after having gone on multiple diatribes about how impossible it is to find proper cajun food in Chicago (and no, Heaven on Seven does not count). So just having a red beans and rice option was good enough for me to like it.There&#39;s some complaints about the wait time, but we came entirely off-peak and had no issues with service or wait. The place is clean, there&#39;s street and lot parking, and the food is good, if not spectacular.",240,4,1,1,-18,0.9236999999999999,1.8840000000000001,1.792,16.323,No

This review is pretty much based on service. There were 2 other small table of 3 people there when we got there. We were seated immediately and rushed to put in our orders, before we had water or silverware on the table. We had to tell the server 2x we were not ready to order.I ordered the Nicole Marie&#39;s : 2 piece dark with your choice of one of the following: waffle, potato salad or fries  for $8.75I have to admit that this place has one of the best waffles I&#39;ve ever tasted in my life. There is a hint of cinnamon, vanilla, and possibly nutmeg in the waffle. This is a straight up deliciously thin and chewy waffle that hardly needs the butter and maple syrups that comes with it. It&#39;s tasty all on it&#39;s own. Don&#39;t confuse the waffle for the stuff you would get at IHOP. Those are Belgium waffles and quite frankly I find them to be boring. I went with a chicken thigh and a leg. The leg was small, but well seasoned. The thigh was a relatively small piece, but juicy and melt in your mouth delicious.I&#39;m usually really good about snapping pictures of the food and menu for comparison, but I left feeling peeved and unsatisfied from the service experience. By the time we got our food ( roughly 11:15 AM), the restaurant was slammed packed. We had to hunt down our server to get extra napkins, water, and to place a to go order. The server did not look pleased that we didn&#39;t put our to go order from the start. When we did receive our food, it was a good thing that we checked because we got pieces of chicken that we did not ask for. When we asked to have the server corrected, more annoyed looks.

Additionally, I will never know how good their Peach Cobbler is because they never have this item. This is my third attempt at carry out within the past 3 years. I have waited to go back for several months in between because the experience has always been JUST that bad. Given these 3 encounters I can only imagine what the true dining experience must be like. I have posted about each experience before and each time I am even more disappointed. I believe in supporting businesses in my neighborhood. I literally live right across the street and this time I decided to try a different approach to ordering my food. In the past, I have ordered via telephone or in person and experienced delays in receiving my order in upwards of an hour or more. With each experience I have been told that they have ran out of the requested sides. I am cracking up because I have only ordered sides, and I fail to see the difficulty in maintaining staples.This go around I ordered and paid for my 2 sides online. I purposefully waited 30 minutes before going across the street to pick up my order. When I get there I am told that there is a 2 hour wait because one of my sides is in the oven. The cashier asked me if I wanted to wait.Huh???? She then had difficulty figuring out that I had pre-paid because I placed the order online. I requested a refund due to the 2 hour delay and was initially told that they could not refund my money. As a result they asked me several time if I wanted a substitute for my order. NO. Then after some persistence I was told that my money had been refunded and that I needed to take his word because they could not issue a receipt.  A small decently dress guy then handed me the remaining sided item. When I requested a bag, his reply was that he thought I was being eco-friendly. While I presumed that he was making a joke I had failed to see the humor given they had now already sucked 35 minutes of my time for 1 side order.  I asked multiple times for the manager on duty.  Finally, I was acknowledged by the manager but &#34;I&#34; had to politely ask him to share his name. I shared with him my previous experiences, however he never asked me my name nor did he seem interested that I am a neighborhood customer After my inquiry he shared that he was the owner&#39;s cousin who is in training to manage the soon to be open restaurant in Cleveland. smh.

She warned me it would be busy so I hopped out the car to get in line while she found parking. She was right the restaurant was busy but they are very quick and efficient and my wait was not long. The restaurant is very charming and the d’©cor is very warm, welcoming and comforting. I was surprised and impressed when the hostess pulled out my chair for me to sit. As I looked around I notice the restaurant was filled with well dressed, happy families (It was a Sunday and I assume most of them were coming after church) it was just a beautiful sight to see. The menu is extensive and I wanted to order absolutely everything but I decided the dark meat combo with a side waffle to split with my best friend. The combo came with three sides and corn bread. I chose the Mac and cheese, Cajun rice and beans and the collard greens. I don&#39;t eat pork so the waiter informed me that they make the collard greens with turkey (I assumed smoke) because I know some people make it with ham hocks (form recipes I&#39;ve read haha). To wash it down we ordered their famous strawberry lemonade. I am actually smiling while I write this review thinking back on how good this food was. It was perfect! The fried chicken was moist on the inside, with a nice crunchy skin not too thick or thin and seasoned to perfection. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy like a mac and cheese should be. The collard greens tasted NOTHING like I thought they would they were the bomb! I never knew greens could taste so good, that turkey gave it some real flavor. I need to learn how to make that entire meal because I have been craving it ever since. Oh, I can&#39;t forget about that lemonade that was the real deal and not made from concentrate. It was sour like lemonade is supposed to me but the real chunks of strawberries is what made this lemonade the best lemonade I&#39;ve ever had.

The same waiter (that smelled like Newport 100s) then proceed to say he is a manager and I can let him know what&#39;s going on. I explained the issue about the order and not being informed and he asked to see my receipt. I told him I am not looking for them to do anything on my bill. The service sucks. Then the fact he is saying he is a manager- if that WAS the case, why wouldn&#39;t you assist from the start instead of walking back for the REAL one? I hate when people try to play on people&#39;s intelligence. I don&#39;t live in the area, but try to support local restaurants, especially theirs, but I won&#39;t be back for service like that! I mean if the guy didn&#39;t feel like walking to the front to handle customer service issues, he should have said he wasn&#39;t available, not gone, but ok! I get it. Oh, and I am one of those that tip on take out orders, but of course I refused to on this occasion. I will say this- get it together!

Received food with no parmesan cheese, and I don&#39;t have any at home. Called to ask about parmesan cheese. First person I spoke to seemed sympathetic but placed me on hold. Second person (apparently the manager) was not sympathetic and somewhat rude, saying the food is already tossed with parm. He said parm on the side is $1.50 and to use Uber again to order it. Basically a &#34;let them eat cake&#34; non-solution. I even looked at the restaurant a second time in the Ubereats app. No where is there an option to choose a side of cheese.Looking at the spaghetti and meatball dish, there is definitely no parm in it. Called a second time to say that the food was not tossed in parm. Got the first guy again. The best he could offer was $5 off a future order, but I would not take the chance to order again.

Let me explain.I showed up to pick up carry out food promptly at 6 o&#39;clock (the time that the restaurant said the food would be done). When I arrived, the server told me it would be around 10 minutes longer. 10 minutes came and went, though, and when I asked a different server how much longer, she said another 5 minutes. I end up waiting another 30 minutes before finally asking where my food is again. Finally, they bring it out and apologize for it taking so long, but I was already pretty annoyed. That isn&#39;t what ruined my night, though, it gets much worse.As I leave the restaurant having almost an hour of my time wasted, I place the food on my front seat and start driving. In the 10 minutes it took me to reach my destination, the bottom of the bag containing my food completely filled up with hot oil and was leaking all over my car seat (it was a paper bag). The only problem though is that I didn&#39;t notice it was leaking until I picked it up and placed it on my lap. The hot oil dripped onto me and burned my leg pretty badly. Not only that, but the smell in my car is terrible and I have to pay to have my car seat professionally cleaned to get the smell out. I really can&#39;t say why the bag was leaking, I kept it upright the entire time, but I assume they didn&#39;t bag it correctly because they were already so late with the food.

It seemed like instead of giving me the extra vegetables I paid for, they just gave me less noodles! Yeah. And to add insult to injury, the vegetables were damn near raw, not that good fresh-n-vibrant cooked-n-crunchy, but super under cooked and tough. Then the noodles were overcooked.

Many modern Mexican restaurants have done away with serving chips at the table (unless you order them) but what may be worse than not serving chips at all is when they serve you stale ones.  This was not the case here.  The chips were salty and delicious and came with four different and unique salsas - salsa verde, roasted tomato, chile de ’çrbol, and avocado.  I would eat any of them again, but the avocado and arbol were my favorites.  The salsa was spicy, and made my eyes water, which made me very happy, because I eat a lot of spicy food and feel sad when chefs make their salsa bland to make up for all the wimpy palates out there!As far as the food, I had three tacos - the carne asada, the al pastor and the adobo chicken.  Everything was delicious and freshly prepared.  The chicken was very tender, the carne asada was smoky and flavorful, and the pastor was spicy and sweet with fresh pineapple chunks.There were a lot of other things on the menu that looked awesome - the breakfast menu in particular was intriguing.  My dining partners-in-crime both had tortas with tasty crunchy rolls.  Everyone was pleased with their meal, the pricing was affordable and the service was great; all in all, a perfect lunch from Jarabe!  Taco there or regret it forever!",185,5,1,3,6,2.6368000000000005,1.791,0.653,13.556000000000001,No

jarabe-mexican-street-food-chicago,Nick M.,F4Z5uxhcUduROfHEFOCaIg,nBwOSHuMrdDQglv3dCD5fA,"For those of you who don&#39;t know, Jarabe is the storefront restaurant from the brothers who were responsible for the La Adelita food truck, which had my absolute favorite Mexican food of any truck or brick and mortar in Chicago. I didn&#39;t think it could get much better than that, but with the space and resources of the Jarabe kitchen at their disposal, they are churning out the most delicious and authentic Mexican food you will find in Chicago. While their dishes are unique, these guys simply make the classics BETTER than anyone else. Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Chilaquiles (my personal favorite, on a bed of ridiculously tasty chips), etc. My girlfriend tried the breakfast burrito and gave me a bite so I could experience the crispiness of the potatoes, truly unique! As she pointed out, breakfast burritos are often drippy messes stuffed with too much eggs and cheese. This was a balanced, nuanced Burrito with a variety of flavors and textures. In fact, she just texted me a picture of it with the caption &#34;Remember this???&#34; I think we&#39;ll be back.Okay, I wanted to give the previously mentioned chips their own paragraph. If you stop in and don&#39;t get a full meal, you&#39;re missing out. But if you don&#39;t get at least some chips and salsa/sauce/guac, you&#39;re letting down the whole human race. These chips are what I call &#34;two-ply&#34; meaning it&#39;s almost like they&#39;re made of two thin chips joined together. They sort of bubble up as a result and are flaky, crispy, warm, and perfect. They are made fresh several times a day and heated in the oven for maximum warmth/crispiness. Just the right amount of coarse sea salt. If you love tortilla chips and salsa, you will not want to go back to the bagged, bland, or otherwise stale chips found at 90% of other Mexican joints.Seriously, SO satisfied with our meal. Best chips on earth. Hope this place gets the business it deserves, cause it&#39;s so damn tasty.",225,5,2,5,23,4.9794,2.747,0.8760000000000001,16.378999999999998,No

I wanted Mexican food today (1/8/16) and based upon all of the positive reviews, decided to try Jarabe. At 11:00 a.m., I placed the following online order for delivery from EAT24: Carne Asada soft shell tacos, Carne Asada burrito, and chips and guacamole. The order arrived earlier than anticipated and the driver called to say she did not know what unit to deliver the order to, which is clearly on the EAT24 order. When I opened the food, it wreaked of a burnt aroma, and the food was cold! When I attempted to move the tacos from the foil to a plate to microwave them, the shells fell apart, which is an indication that the shells are old and stale. When I tasted the food, the skirt steak tasted bitter and burnt and the cheese was lumpy! The burrito also had a burnt smell, rightfully so, because the underside of the tortilla was burnt (wish I could post the picture)! Also, like the tacos, the skirt steak tasted burnt and bitter; the onions were overwhelming; and and there were no visible signs of avocado, cheese and sour cream - and they were not on the side either! The guacamole was weak and most of the chips were also burnt! OMG, who was the cook (at 11:00 a.m.!) and who bagged this garbage for delivery? I called the restaurant, and in the manager&#39;s absence, spoke to Anthony. Anthony was very apologetic and volunteered to refund my money, and EAT24 was in agreement. Anthony also suggested that I follow-up with the managers, Alexa and Teddy, who will be in the restaurant next week, but for what?

What I had was basically grilled pork meat that tasted like a pork chop I cut into little pieces, which is fine but just don&#39;t call it al pastor because it is not.  If you over cook pork, especially it gets dry.  I basically had charred dry pork tacos.  The only flavor was the pineapple and salsa.  Also, onion cilantro and pineapple should be diced into very small pieces not big ol&#39; chunks.  These are not traditional style tacos, they are an interpretation which I&#39;m all for, but only when it works and btw burritos aren&#39;t Mexican street food; they aren&#39;t even Mexican.

Our server told us &#34;yo no hablo o entiendo mas ingles, pero hare mi mejor esfuerzo.&#34;  There was no problem with hubby and I since we could get by with basic conversational Spanish.  We both ordered the &#34;plato de birria,&#34; which is the goat soup.  However, if you just want the &#34;soup,&#34; order &#34;consome de birria.&#34;  On the other hand, if you would like the &#34;goat meat,&#34; order the &#34;goat stew&#34; or &#34;pura maciza&#34; on the menu.I saw the patrons who sat near us opted for the consome and 1lb. maciza (pure meat).  By the way, I didn&#39;t know I could get unlimited refills for consome until our server came by and said &#34;necesitas mas consome?&#34;  I took advantage of this opportunity, asked for more soup, and added onion and cilantro in it.  I recommend you all to do the same so you can really get your money&#39;s worth.   Their agua de Jamaica was lightly sweetened.  I typically don&#39;t like drinks to be very saturated with sugar, so it was refreshing and delectable.  For $19.98, we had un plato de birria (chico), un plato de birria (grande), and una jamaica.  I can&#39;t wait to come back here for some birria fiesta!",196,5,2,3,33,2.4724999999999997,1.5430000000000001,0.5,16.956999999999997,No

Found one in this cute neighborhood not far from downtown Chicago. We immediately took an uber and walked right into it. They were doing street and building construction when we visited a few weeks ago so we may have easily missed it if it wasn&#39;t for the OPEN sign.The Birria was super rich.... Lot&#39;s of meat and available in either medium or large bowls. We got two large and shared between three people.

Birreria Reyes de Ocotlan is a temple to the taco god. Specifically the birria sect. Totally cool by me. I got the goat, because goat. And it was fantastic. Juicy, messy, flavorful, delicious. Everything I wanted.But after savoring my taco, the guy behind the counter gave me a free taco that I think was liver. He&#39;d asked if I&#39;d had one before, and I said no.

See, I accidentally turned our tiny two-top into an impromptu bowling lane.  With the &#34;pins&#34; set up in front of my wife.  Transmogrifying myself into a world-class doofus for a half-second too long, I carelessly allowed a bottle of smoky hot salsa to tip over.  Not only did it spray my wife&#39;s sweater, but it tipped over her Diet coke into her lap, flipped her taco out of its basket and onto the table, and dumped a bowl of dried chiles onto the floor.  Holy Baby Bejeebus:  Horrible, and incredible.  You can best believe that she was none too happy.  But luckily for me, my wife is a forgiving person!(Anyway, they say &#34;50 million Elvis fans can&#39;t be wrong.&#34;  Don&#39;t know about that.  But I say that 4 billion goat-eaters can&#39;t be wrong.  (Although goat isn&#39;t the most-produced meat on the planet--Western consumption of huge quantities of pork, beef, and chicken makes sure of that--it&#39;s apparently eaten by a larger percentage of the world&#39;s population than any other.)  I&#39;d been waiting to get to a birrieria for a long time, and then I went and ruined the experience.)Our idea had been to do a mid-day taco/pupusa crawl on 18th Street, but I went and spoiled that, too, by being unable to refrain from eating too much food.  Ordered goat and cabeza tacos and a cup of goat stew here.  Order got lost in translation, and I ended up with an extra taco, and goat consomme instead of stew.  I had thought that the $2.50 and $2.75 prices for the tacos sounded a little high, but they are huge.  Nonetheless, I had no self-control, devoured everything (including the extra taco), and pretty much destroyed my appetite for the rest of our project.  Everything was terrific, as just about everybody else here says.Minor complaints:  The huge, succulent, juicy tacos come rolled up in wax paper, and by the time you get through your first one, your second (and third and fourth?) will already be getting soggy.  And as I noted above, my order got lost in translation a bit.  (That obviously won&#39;t be a problem for Spanish speakers, who are by far the main clientele here.)  But our server was very clear in communicating that the disaster I created at our table wasn&#39;t a big deal, and I was very appreciative for that.",287,4,1,1,-35,0.9869999999999998,2.656,2.69,20.653000000000002,No

And it was, by chance, one of my sophomore English students that told me to go check out the restaurant his mom owns. &#34;You should go on a weekend because that&#39;s when I work!&#34; he said--the adorable little peanut face that he is. And so a co-worker and I did a little research and found the Esquire magazine article where Bayliss lists this place as his favorite fast-food. Other famous chefs were also interviewed, naming such obvious places as Dairy Queen, In-n-Out Burger, and Burger King--(seriously Guy Fieri and Bobby Flay??) Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with chain restaurant fast food meals--God knows I love me a Daily Double from McD&#39;s--but you could sort of tell Rick Bayliss had pure comfort food in mind. I ended up going with a few other co-teachers one hot August day right before school started. It was frighteningly warm in the place--a puddle of sweat collected beneath my running shorts in the booth and I know I looked like a red-faced gringo sitting there, sipping goat consomme and choking down the deliciously spicy pickled onions and peppers. But that&#39;s all part of the experience at Birreria Reyes de Ocotlan. It feels so much more special with it&#39;s 90-degrees outside, as if you&#39;re actually eating birria at some local favorite hotspot in Mexico. I now equate the flavor of chivo with warm weather and I have yet to visit Birreria Reyes when snow is on the ground, and I wonder if that will spoil the experience. On my first visit, I ordered the traditional meal: the goat meat served with consomme. It is accompanied by lime, cilantro, onions, and then a little dish of hot, pickled onions and peppers. I made individual tacos and dunked them in the consomme before each bite. The goat meat is absolutely outstanding--there is no gaminess, no odd flavor. It is tender, with little sinews of fat interlaced to beef up the flavor and provide the right amount of juiciness. I gave my student and his mother--the owner--a hug that day and was ecstatic to find that he presented me (and my fellow teacher accompaniments) with a Mexico soccer jersey with their advertisement on the back at school the following Monday. I&#39;d be happy ordering the same thing at this place every time I went, but my student enticed me to the other menu items. &#34;Would you like to try a cabeza taco?&#34; he asked one Saturday afternoon.Hell, yes.And there it was---all tender and flavorful without a gristly part on it. It was a heavy taco, stuffed with cabeza, but not at all runny. This wasn&#39;t a taco that with a disintegrating tortilla. No, this was a perfectly made cabeza taco with onion and cilantro. I told him how good it was. &#34;That&#39;s because I made it,&#34; he beamed and brought me out a few samples of Mexican candy and some fresh pineapple juice. I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that birria in Chicago is like what the &#34;world&#39;s greatest cup of coffee&#34; is in New York. There are hundreds of places that claim they&#39;ve got the best there is--even several right in the same neighborhood as Birreria Reyes.

They make birria, which is a goat stew. I&#39;ve had this stew before in Mexico and since it was 100 degrees out I decided to pass on that and went for the tacos. Their menu is simple (basically goat and a few types of tacos), but there were definitely some items that were new to me (cows head, goat liver, tongue). I opted for 2 tacos and I&#39;m glad I did two instead of three because these were quite filling. I got the chiva (goat) and cabeza (cows head). Let&#39;s talk about the cows head first. This taco is filled with various parts of the cow&#39;s tender head meat (brains, cheek, eyes, tongue), but if no one told you what you were eating you would just think it&#39;s the tenderest, juiciest beef taco you&#39;ve ever had. If you can get past the idea of what you are eating, or at least convince yourself that it&#39;s something else, then you are in for a treat.

Let&#39;s start with the service, they were quick to attend to their customers, friendly and very hospitable indeed. When I walked in the door, I didn&#39;t even have to look at a menu, my mind was focused on one thing and one thing only, rolling up my sleeves, putting the napkin on my lap, opening up my can of soda and getting ready to just dig in. The aromas of birria steam danced circles around me, seducing all of my senses.  I went right to ordering one pound of birria to share, which is a very nice &amp; plentiful order to share. All of the add ons accompanied the one pound of meat...a nice plate of cilantro, onions, and limes. Each of us also received a nice steamy bowl of their very tasty consomme and over a dozen of hot and ready tortillas de maiz. The meat was tender, it almost melted in my mouth. I made myself a few tacos with all the condiments and dipped each bite into the consomme and not once did I mind that the juices of the meat ran down my arms and sleeves. And that tasty bowl of consomme, was good to the last drop, I had absolutely no shame in pickin&#39; up that bowl and drinking it until the last drop of it went into my mouth. :) Like I said, I knew when I walked into this place, I was ready to do some serious birria-eating business. For just about twenty dollars, we both ate a meal that was fit for a king. I&#39;m going to say that the name REYES (meaning &#34;kings&#34;) might be the name of the family that owns this little hot spot, but REYES could also define that this birria itself has a definite ROYAL quality of impeccable flavor. All I can say is that if the American guru of Mexican cuisine, Rick Bayless gave this place some major props, then *you* know it is thee place to eat!

Do you have to be so obnoxious? How about making a customer feel welcomed into your place of business. I ordered a bleu burger. The burgers don&#39;t come with fries or a drink so had to order that separately. The barky girl wasn&#39;t at all helpful. The only thing she did is tell me what they didn&#39;t have.

It&#39;s located in an ultra mini retail strip at the gas station at Halsted &amp; Division, you would miss if not looking for it and to me not the best marketing strategy....or *is* it bc they&#39;ll get all the DD regulars and those filling up on petrol, time will tell.Fittingly I suppose, Wildburger&#39;s space is also ultra mini, with only two high-top style tables, perhaps making take out a better but more (potentially) messy option, should you choose to dine Al car-o. In keeping with the mini theme, this is perhaps where Wildburger goes off the rails a bit....even though they aren&#39;t preparing food for an Army, simply by virtue of size of the place, they still took an insanely long time prepping our food in the open/exposed and you guessed it, *tiny* grill/expedite area.  There was another group of people who were already eating when we arrived and one of the girls clearly was not happy as she didn&#39;t get her food and by the time she did her party was already done eating.  Even the queue to order is tiny and located *right* next to the pop station making it a convoluted, crowded mess.lol  Sort it out already Wildburger.I&#39;m obviously going *against* the Wildburger theme bc this review is anything but tiny, ah well, if you&#39;re still engaged, onto the food.As mentioned, the burgers looked and smelled great but I was already eating beef the next day so wanted to forgo a huge burger.  Hindsight, mistake as the hot dog I ordered was not good, no details, just not good.  Mom&#39;s seemed like her stuffed grilled avocado which was a unique take on Stuffed Peppers.

Without me asking they put the cheese on the side so it wouldn&#39;t sog up.  Burger was cooked perfectly as specified and loved the pretzel bun.   Only thing I&#39;d note is the Chicago BBQ doesn&#39;t have much of a BBQ sauce taste to it, and was perfectly fine as is, but am sure if you ask they&#39;ll make it work.

Since I was new to town, I relied on Yelp a lot. At first, GPS of Yelp took me to somewhere close to this restaurant but I had hard time finding it. Finally, I called and they told me where they were on the second floor if I saw the sign, Men&#39;s Warehouse, on the first floor. After checking in, I waited for additional 10-15 minutes to get seated. It was packed with people and the live Jazz music was on. It was a classy and elegant restaurant with dim lighting. I ordered mojito, grilled artichokes, Rotisserie chicken with a side of cucumber and a hand made Oreo ice cream sandwich. They did an excellent job on the appetizer. The artichokes were grilled perfectly with light sea salt and amazing dipping sauce. The chicken was juicy and moist and the salad was similar like Mediterranean style. To be honest, I was pretty full after the entree but I got to have a dessert for my birthday. It was amazing! I couldn&#39;t stop eating. Every bite of food was joy. Compliment to the chef.

The food menu was pretty simple- one page, with apps, salads, entrees, desserts, and a specialties section that included a couple of sandwich options. My party all chose from the entree list, or one of the entree specials our server told us about. The only thing that was a little off was the cornbread as a starter.

bandera-restaurant-chicago,Mia B.,t43aBwH2E_OiR3_CBuhC-w,Jp3uOHKssPDCMyLINBOzHQ,"In  in the chi for the weekend  and wanted to treat a Family friend to a nice dinner. We ended up settling on this place due to another place having an hour-and-a-half wait. I should have known in Chicago it is good to call for reservations on a Saturday night especially a holiday Saturday night. We arrived and the place was packed!  we were told by the hostess that it would be around an hour wait but we could stop by the bar for drinks. The wait turned out not to be an hour, it turned out to be about 25 minutes which was good.Service:The best thing I can say about this restaurant is that their service was impeccable. From the time we stepped into the door, there was a smiling hostess and smiling maitre d. Once we got to our table our waiteress (Michelle I believe) didn&#39;t disappoint as well. She was very attentive and took care of all of our needs. She was very nice and open and we really enjoyed the hospitality of the place. The staff worked really well together to take care of each table; sometimes someone else brought us out of refills or someone else brought us our entrees, we really did not have to wait or ask for anything.AmbienceThe place is beautiful, it&#39;s nestled right on Michigan Avenue so very busy busy location.  Inside has a really nice romantic feel, the lights for dinner were dimmed  down low but you can tell that the room was very nicely laid out. One of the things that we really enjoyed was that they had a live piano player who was accompanied by a guitarist.  The pianon guy played beautifully, lots of old songs and new songs of different genres. It was such a nice background to our dinner.  The piano player does accept tips and also accepts request as well and unlike some places where the live musicians get annoyed when people ask for request whenever anyone asked of him he always had a smiling face and let them know that if you would be able to play or not.FoodThis is the area is where we ended up being disappointed. We ordered an appetizer which was the house-made cornbread. This was very delicious, very plentiful, and one of the highlights of the dinner. For my entree, I ordered the house special which consisted of baked group with lemon butter sauce, crispy shrimp on top, a side of chive mashed potatoes.  The dish was suppose to come with broccoli, however I was able to sub that for extra mashed  potatoes  at no charge.  The fish was tender but very bland :(  and the lemon butter sauce added no additional  flavor.  I tried putting  pepper on the dish to season it up but that didnt help much.  The mashed potatoes  were mixed in with chive, however, it was over kill and it totally  overpowered the taste of the potatoes.  The dish overall was a disappoint, in addition, it came out Luke warm which is never good.My husband ordered the roasted pork loin that came with the mashed potatoes and red cabbage.  His pork was very delicious (flavorful) and tender.  I think I enjoyed  his dish better than mine lol.  he the cabbage was ok and felt the same about the potatoes  that I did.  Again, his was Luke warm as well.  The pork was the warmest on his plate.Our family friend ordered the French dip sandwich. It tasted ok but again it came out just warm so 5 min into dinner it was cold.Dessert They had a house made oreo cookie ice cream sandwich.  It came with 2 cookies and was enough  to share.  This was the second  highlight of the meal.  The flavors of the dish blended in very well. Everyone  thought it was very yummy.With 2 glasses of wine, 1 app, 3 entrees, 1 desert; the bill came out to $124 .  Overall, the restaurant  has all the right  qualities to make it a 4 or 5 star, they just need to improve on the food aspect.  We won&#39;t  be dinning back due to for the price the food was lackluster and the surplus of restaurant options in Chicago for the same price range.",423,3,4,5,128,12.3035,7.523,1.5030000000000001,32.974000000000004,No

The live jazz was perfectly pitched so that people could still talk, but loud enough that a solo person like myself could still enjoy it.I ordered the veggie burger with saut’©ed spinach on the side. I debated an app and was glad I didn&#39;t - the burger was very filling! The burger patty is beet-based so when it arrived it almost looked like a meat patty. Unfortunately the patty itself had very little keeping it together except the gooey cheese on top - my first half of the sandwich went to pieces in my hand. After mopping up with a knife and fork I went to town on the second half. The trick is to leave the little pins holding it together as long as you can, and eat around the edge going for the parts that are in imminent danger of falling apart.The burger overall was good but not life changing. It was missing a certain something...I couldn&#39;t truly say what. The buttered burger bun was quite good though.The saut’©ed spinach on the side was good - not overcooked or soggy, plenty of little garlic bits.Service was great. Attentive and friendly.

Called and made a reservation for moms birthday and decided to go with this restaurant since reviews were amazing, food looked amazing and they had live jazz. They definitely were off their A game this night. Called and had reservations at 730, told them it was a special tonight as we were celebrating a big birthday. Seated right away which was good, host was not that welcoming, had to reassure them we were celebrating a birthday just to make sure the night went well. Once seated, things just didn&#39;t seem to get better. The waiter was young and didn&#39;t look like he liked this job - you&#39;re a waiter - smile a little. We ordered drinks that came out sporadically. The cocktails we ordered came out first but what made me upset is when granny ordered orange juice. It came out almost 15 minutes later then when she tried it, it was so sour and full of pulp. We had to order her something else and when we told John, the waiter that never smiles, he said that&#39;s how OJ taste then walked away. That makes sense why he&#39;s so sour if he thinks orange juice is supposed to taste sour. Overall the food was amazing. I can&#39;t complain with the chef as everyone really did enjoy the food. We had the pork, chicken and ribs, all very flavorful. When we were about finished with our entree - &#34;about finished&#34; - the unhappy waiter came over and prematurely took our plates away without even asking if we were done. I was still munching on my damn fries John. When my husband ASKED for the dessert menu, he didn&#39;t give us one, instead told us. Fine. Then we asked to order the apple a la mode, server looked surprised we were ordering dessert. That&#39;s when I just had to ask him did he know that we were celebrating moms birthday, hence why we want dessert for her special day. He said he didn&#39;t know, where the heck is the communication with the host and server. Even though the meal was delicious - there are so many places in Chicago that has amazing food.

bandera-restaurant-chicago,Steve A.,uEQ3nCdOBNOeJ0ow4Ds1vA,9ISHaxMvh6rM8NeqmkhkSA,"I love the atmosphere of this place, which is intimate and fairly dark, with spotlights aimed at the tables rather than the diners. The live jazz is just the right volume, giving the place a supper club feel.The menu is similar to Hillstone&#39;s and Houston&#39;s, which isn&#39;t surprising since it&#39;s affiliated. A couple of our favorite starters from there appear here. The spinach artichoke dip is creamy, and served with sturdy tortilla chips perfect for dipping. Also included are sour cream and a salsa with just a hint of heat. House smoked salmon is very smokey, delicate and flaky, served with crisp toast and a mayo and dill based spread.Bandera&#39;s Caesar salad isn&#39;t for purists, as it uses kale, and the croutons are made from a fairly sweet corn bread. Ours were heavily over-dressed, but when the waitress noticed we weren&#39;t enjoying them she immediately had them remade with about one fifth the dressing, and they were much better.A house specialty is the enchilada, which is available with steak or a la carte. It&#39;s a bit unusual in that it&#39;s stuffed with squash, but is quite creamy, cheesy and satisfying.Much of the menu is given over to burgers and other sandwiches, so the price for dinner and a show can be quite reasonable. Service was super attentive without being intrusive.Waits can be long, so reserve ahead, despite the fact that their reservation system doesn&#39;t work as well as opentable.This is definitely a great place for live jazz in a supper club atmosphere.",166,4,2,5,30,4.2157,2.1390000000000002,0.31499999999999995,12.546000000000001,No

It&#39;s a Hillstone restaurant so if you&#39;ve been to Houston&#39;s then you already know Bandera.  At least it&#39;s from the same American/steakhouse bloodline.We sat in a booth near the front of the restaurant overlooking the Mag Mile.  There were lots of large windows letting in a lot of light.  A large mirror behind our booth made it even brighter.  There were no empty tables in our section.  Despite the fact that it was busy, our server didn&#39;t rush us through our meal which was great.I wasn&#39;t ready for their Iron Skillet Cornbread to be so good!  They brought it out to the table in a mini cast iron skillet.  It was a Tex-Mex style cornbread with corn and jalapenos incorporated into the batter.  I usually don&#39;t like anything but plain cornbread but their version was delicious.I ordered the Rotisserie Lamb Sandwich, thinly carved slices of lamb with roasted peppers and arugula stacked on crusty bread.  I had them take it back to the kitchen and cook it longer.  I am not Team Pink Meat.  I like my meat cooked very well even if it is &#34;overcooked&#34; by restaurant standards.  When it came back out it was still very tender so I didn&#39;t need the cup of au jus at all.  The arugula on the sandwich was coated in a light vinaigrette or lemon juice that added a bright flavor.  The side dish Corn on the Cob was buttery with a nice kick from seasoned salt.The convenient-to-downtown location, sunny interior, flavorful food, attentive but unfussy service made Bandera&#39;s a great pick for our meetup.",172,4,2,5,37,4.4198,2.121,0.633,17.244999999999997,No

We were seated immediately at a table facing out toward Michigan Ave which was nice. The two waitresses that we had were very attentive and friendly. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, chicken tortilla soup and we both had the prime rib french dip. Spinach and artichoke dip was good.. Do feel like there could have been more for the price paid but it came with a side of salsa, sour cream and unlimited amount of tortilla chips. The chicken tortilla soup was really good! It had really good flavors and tasted as if it was simmering for a very long time. It honestly might be the most memorable dish of the night.. When I think about French dip I will always and forever compare it to Phillipes back home in LA. Being prime rib slices, you would expect the meat to be more tender! The au jus it came with was pretty good but I think the bread was my least favorite thing.. There is a fine line between being toasted and just dry and old.. and I thought the bread was dry and old. Had to basically submerge the bread in the jus for a while to get it to soften up!

We were seated immediately at a table facing out toward Michigan Ave which was nice. The two waitresses that we had were very attentive and friendly. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, chicken tortilla soup and we both had the prime rib french dip. Spinach and artichoke dip was good.. Do feel like there could have been more for the price paid but it came with a side of salsa, sour cream and unlimited amount of tortilla chips. The chicken tortilla soup was really good! It had really good flavors and tasted as if it was simmering for a very long time. It honestly might be the most memorable dish of the night.. When I think about French dip I will always and forever compare it to Phillipes back home in LA. Being prime rib slices, you would expect the meat to be more tender! The au jus it came with was pretty good but I think the bread was my least favorite thing.. There is a fine line between being toasted and just dry and old.. and I thought the bread was dry and old. Had to basically submerge the bread in the jus for a while to get it to soften up!

Not to mention the incredible trip tip enchilada. A well seasoned pork fillet. A girls weekend away in Chicago! Perfect stop for an amazing meal to remember that we gals will remember for awhile. Got started off with the macho salad as an appetizer we all shared and their homemade corn bread. These two alone gave a song to our tastebuds to sing! Macho salad has a great dressing, creamy goat cheese and avocado, just delish! Cornbread like never before, it&#39;s out of this world good. A little more moist than usual cornbread and a crunchy top crust that&#39;s addictive. My tri tip beef medallion paired with a hearty sized duo sauces enchilada was a great pairing. Only complaint of mine was the beef was a little fatty. The companion ladies ordered the juicy amazing rotisserie chicken &amp; beef BBQ ribs, also just perfectly seasoned with good flavor but not over powering, a great balance of textures and flavor. My aunt ordered the pork fillet that was fabulous but a little dry, very well seasoned. I just had to have the homemade Oreo ice cream sandwich with homemade ice cream!

The ribs/chicken combo meal with the coleslaw and fries made for an incredible entree. I believe the ribs exceeded the chicken in tenderness and flavor, while the coleslaw was delicious without being overwhelming. To finish off the meal, the home made oreo ice cream sandwich was suitably epic, with delightful chocolate ganache compounded with crispy disks of oreo and cookies-n-cream ice cream. Needless to say the walk back to the hotel was much slower than the walk to Bandera, but it was easily my favorite meal in Chicago (on this particular trip).",97,5,2,4,13,3.3518999999999997,1.039,0.048,4.913,No
bandera-restaurant-chicago,Jen H.,5VNLIBdp5itREaZjbB-V0g,D8ywMPoI0bDcGeSD2a6hig,"LOVE IT. My boyfriend had been planning a date for weeks during our vacation/business trip in Chicago. He raved on and on about the excellent menu choices, a signature dessert, and the thing that swoons me away the most, live jazz. Main Entrees: Bandera met all those expectations and more. I ordered the daily Fresh Fish with Lemon Butter (the one that comes with crispy rock shrimp, broccoli, and mashed potatoes) and it hit the spot! My favorite part of restaurants and dishes is where there is a variety of tastes and palettes, which this dish definitely had. My boyfriend ordered the tri-tip &amp; butternut white cheddar enchilada (we always taste each other&#39;s dishes). Very tasty and the meat was perfectly cooked and the enchilada wasn&#39;t too cheesy or filling. Delicious and zesty sauce. I would order this next time! Dessert: Then the dessert came and of course we made room for the House-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches. Never had anything like it and this dessert immediately jumped onto my top 5 of desserts tasted over the years. You could practically hear my boyfriend and I raving over this dessert and how great it tasted. Definitely something to come back for! Ambiance/Service/Music: The service was excellent. The waiter was friendly to when I realized they forgot to accommodate to an allergy (scallions in the mashed potatoes), and brought out a new side dish right away, scallion-free. The waiters cracked jokes to us and made it a good time. Music came out halfway into our dinner and even though we were sitting right next to the band, I was still able to carry on normal level conversation over a glowing view of North Michigan Ave&#39;s bustling streets. Tip for ambiance, no athletic wear or shirtless sleeves. Since this surprise date included trekking 5 hours prior in Chicago, we dressed for the exercising and were slightly under-dressed. Was still seated but will keep this in mind for next time! Overall: An excellent experience and date and I seriously applaud my boyfriend for finding this place. Not only was the food delicious, but it was complimented by great service, classy music, and a true ambiance of the city. Will need to return once in Chicago again!",253,5,3,5,79,7.8168999999999995,4.644,0.4,18.955000000000005,No

Bandera is everything that you would expect from a restaurant on Michigan Ave. Bandera is trendy, busy, pricey, and you are guaranteed to wait an extended period of time no matter the day of the week. From the moment I walked into Bandera I was in love with the overall vibe and decor of the place. The hostess was very knowledgeable and gave us a little history on all of the artwork in restaurant while we waited for a table. The wait time on the Sunday evening we went was roughly 45 minutes but with the bar packed we just had to awkwardly stand around. I would love to see a place like Bandera have a larger bar area. Once we got a table everything that followed was fantastic. The pianist had just returned once we got to our table and played beautifully. Our waitress was friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be at work. The food is indeed pricey but so delicious. Everyone at my table had great things to say about everything they ordered. If you decide to visit Bandera you have to try one of the desserts. I had the chance to try the House-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwich.

Its dim lighted, but enough lighting where you can see the other person you are talking to. I love that there is live jazz playing , its loud enough that you can hear it , but not too loud where you can&#39;t have a conversation without yelling at the other person. Its just right, but I guess that would also be dependent on where you sit in the restaurant. Food: Started off with the iron skillet jalepeno cheddar cornbread. Not like any cornbread I&#39;ve had. Nice texture, not too spicy and not too much cheese.. For the main course I had the emerald kale and roasted chicken salad that had what seemed to be a vinaigrette and pine nuts. Simple, but delicious as well. Its not too heavy , but not too light. The whole serving will definitely get you full. Dessert got the banana cream pie. I believe it was homemade, doesn&#39;t look like something you&#39;d get from Baker&#39;s Square. The cream was thick like a custard and the crust was thicker than a traditional graham cracker crust. Needless to say it was yummy. Service: You can reservations online, always a plus. Got seated on time and our server was very attentive and nice. All around great experience.

I had dinner with my best friend and his family just before attending a concert which we were all in town for.We had dinner reservations at 7 and arrived 20 minutes early. We were seated promptly. Unofficially, we were celebrating, so my friend selected a fancy restaurant nearby. Steadfast certainly exudes class. The dining rooms, the bar, the kitchen behind glass  and the staff are very elegant. Our server was knowledgeable and extremely friendly. And then the kitchen let her down.There was a three course meal option featured separately from the regular menu. Our server assured us we would be out in plenty of time for the 9:00 concert. All four of us decided to try the three course option. Plus, I enjoyed an Outlaw IPA by Two Brothers, which I had just tasted for the first time, last week in Scottsdale.Everyone was tempted by the bread (appetizer) option, and so it was ordered. It arrived quickly and disappeared very quickly as well. The butter and olive oil options paired well with the variety of bread options.Everything that followed was unfortunate. Only half of the  first course came out. My Laminated Brioche was excellent. But the Grilled Kale Salads did not show up. Our server checked back twice and each time, they had still not been delivered. What the hell?!? Half of our party waited for 20 mins for freaking salads!We were told the entrees would be out soon, yet still, we all waited for these. Three entrees were delivered. And thats when our server explained that the Ratatouille was a misprint and shouldn&#39;t have been on the menu. However, the kitchen managed to produce one plate for my friend&#39;s son. He was very pleased and enjoyed his dinner. As we all did. My Beef Filets were deliciously seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium rare.Desert was on the horizon and we were really getting concerned about timing. Fortunately, it was brought out promptly and all together. My rosemary Creme Br’_l’©e was the best example of this desert I&#39;ve ever tried.We finished dinner and were cashed out by 8:30. Unfortunately, we never received an explanation or much of an apology. And they certainly didn&#39;t comp anything on the check.

The breads were good but a bit small, so you&#39;ll definitely have a lot of leftover butter and oil after you&#39;re done eating. Our table also ordered the seared scallops with pea puree, which was delightfully fresh, and the filet mignon (2 6 oz. pieces), which came with a side of mashed potatoes, which were creamy, whipped and smooth.  For dessert, i&#39;d definitely recommend the butterscotch!  The butterscotch sorbet is smooth and refreshing on a warm summer day and complemented by the stout cake and nuts.  The carrot dessert was a bit of a let down for our table.

The service delays weren&#39;t entirely the fault of the staff (who were very friendly and knowledgeable) as they were dealing with a couple of parties of 5-8 gentlemen who reeked of pretense and in addition to being verbally and visibly demanding, were borderline rude to the staff.

steadfast-chicago-2,Erick N.,zH3dt6CdiHIvmfsDHcqTpA,a5ib_Hyimigsg_nR3NrXGQ,"Overall a very nice dinner; Chicago has been blessed with several wonderful new dining options of late and Steadfast definitely belongs on that list. The space itself is beautiful; especially the stunning bar area, but two tweaks could make it more comfortable - especially at this pricepoint: The two tops in some sections of the venue are tightly spaced and the chairs without the cushioned back might be the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever encountered in a dining venue - those need to be replaced STAT. Service was excellent; warm, personable, attentive and solid knowledge of a complex menu for a new venue. I appreciated that no attempts were made to oversell (our server advised we had over ordered) and the pacing was perfect with dishes coursed out individually or in pairs depending on how well they complimented one another, place settings refreshed between courses and neither a rushed nor tediously slow experience. The beverage program is excellent; super talented bartenders. The food was mostly good with the squid dish (fideo) being the highlight (and the fried chicken skins and the Flamiche from the bread service also deserving mention). Only miss out of a half dozen savories was the bone-in filet of beef; not terrible, but surprisingly dry for prime beef and over-seasoned for my palate. Overall the meal was a good value considering portion sizes and creativity and quality of the the dishes; the menu is tantalizing with lots of great sounding options. Desserts were not quite on par overall with the savories which was surprising as I have greatly enjoyed the pastry chef&#39;s work at previous venues; the description of the butterscotch dessert sounded amazing, but was far more a chocolate than butterscotch centric dish (I could barely detect any butterscotch flavor in the ice cream). Likewise a dessert titled honey, while decent, also featured other flavors far more prominent than honey. Mignardises helped male up for this though, several delicious treats to end the dinner on a positive note.",226,4,3,5,64,7.436700000000001,3.0900000000000003,0.253,7.659,No

The wine list is amazing. The wine list is exciting (major bonus points for having orange wine!).Gougere was absolutely delicious. Imagine herbed goat cheese in a lemony, graham cracker like crust with truffles on top.I&#39;m not a fan of fried chicken, but the fried chicken skins were a tasty little treat and the home made sriracha was so good.Scallops and foie gras is an amazing combination. The only downside is that I don&#39;t think two scallops is enough to be a medium sized plate.The butterscotch dessert with chocolate stout cake was good, but the rhubarb dessert was amazing! Panna cotta, rhubarb sorbet, pistachio, raspberries--there are so many flavors going on in one dish, but they&#39;re all so light and fresh that it makes the perfect summer dessert.After dessert, we were give a plate of that day&#39;s petit fours.

Pretty much everything that was on the menu when they opened is no longer there and replaced by items not quite as well.  It&#39;s also difficult when you are looking for consistency when it changes so often.  My favorite items, the chicken skins and oxtail croquettes, both have since been replaced with other items.  They don&#39;t really have any go-to items for lunch such as a Caesar salad or something (albeit plain vanilla) everyday.

We had a 12:15 lunch reservation and were seated immediately. It then took approximately 10 minutes for our server to stop by for drink orders (2 iced teas) and a while after that for lunch orders. We each had a salad - she had the grilled kale and I had the speckled salad - both of us added chicken. We also ordered the bread basket (which was delicious) along with the accompanying condiments. The salad portions were &#34;small&#34; (they were listed as appetizers).  There wasn&#39;t a lot of chicken - but it was flavorful. The bread and butter/oil, etc. was delicious. A guy (not our server - maybe a manager) topped off my iced tea but didn&#39;t top off Kim&#39;s.  He came back just as we were about to leave and asked her if she wanted more tea. Overall - our service was below par for a weekday lunch in the loop. The noise level is deafening. Maybe we should let them know we are on a lunch &#34;hour&#34; and not leisurely guests.

I realized that &#34;fast&#34; may not be their strength, but their service and food presentations are detail-oriented.  Whenever I have time I would come on Saturdays with hubby, so there&#39;s no traffic coming from people working in the building where &#34;Ge Pa De Caffe&#34; is attached to.

I bought one of the $10 certificate to give it a try.  I&#39;m personally not that crazy about visiting downtown since this part of city is touristy and constantly crowded with working professionals and visitors.

ge-pa-de-caffe-chicago-3,Jon L.,C4oRZgWSphGDSt2SiORC3g,NoBASyglh-ypPe_c74_JFA,"When I was in Chicago this summer, I decided that I would eat out at as many different places as possible to experience the breadth of food the city had to offer. My rule was simple: Don&#39;t visit any place more than twice. In 10 weeks, I managed to try foods from over 130 different establishments, all but one of which I was able to follow my two-visit rule for. The lone outlier? I visited Ge Pa De TEN times. Every visit was nothing but a quality experience that compelled me to come back again.  Food: The food here is nothing but pure class. Everything is made and presented with care and I&#39;ve never eaten anything that didn&#39;t look or taste fresh. I recommend any of their salads, which are the largest I&#39;ve ever seen. I also recommend any of their pastries; my personal favorites are the almond nutella croissant, nutella crepe, and chocolate lava cake (see photos). The only foods I&#39;ve tried here that I wouldn&#39;t really recommend are the sandwiches/paninis, not because they aren&#39;t good but because they&#39;re relatively mediocre compared to the other menu items Ge Pa De serves.Gelato:  I&#39;ve decided to create a separate section just for the gelato because it&#39;s in a class of its own - hands down the best I&#39;ve had in Chicago. It&#39;s so fresh and they rotate flavors every few days so they always have a bunch of new and interesting flavors. The best part is they encourage you to sample as many of their flavors as you want to help you decide which one you like most. I&#39;ve probably bought about eight of their flavors and sampled well over a dozen and every single one has had incredibly rich flavor and magical consistency. From their sweet flavors to their tart ones, Ge Pa De has every flavor nailed to the highest standard. My personal favorites are probably the straciatella nougat and the sour black cherry but I definitely recommend you sample the flavors yourself to decide.Service: The staff has never been anything but helpful and patient; in my ten visits here, I&#39;ve never met a single staff member who showed even a glimpse of impatience or attitude. Service is usually very quick (less than 10 minutes). On many occasions Domenico, the owner, will personally serve you your food and check up on you for feedback.Being from New York and having lived in the Loop for ten weeks, I&#39;ve seen my fair share of caf’©s; Ge Pa De Caffe is without question the best I&#39;ve been to in my lifetime. For the very cheap prices, the quantity of the food is already very impressive but it&#39;s the photo-worthy, meticulously-prepared quality that blows me away.

Let the story begin. I thought the sandwich wasn&#39;t anything special. Would&#39;ve preferred a stronger taste of pesto, and definitely could&#39;ve done WITHOUT the pickles. Thought they were too jarringly sour and didn&#39;t mix well with the rest of the sandwich. The nutella latte was sublime, and I was sad I only got two gulps of it before my partner finished the rest. Then comes the gelato. I had super high expectations and hopes for this as I read rave Yelp reviews on the owner&#39;s magic with his self-made gelato. The waitress was accommodating enough to put up with my many requests (around 5) to try different flavors. They were all good in those little samplers. I ordered a double scoop of hazelnut and raspberry (mixed with white chocolate and I forgot what else), and was super excited to devour it. It was embellished with two cookies on top. BUT THEN I FOUND A STRAND OF HAIR! Mind you, I always come across these back home in Thailand where people don&#39;t really care, but I expected better from an American establishment. I would&#39;ve carried on eating the gelato anyway after taking out the hair, only to realize it was really long and was lodged deep within my gelato. Lol. I went to the counter - I wasn&#39;t upset at all at this point, merely wanted it replaced - and encountered no problems with my request. However, when I received the replaced gelato the same waitress had given me pistachio instead of hazelnut, which my partner and I hadn&#39;t really liked during the samplers. This didn&#39;t go well with the raspberry, which made the combination too sweet for us. She also did not care to apologize or say a word when handing me the second gelato replacement.The only redeeming part of the gelato experience was that the other waitress behind the counter personally came over to our table to fully refund our gelato order in cash. She was great. I would still give this place another chance because of its nutella latte and drop in for a gelato, though.",236,3,3,3,78,2.3939,3.5510000000000006,1.328,19.121,No

ge-pa-de-caffe-chicago-3,Jennifer L.,lP2MfGE563YD6tD_egSZYw,SrdBEpJUGuh46IP-zewP3g,"As a downtown office worker bee, I&#39;ve found it a very nice perk to have a great restaurant in the building.  Let&#39;s be real.  Being economical and packing a lunch every single day gets boring after a while.  Sometimes, you want to escape the confines of your office/cube.  However, in inclement weather, having something in the building is always a plus.I found a deal on Groupon for 2 $10 Groupons for $11 so I quickly bought that.  I believe the deal is still running so you may want to double check Groupon for it.  It&#39;s always nice to save a little where you can.I came in around 1:15 on both trips and it wasn&#39;t too busy.  I&#39;m a late luncher anyway and like to avoid the crowds that go around noon.  I ordered the Bella Italia panini, which came with salami, parmesan, tomatoes, lettuce, onions on warm, chewy ciabatta bread.  It came with an olive oil spread and was drizzled with oregano.  It was also served with a pepper topenada, which gave it a nice kick.  The sandwich was delicious and the ingredients tasted very fresh.  The portion is also very filling and I could have easily eaten only half.I have also tried two of their soups, tomato basil and minestrone, which were both good.  They were served with a packet of saltine crackers.On my second visit, I got a free packaged tiramisu cake.  On the first visit, I didn&#39;t get anything.  I spoke to my co-workers who had dined there before and they said this happens and it really isn&#39;t consistent as to whether you will get something free or not.  Either way, no big deal in my book.I only had to pay $2.02 for my meal after using the Groupon, which makes it a great deal in my book.Since my lunch trips, I&#39;ve stopped by to try an espresso beverage.  They serve Illy coffee here.  I ordered a soy vanilla latte, which came out to under $4.  I don&#39;t believe I was charged extra for soy, which was nice.  Keep in mind that they do charge you a little more to take your beverage to go.They also serve gelato and you can see the wheel right when you walk up to the counter to place your order.  A co-worker told me that she got addicted to it and was eating it every day.  So, it&#39;s probably dangerous.  I do plan to try it at least one.  Luckily, I&#39;m not obsessed with gelato so hopefully I won&#39;t get addicted.The only improvement I can suggest is that the employees be a tad bit friendlier and keep their personal conversations in the back room and not behind the counter.I&#39;ll definitely be back.

Unlike cafes and coffeehouses where coffee prices are based on the size of the drink, GPDC&#39;s price structure depends on whether you order the drink for here or to go (takeout/carry-out). There is a 70 cent price difference between having your coffee to go v. for here. Surprisingly, getting it to go is more expensive. I was back at GPDC to order the same grilled chicken pesto sandwich that made me a GPDC fan in the first place. Surprisingly, the panini came with two sides: potato chips and pasta salad (tri-color spiral pasta, olives). It was a late lunch, so I decided to get my caffeine fix then. I ordered the nutella cappuccino. The warm drink came with a generous foam that was dotted by the nutella flavoring. It was excellent. The drink was well-crafted, and just the right size.

I had recalled reading a friend&#39;s Yelp review of Ge Pa De and when I saw on my Yelp app that it was so close to the symphony, I made my decision to come here immediately. There was ample seating, although I couldn&#39;t find anywhere available with an outlet. There were two people at either end camped out with their laptops (and I can&#39;t blame them because I would absolutely covet an outlet like that, too)! I ordered a plain latte even though I was incredibly tempted to try the nutella latte. However, I was strong and decided to continue adhering to my Lenten promise of giving up sweets. I asked what the &#34;table&#34; price meant on the displayed menu because those prices were cheaper than the small, medium, large options in a takeaway cup. It turns out it&#39;s cheaper if you order your drink to be consumed there. Score! I always prefer savoring my drink from a mug if it&#39;s at all possible. My drink arrived on a cute board with a napkin and little cookie. What a thoughtful touch! The latte was frothy, soft, creamy, and delicious. It&#39;s definitely one of the better lattes I&#39;ve ever had. The service was really great and friendly. I delighted in enjoying my latte as I read a book. The atmosphere was laid-back with people kicking back with a drink for a chat with friends or coworkers. I will absolutely be back here to try the gelato and paninis in the future.

It was a big sandwich for the price and it came with a little chocolate Italian dessert. What made me think this place might be worth a second try was the customer service. A woman ordered a sandwich before I came in and they forgot to put meat on it. She came back and they remade her sandwich and then gave her a gift card for a free lunch. The owner came out and was very nice about the situation.So, the next day a coworker and I stopped in for breakfast. We both had the pepper and egg sandwich. It was amazing. The owner himself came out and gave us our sandwiches then came back out once we&#39;d finished to make sure we liked them.

I let him know that the order was incorrect and he apologized and took the sandwich to the back. Without hesitation, the owner came out and greeted me. He apologized for the inconvenience and asked me if I wanted a dessert, pastry, or drink on GePaDe to make up for it. I ended up getting two scoops of handmade gelato made that morning for free.

The owner is frequently there and takes great pride in producing the gelato which is definitely on my short list of best gelato I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;ve yet to try the made to order cannolis but have heard they&#39;re just as good.If you&#39;re not in a hurry and you&#39;re okay with waiting then this is definitely a 5 star location but even ordering a toasted bagel with cream cheese can take up to 10+ minutes sometimes and when I need to get back to work I can&#39;t afford to take a 30 minute break just to get a bite to eat. I&#39;ve stopped ordering anything that needs to be cooked in the mornings and instead just get their coffee and something from their selection of pre-prepared foods.Amazing things (pros)- Illy Coffee- Egg sandwiches (real eggs)- Gelato (the owner makes it himself)- All the food is actually very good and properly pricedThe deal breakers (cons)- The wait times for anything sent to the kitchen can be long.

Having a drink while here at the brewpub made me once again appreciate the foothold that this brewery has in the industry.  The beer really is good, but like I said - it&#39;s even better here.  I was shocked by how many beers they had listed on the menu, especially because you see about a fourth of that selection at any Binny&#39;s or liquor store.  Actually, I had never even heard of half the beers listed on their menu.  Many of the beers were variations of pale ales and IPA&#39;s (of course), but there was a good selection of Hefeweizen&#39;s!  Personally, I opted for the Chicago Smoke which was an appropriately named smoked Hefeweizen.  If you like peat like me and my fianc’© do then you&#39;d love this beer, but if not then you definitely won&#39;t.  It&#39;s one of those beers where you either love it or you hate it.  I loved it.  My fianc’© got a sample of the Office Supplies and a pint of another one (yikes, I can&#39;t remember - all that beer is killing my brain cells!!!) but he loved it all the same.  For a sample, its $2, but it&#39;s basically a double shot of beer so that&#39;s a good deal.  However, if you want just a taste of one its free (as it usually is).  Because my fianc’© and I weren&#39;t looking for much other than beer we decided to go for the Bavarian pretzel with the beer cheese fondue.  We can never turn down a good pretzel, and good this pretzel was.  First - I have to say this: that pretzel was FLUFFY!  And that beer cheese was overly addicting.  We raved about that pretzel and cheese for hours after consuming it.  Though we didn&#39;t order any other food, it all smelled and looked delicious...but then again I&#39;m a sucker for good brewpub food.  I&#39;d come back again to try some of their other food, but as others have said - I would prefer to go back during the weekend so that I could get a tour.I wish I would have been able to go on a tour, but it was neat that when sitting at the bar we were able to look into the brewery itself, seeing them hard at work.  For some reason, I was sitting there, watching them brew the beer and it amazed me that human hands make such yummy beer!!  Don&#39;t ask - I get philosophical when I&#39;m buzzed, okay?  As for the brewpub itself, I liked it but it seemed somewhat dull in comparison to the Three Floyds Brewery which I am used to.  Obviously, that&#39;s like comparing apples and oranges so I will stop before I put my foot in my mouth.  This brewpub is great and they sell awesome merchandise near the bar...actually it&#39;s right to the left of when you walk in the door.  Ultimately, it&#39;s got everything a reputable brewpub should have - great beer, good food, awesome scenery (the brewery itself), merchandise and good service.",345,5,3,5,58,7.2357000000000005,5.099000000000001,1.307,24.594,No

This pub deserves the praise that it gets for both their beers, and their food.  Since they don&#39;t accept reservations, prepare to wait, or come at a very off time of the day.  Considering the fact that one of their most popular appetizers is bacon fat popcorn, this is not the place to come if you are dieting.  Almost every food dish is decadent.  Most of the beers are available to purchase in sample sizes to try  This is ideal for someone that would rather try small amounts of different types of beers and not get stuck with one they hate.  I like the fact that this restaurant puts their own spin their menu items. The only appetizer I&#39;ve had here was the bacon fat popcorn, and it was just as delicious as it sounds. I&#39;ve had both the hombre burger, and the roasted tomato pizza here.  The burger was good, but I liked the roasted tomato pizza even better.  The ingredients on this pizza went well together, and I had enough for left overs. The service is okay here, but the waiters have not been that attentive.

The hardcore and IDGAF vibe didn&#39;t sit well with me from the moment I walked in. The staff members really didn&#39;t seem to care about providing friendly and professional service, but maybe that&#39;s their culture. REVOLUTION!!!!There was a pretty good selection of beer, though it took forever to get any of our drinks, because the place was so huge and understaffed. Or everyone is just slow. Same went for our food. My boyfriend and I ordered a few items, including french fries, calamari, and burnt ends. By the time they reached out table, I forgot I even ordered them. The fries and calamari were not my favorite, but I actually really liked the burned ends, which consists of twice-smoked brisket and BBQ baked beans on top of Texas toast. Amazing.In the end, I would have been better off ordering Revolution beer from a halfway-decent restaurant or purchasing bottles from the store for at-home consumption. After several interactions with our waiter and other staff members, I couldn&#39;t wait to get home. No one seemed like they enjoyed working there -- why would anyone want to be served by people like that? Great beer but poor experience at the actual brewery.

It had sauteed shrimp, cheesy grits, and bacon-sweet corn succotash. I love me some cheesy grits, and coupled with shrimp (I never would have thought of this combo) it was absolutely delicious.

It&#39;s conveniently near a blue line stop, so it fit in very well with our plan to have some beer before hopping back on the train to go to O&#39;Hare. We were lucky to snag a table for 3 at once in the drinks-only area, since you aren&#39;t seated at the regular tables unless you plan to dine as well.The beer is really solid. I had two pints of Chicago Smoke, which is a Germany-style rauchbier. It&#39;s a style of beer that I love and very rarely see in American breweries, so I&#39;m all over it whenever I do see it. Chicago Smoke certainly delivered on this front.My only complaint was that it took a really long time for a server to take our order--we actually ended up having to flag someone down because after waiting for ~15 minutes. That was disappointing, because it meant I had to spend 15 minutes in a brewery without a pint in front of me. Questionable service aside, I&#39;d definitely come back here for the beer.

Read at your own risk.Just when you start to think that you&#39;ve left horrible, complacent service behind, in walks Revolution Brewing Company. My wife and I were in town to see The Cure and we were looking for something to do that was both local and craft-beer related. OK, so that last part was all me, but still. It was about 6pm on a Saturday.As soon as we got to the area, we knew this was probably not the best idea. For you see, the day of our visit coincided with some sort of neighborhood art fair that just happened to be going on right in front of the brewery. Basically, this meant that there was probably about 10X as many people as would have been there on a &#34;typical&#34; Saturday afternoon. We were unswayed.Upon entering we were immediately accosted by two things - throngs of people and a thick, immutable wall of noise, my god the noise. This place was equal parts Tokyo subway car and room full of running blenders filled with nuts and bolts. The hostess informed us that it would be about a 35 minute wait. Banking on this being a bit of a cushioned number, we opted to wait it out. We got lucky. The wait was only about 10 minutes. As soon as we sat down we knew there was no way a conversation would be possible. It was insanely loud. People shouting to be heard and then shouting over the shouts. I think you get the picture. We were relegated to hand signs and texts.Things started off well enough. Our server came over, took our drink orders, brought waters, etc, etc. When she returned with my beer we put in our order - house pretzel, burnt ends, &amp; a Workingman Burger. Simple enough, right. Apparently not. Within about 15 minutes our apps arrived. The soft pretzel was delicious. Soft, warm and with a slightly sweet/sourdough-ish flavor that I really dug. The beer cheddar fondue was stellar. The burnt ends was a hot mess and not in a good way. Actually, it was sort of an insult to real burnt ends. A plate full of charred fat cubes set atop a piece of white bread covered in a tablespoon of undercooked baked beans. Nope. Not even close. Here&#39;s where things dove head-first into the black hole of service, never to escape its immense gravitational pull.I had finished my beer at this point, my wife her iced tea, and we started to wait. 10 minutes. 15 minutes. 25 minutes. When we reached the 40 minute mark and there was no sign of our server or our burger, we got a bit testy. Apparently, our server was now enamored with a table of 6 and had decided that we no longer required her attention. She never stopped back in to check on us once. I sat with empty beer glass for nearly 30 minutes. Finally, my wife stood up and flagged down another server and informed him that we had to get going. You know, the concert I mentioned earlier? He went to find our server and, whaddya know, she managed to extricate herself from the aforementioned large party long enough to stop by our table,&#34;I&#39;m so sorry, I have no idea why your burger is taking so long. The kitchen said it&#39;d be about 5 minutes or so. Will you wait?&#34; A smile hid the mental reality - We&#39;ve been waiting for about 45 minutes now. Hell, no. We asked for the check and while we sat waiting for our bill, a manager came over. More apologies,&#34;So you had some trouble with your meal? I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll go ahead and take off the burger.&#34; Thanks, you mean the burger we never even saw? How generous of you. How about comping the entire bill. That would have been the right thing to do. Whatever. We knew that was all we were going to get out of this place so we paid up and got the hell outta Dodge. Ugh. I left annoyed with a very irritated wife and a 35 minute drive in Chicago traffic ahead of us.This is probably only the 3rd or 4th time in my life I didn&#39;t leave a tip. She earned every penny.I can hear it now, &#34;It was just unusually busy&#34;, &#34;We did our best&#34;, &#34;It was beyond our control&#34;. I get it, sometimes even the best establishments falter, but that shouldn&#39;t stop them from going above and beyond when a customer has clearly been hosed. Yeah, it&#39;s really a one-star experience. I begrudgingly tossed in the extra star because the beer I had was actually quite tasty.Damn, I&#39;m still irritated.",518,2,1,-3,-85,-3.4186999999999994,4.258,6.734,59.007,No
revolution-brewing-chicago,Hollyann H.,EThuV-sNxhvyJ0ajHK1qWQ,wfHXME8br6NLdViIGnPIIg,"Sunday morning, we roll into Chicago from Cincinnati and the first place we had planned to stop was Revolution Brewing. The first thing I notice is how unique and cool the neighborhood where it is located is. Revolution Brewery is located in the neighborhood of Logan Square. Art galleries, Independent shops, and graffiti everywhere. Very artsy, hip neighborhood. We parked on the street where free parking was off one of the side streets from the brewery. For Chicago, the parking was easy. That was a plus. It&#39;s also extremely walkable. This is Revolutions...basically, Brew Pub and their tap room/brewery is down the street. We go into the restaurant, it&#39;s a large space and it&#39;s packed. I noticed that it wasn&#39;t just people in their twenties like I would have assumed walking into a Brew-Pub. There were lots of families with their kids, and I thought that was cool. We get a two seater table. It was a little tight fit. Every time I had to get up to go to the bathroom, I had to try and not knock everything off our table while attempting not to stick my butt on the table next to us. I wasn&#39;t thrilled about the seating situation but it wasn&#39;t a big deal. It took probably five minutes for our server to even come over and introduce herself and take our drink orders, and when she did her personality was non-existent. To make things worse with our server, it was so loud because so many people were there that we couldn&#39;t really talk to her to ask about menu items. Luckily, all of our food that we ordered turned out awesome. It was Sunday morning so they had their brunch menu and their normal menu. Dan and I both ended up ordering from the brunch menu. Dan ordered the Brisket Omelet and I ordered the Breakfast From Scratch. Dan&#39;s Brisket Omelet was SO good. My Breakfast From Scratch was just alright. I should have got something crazier, but I didn&#39;t. I also ordered the sausage with my meal, and I regretted that. I have a weird thing with texture when I&#39;m eating and I was thinking sausage links. It was just one big thick sausage. I ended up not even eating it. So my suggestion with the food is try something unique and different. Don&#39;t just settle for the eggs and toast. They had lots of amazing sounding items on both the brunch and the normal menu that I hope to try next time we go back. A huge selection of their beer on tap, and if you haven&#39;t had it before, it&#39;s a must. The service from our server was just horrible, but the two girls who were at the host stand were super nice when we were leaving and buying a shirt. They even let me bug them ask them questions about cool places around the neighborhood. If you love food and craft beer I would defiantly make this a priority on your stop in Chicago.",293,4,1,5,-28,5.064299999999999,3.4050000000000007,1.012,32.583,No

You can go by the glass or make your own beer flight for which I did both. Entrees that we had were the chilaquiles which my wife seems to try everywhere. She said they were very good and couldn&#39;t compare to other places simply because they were made different than at most places, I tried them and it&#39;s true but they are really good and it&#39;s a must try. I had the vegetarian wrap which was also very good, the addition of the habanero hot sauce put the wrap into another taste dimension.  Overall this place is worthy of a return to try various other things on the menu and different beers.

revolution-brewing-chicago,Anna P.,oWkB3fAIHWZ1SPZ6qCsgtg,NL_VZSGd8HSw0Nqv8HUkyA,"Love this place!  Tons of awesome beers and upscale pub food in a cool atmosphere, how can you go wrong?  Came in for a late lunch on a Sunday and had no problem getting a table, though they were closing early at 4 for a staff party, so that could have made it less busy.  Either way, the service was nice and attentive, but didn&#39;t rush us out given that they were having their xmas party later and probably wanted to finish up their tables, so that was really nice.Most of their beers here are pretty hoppy, so if that&#39;s your jam you&#39;ll love it here.  I&#39;m not always a fan of beers that are too hoppy, but there are still quite a few other options here that I really like.  Started with A Little Crazy, which is a nice easy drinking beer that you can find on tap at other bars across Chicago.  Also tried something new with the Cross of Gold, which was also light and easy to drink.  We also just had a little taste of the Executive Order... yowser order a full size of this at your own risk.  I think it was over 11% and it tasted STRONG, almost like port wine...don&#39;t think I could ever handle a full glass of this.On Sunday afternoon they were serving from their brunch menu and lunch menu, though I&#39;d say the brunch here is a little more lunchy than breakfasty.  We started with the bacon popcorn since that seems to be all the rage, but honestly, I wasn&#39;t blown away by this.  I felt like it could have used a little salt, and all the popcorn at the bottom of the bowl was in a pool of grease so just not that appetizing.  But we also had the pretzel, which was awesome.  Soft and yummy with this really tasty beer cheese sauce, sooo good.  We all really loved our lunches as well, I had the steak salad, which looked super simple, but the steak was so well seasoned and cooked and the citrus dressing with it was awesome.  The rest of my fam had a couple of the burgers and the biscuits and gravy and everyone loved their dishes.If you&#39;re in the mood for a great beer selection and awesome pub food, this is your place!",226,5,3,5,66,9.097000000000001,4.274,0.612,13.115,No

I mean sure, I love their beer, but who knew they had such a delectable food menu to go with it? Turns out plenty of other Yelpers and I&#39;m just late to the party. Better late than never right?My friend Alison T. decided to start her day of birthday celebrations with some great crafty beer here at the Rev. I took the train in from suburbia and got there about 20 minutes earlier than my friends (which never happens as I am notoriously late). They don&#39;t take reservations (to my knowledge), but I was able to put our name in for a table. I popped a squat up at the bar and perused the beer menu. I ordered the Citra Hero which is a part of their hero series beer. A great choice indeed, because this is now my favorite Revolution beer! It&#39;s an elegant beer that showcases citrus hops. Yum! A great choice in the summer when drinking beer at 10:30 in the morning. Just sayin...As I waited for my friends I continued to see delicious food come out. Now I&#39;m curious. I took a peak at the menu and was blown away. Not only did they have an enticing lunch menu, but a brunch and specials menu as well! Boom. Not sure why I assumed it was just a small bar food menu. Fail on my part.Regardless, couldn&#39;t have been more excited to dive into brunch and booze when my friends arrived. We ordered the bacon fat popcorn and soft pretzel to start. While the bacon popcorn was inventive (and I definitely love bacon), I was kind of disappointed. I thought it would have more of a bacon flavor when in reality it just had some bacon pieces mixed in. Now typically I&#39;m not a huge soft pretzel fanatic, but this one is worth ordering! It&#39;s the perfect texture, not too salty, and their beer cheese sauce is to die for.Onward with my meal... I went with the Egg in a Hole, which is two organic eggs in brioche baskets, beer-cheese sauce (same as previously mentioned), breakfast potatoes, and bacon. Holy carb overload! Don&#39;t get me wrong, those potatoes and bacon were pretty bomb, but the egg was pretty much overpowered by the brioche bread. Again, delicious but not what I was expecting.In the end, the beer comes in hard with the win. They have such an extensive list and the bartender was super knowledgeable with what they have to offer. I love that you can get 5 oz. samples for $3 which is what we ended up doing so we could taste test. I tried the Rosa which was really good (a seasonal hibiscus ale) and the infamous 1Zenuff imperial IPA. This sucker was 11% alcohol and dangerously delicious. Good thing I only had the 5 oz. glass (which is the only sampler that&#39;s a little bit more money than the others).Great job Revolution!

There were an ample amount of bacon bits and Parmesan cheese mixed in with the popcorn. I just wish the bacon was a tad bit more crispy. For my main dish I had the Smokestack Pizza which had every single meat possible on it. Okay, maybe not, but it felt like it. It had pulled pork, bacon, Italian sausage, and pepperoni. Fresh out of the oven this was hot, cheesy, meaty goodness. The crust however, was just a tad bit too chewy for my liking. It would have been perfect with just a crisper crust. The pizza is a good size definitely big enough to share in my opinion, especially with all of the meat on top. They cut it into four slices and I was only able to finish one. The leftovers the next two days were great! =)Overall, I really liked this place and will definitely be back.

In lieu of getting a couple main entrees, Jackie S and I decided to go the way of tapas-style lunch.  We gorged ourselves on:+ bacon fat popcorn -- this is easily their signature starter, with a light dusting of parmesan and delightful crispy sage pieces, not to mention a hearty portion of bacon crumbles.  If you plan on dining here, plan on getting this.  It&#39;s NOT TO BE MISSED.

Perfect choice when all you&#39;ve been doing is pouring beer down your gullet. [$6]+ &#34;burnt ends&#34; -- this smoked brisket dish came with baked beans and was served on Texas toast.  Even though it was pretty good, it was the weakest of the 4 items we got; I wouldn&#39;t be aching to get this on a return visit [$11]+ cauliflower gratin -- definitely the highlight of our meal, fashioned with smoked gouda (that&#39;s a gouda cheese!), Swiss chard, roasted garlic, and served with toasted baguette slices.  A triumph for your tastebuds.  [$9]Our server was pleasant and timely in clearing off our table of plates that had been damn near licked clean (my doing).  Unsurprisingly, their beer menu is packed to the gills with options ranging from lighter lagers to imperial stouts and quintuple-IPAs.  I once again got beer samples, 5oz pours of their &#39;Jukebox Hero&#39; (black IPA), &#39;Cross of Gold&#39; (golden ale), and the infamous &#39;Straight Jacket&#39; (strong, barrel-aged barleywine).  The samples are the ideal size for build-your-own flights and allow you to try a handful without getting too much of any 1 brew that you may or may not like.  FYI, drinking enough of the aptly-named &#39;straight jacket&#39; will likely put you in a place with padded walls, since it&#39;s 14% ABV.

revolution-brewing-chicago,Maynard L.,O2U7QCLeDEBA3K2w4qwAsQ,oNBXE7tirBWa0UnPj1FKVw,"Bae wanted to check out Revolution&#39;s brewpub, and even though I&#39;d been there more times than I could count, I couldn&#39;t resist another go. I love the aromas and scents germinating inside breweries like Revolution, whether at the Jameson distillery in Ireland, which I&#39;ve been to, or a German bierhaus during Oktoberfest (once in Berlin, once in Munich), the hops and wheat intoxicate me. I rank Chicago&#39;s top craft brewpubs as Revolution, Lagunitas, and Goose Island. Bae and I go with our friends Jagger and Bear, who just completed his Art of Clowning certification. It&#39;s just like regular clowning, only Bear never smiles, and none of it is funny.The brewpub is crowded most weeknights but we manage to get seated relatively quick. Our waitress arrives as soon as we&#39;re seated and offers us menus but quickly runs off instead of taking my beer order, which I already knew. Today the talk centers around Ta-Nehese Coates&#39; new book--which I haven&#39;t read; certain movie critics--who I have; the live soundtrack of Hamilton versus the studio version; how to do the Milly Rock dance; Bun B&#39;s reporting on the campaign trail; which festival has the better vibe--Coachella or Bonnaroo. When our waitress finally decides to reappear we order drinks. Jagger orders the Anti-Hero, which has a crisp bitterness, partly because of its blend of four different hops, and imparts a strong floral and citrus aroma. Bear gets a Paddy Wagon, an Irish stout that&#39;s classically brewed, smooth and exceedingly silky due to its nitro pour, though in my opinion the aroma is fairly nondescript. I order the A Little Crazy, and for Bae, since she usually orders something that comes in a martini glass and has a neon colored tint, I order her a Working Man, not entirely with my tongue in-cheek, because she already said she wants to order the chopped kale salad and the Working Man will pair well, given its light body and lively carbonation, finishing dry so that the taste doesn&#39;t linger.My favorite features of the pub are the wood grain bar, the barrel wood walls and stone dividers sectioning the eating area. Everyone, from the servers to the bartenders, is covered in some pretty cool ink, which is emblematic of the crowd that frequents Revolution, lots of tattoos and denim and beards. There is ample space between the wooden tables, a welcomed detail, though I still manage to overhear a mother and her ten year old son next to us. &#34;I think I cracked my phone screen,&#34; she says. &#34;It&#39;s your own damn fault,&#34; he responds.Our food arrives along with our second round. It would have been nice to get the beers first. Now they&#39;ll sit on the table as we eat. I was drinking the A Little Crazy strictly BECAUSE I wanted to enjoy the pale ale&#39;s tropical hops palate before the toasted barley character conflicted with my smoked pulled pork sandwich. Really dropped the ball, waitress. Now I have to eat my sandwich quicker than I&#39;d prefer. The pork is locally sourced, always butchered a week or two before being served, preserving its freshness. This ignites a discussion about preparing meals at home. &#34;I personally enjoy cooking,&#34; I say, &#34;and see a distinction between actual food as opposed to processed food, and yeah, even if it&#39;s from the frozen section at Trader Joe&#39;s or Whole Foods, it&#39;s processed.&#34; This is not groundbreaking news, but I&#39;m still the first one to say it. Bae says she cooks every day and cannot imagine anything wrong with that. Jagger finishes her Anti-Hero and says she just grilled fajita meat the other day and now she&#39;s going to grill NY strip steaks. I say sometimes me and Bae have one or two crock pots going at the same time so we&#39;ll have food for days. &#34;If you&#39;re smart about it,&#34; Bear says, &#34;like prepping food the night before or reusing things in different ways, it&#39;s not that difficult.&#34; I counter with, &#34;If it&#39;s important, that is.&#34; Scoring the scene is the deafening clang of utensils hitting plates, glasses being bussed, ice falling into pitchers. Jagger says if she&#39;s really on her game, she plans 2 weeks of menus in advance to maximize the ingredients she buys. Lies! Our waitress checks in on us and I immediately order a Fist City while staring at Jagger as she stuffs her face with a $13 veggie burger, but she doesn&#39;t notice.",530,4,2,5,19,6.0331,2.5819999999999994,1.859,31.558999999999997,No

I read an article showing 10 traits of a successful city in the March 2016 edition of The Atlantic, and the last one was &#34;If the city has a brewery, it will be successful.&#34; Chicago is swamped with breweries. So-called &#39;craft&#39; breweries are so mainstream now, including Revolution. Hell, I&#39;ve seen beer from Revolution in Vienna. But, when you&#39;re eating and drinking at the Logan Square location, it does feel local. (Check out my review of Hopewell Brewing Co., a welcome addition to Logan Square.)Their menu is seasonal, but lately it hasn&#39;t been. Actually, I&#39;ve been disappointed in their offerings lately because their Fall and Winter menus have appeared almost identical, especially in the entr’©e offerings. I really enjoyed a flank steak dish they had in the summer, only to not see some sort of steak rendition available for the past several months. But, I&#39;m confident this will change with the coming months.Lately, I&#39;ve been ordering their skirt steak salad. It activates everything I want in a meal: the unmatched, rich flavor of skirt steak--people should eat more of this; a tangy garlic-based dressing; peppery arugula, which I always think is a suitable civil union with cuts of beef; shaved parmesan, because why not. I&#39;ve tried to replicate this at home without any measure of success. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because I really can&#39;t, or I just want to lie to myself so I can keep ordering this dish.This IS the place you want to take any visitor coming to Chicago. It will appease almost any appetite, and the quality of the food is better than your average brewpub. I can&#39;t recommend the pretzels, popcorn, and wings enough. It&#39;s classic bar food, just elevated at a level that would win most Tinder dates over. It&#39;s great for a date, if you can get a seat on the weekends.In my usual advocacy for public transportation, take the Blue Line to California to reach Revolution. Thank me when you realize that, no, you won&#39;t be able to operate a motor vehicle after your visit.",304,4,3,5,64,7.072400000000001,4.93,1.084,24.986000000000004,No

Though, bacon is never lame, especially not the bacon here. The egg in the hole or whatever breakfast I got was super good and came with a ridiculous amount of the beer cheese sauce that accompanies their house pretzel.

We are HUGE Revolution fans but a few things, good and bad, stuck out to me last night and I figure it&#39;s post worthy.Good: When we arrived and put our names down with the hostess, they quoted us a 1hr wait time which wasn&#39;t a problem. We were able to grab a beer at the bar it was only 30mins before we were actually seated. Eh: We were seated next to the front windows in front of the stairs leading upstairs. The chill that kept coming from the front door and the single pane, retractable windows was pretty noticeable and had an impact on our experience. I&#39;m going to let this slide with an &#34;Eh&#34; though because: 1) We are Chicagoans and it was 15 degrees outside in the middle of February 2) The front windows are retractable which is a huge plus in the summer.Bad: I was excited to order the Mushroom Polenta but the entree itself was a flop. While beautifully presented, it was simply void of flavor. More of a tasteless gruel than hearty polenta.The Best: Our waitress asked if there was something wrong with it after my few nibbles. I explained to her that I wasn&#39;t a fan of the polenta but not to worry because I finished our tasty appetizer (burnt ends). She offered to take it off the bill. I refused, she relented. When the bill came, the polenta charge was zeroed out.I didn&#39;t have a problem paying for food that I ordered. It wasn&#39;t like it was prepared wrong or spoiled. I just, personally, wasn&#39;t a fan. They should have kept it on the bill.

We were able to snag a table for our group of four.  It was so nice to not have to stand in the crowded downstairs.

Both are made in House and both are delish. I liked putting the pickles on the chips too, so tasty! The chips had a little kick, from the house made spice they use on them. But paired with the sweet pickles, it&#39;s a perfect match.  For apps we had fried green tomatoes and shrimp and grits. I&#39;ve never had FGT before, but let&#39;s just say my first time won&#39;t be me last!! The shrimp and grits were very good, they don&#39;t skimp on the shrimp! I&#39;ll be honest, I have had better, but only at ONE place, also in the city. To be a solid #2 is ok in my book though. We also had corn bread that we had come out with our meals. The corn bread is so good that I had to give it its own paragraph! It&#39;s a huge, moist, sweet but not too sweet, hint of honey, buttery goodness. The butter they give you is honey butter too. OMG, soooo good. You can&#39;t not get the corn bread. For our meals, he got a rack of competition ribs, my mom got the brisket, and I got a pulled pork sandwich. His ribs were amazing ..some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Meat falling off the bone goodness. I forgot to mention, they give you 4 different sauces for every meal....mild &amp; spicy bbq sauce, South Carolina mustard, and a North Carolina vinegar sauce with mustard seed. My moms brisket was very tasty. They cooked it just right. She did say that she was spoiled after she had a rib from my BF&#39;s plate and wished she had just gotten the ribs. She still liked the brisket, but just had buyers remorse after eating the ribs. My sandwich was awesome. Tons of meat on a pretzel roll. We didn&#39;t have room for desert because we all had left overs.

If you pay/tip by card, it all goes into their paycheck which comes every two weeks. I&#39;m not saying you have to do anything in cash, but I just wanted to mention it because I don&#39;t think a lot of people realize this. SO all in all, I definitely recommend this place for some awesome bbq.

The heater was a bit cumbersome and got a little hot, but it was nice that they had them nonetheless. *interrupts review to climb over you and fill your water glass again*Our server was pleasant, but a bit too anxious. We needed more time to look at the menu and had to ask him for more time twice. He seemed a little annoyed that we only ordered non-alcoholic drinks. *interrupts review to climb over you and refill that DAMN GLASS AGAIN BECAUSE IT WENT DOWN 2 CENTIMETERS*He was the kind of server that was practically on top of you and all over you, until the second you need him and then he&#39;s nowhere to be found. Our (nonalcoholic) drinks took half past forever to come and arrived after our appetizers. The aforementioned server visited two times before they came out.

chicago-q-chicago,Phil D.,KnRAilT8d_88vUODqcZtVw,tZByCv_nIamQMeuR2QX2Mw,"Interesting concept, bringing bbq into a more fine dining setting. I can certainly understand the appeal, given that you&#39;re coming in for the entire dining experience(cue ambience, service, etc.), but this review is based on the merits of the bbq alone, and judged accordingly to other comparable bbq. I tried out the bbq slider trio with a side of cole slaw, and also got some of their home-made chips and pickles on the side. First off, not a major fan of pickles in general, so i&#39;ll offer no comment on that, but the chips were great. Warm, crispy, and with bbq seasoning that makes me wish they sold these in bags that I could just grab every time I walked by the place. Good start. Then the slider trio came out. Honestly a little smaller than I expected, but I suppose that&#39;s what I get for not committing to a single meat. As far as the meats go though, The brisket was in my opinion the star of the show, though the pulled chicken relatively was also quite good. The pulled pork I thought was just ok, though all of their meats were serviceable in their own route(flavored well with dry rub and not dry). The bbq sauces that came with however were all great, particularly the regular mild and spicy sauces. Actually, I would say that while Chicago Q had only decent meat, it&#39;s sauces really excelled and on their own would be a 5/5. What brings Chicago Q down is the price, as bbq entrees can easily run 1.5-2x as much than you would expect from other bbq establishments. On the merits of the food alone it&#39;s good but not mindblowing(though Chicago Q still solid 4/5 flavor q), and when a single platter and side plate runs you ~$20 or so(as opposed to the half as much at southern bbq joints), you sorta wish you got a bit more bang for your buck. In all, Chicago Q is an upscale bbq joint that benefits greatly from its ambience and setting, and would be a great place to bring a date or a grab a pleasant brunch or dinner with friends. However if you&#39;re coming down for some good-value Q to grab and go, or planning on finding a regular bbq joint, Chicago Q can be on the pricier side.",262,3,2,5,34,7.667999999999999,3.2220000000000004,0.328,13.45,No

The brisket filled quesadilla is also incredible. Get cornbread as a side and you won&#39;t be disappointed. Every meal starts with their signature bowls of complimentary chips and pickles.

chicago-q-chicago,Jason G.,s19c8t_yAmFrby90LjDk8g,p3mcxrkCUoCz4GnFR9mGxw,"I ate at Chicago Q with a friend on his recommendation, and while I really did want to like this place and it&#39;s a very nice space, the BBQ was just not as good as they were selling it.I hadn&#39;t heard of this place before I went here, but I guess that&#39;s OK because I&#39;m from out of town. Space itself is very nice, and large. There&#39;s an outdoor area and then a bar area with high tops, then a main dining room then an adjacent dining room with skylights, and then an entire upstairs. Everything seems brand-new and it&#39;s very modern.We basically tried everything from the entire restaurant. Six different types of meat. And to be perfectly honest, the macaroni and cheese was the best thing on the menu.They had this &#39;side menu&#39; of all the Kansas City and St. Louis BBQ joints that the chefs went to, and so I was excited because obviously the people that work here are really passionate about the product. But the results just didn&#39;t stack up to Kansas City BBQ at all. (My partner is from Kansas City, so I have very high standards and when it comes to BBQ.) The waiter highly recommended the brisket, but it was not fork-tender. We got two types of the ribs, but I honestly couldn&#39;t tell the difference. They were pretty good, but the bone didn&#39;t just fall off like really good ribs should do. The pulled pork was fine enough, but it was served dry. You really need to slather on the BBQ sauce to have a good bite. I think I was most disappointed with the burnt ends - they really should&#39;ve been in the smoker about three more hours, because they were not tender.They have a pretty substantial cocktail menu, which I initially appreciated. But then I realized once I got our food that the drinks were made by a bartender and the food was prepared by a chef, and they&#39;ve never talked. Both of our drinks clashed with the heavy spice rubs on the meat we ordered, so it&#39;s kind of a question why they&#39;re serving these particular drinks that are more sweet than savory. They do have a big bourbon selection, but they really need to work on that melding of food and drink more.Overall, this was a nice meal out, but they really pride themselves on having some of the best BBQ and get inspiration from Kansas City, and it just wasn&#39;t quite at that level.",233,3,2,5,39,8.1034,3.76,0.187,18.053,No

chicago-q-chicago,Steve A.,uEQ3nCdOBNOeJ0ow4Ds1vA,EJfV7EiRd445LsxZIGRSSA,"This might not be the best barbecue place in Chicago, but it&#39;s certainly the nicest, and I love their approach to food and beverage. They focus on flights of both, and offer variety in surprising ways. For example, we started with the barbecue flight, a good way to sample brisket, pulled pork and pulled chicken. It came with four(!) different barbecue sauces, all of which were good.Well, we didn&#39;t actually start with that, because when you sit down they give you a generous basket of seasoned house-made potato chips and delicious sweet pickles.For our main courses we had the chicken and waffles and another flight, this time of eggs benedict. I still don&#39;t really get the combination of chicken and waffles, but both were good--even better when I asked for some barbecue sauce to dunk the chicken in. The eggs benedict was served three ways, each of them huge: with brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken. But it was different from the barbecue flight, because each was on a different base: biscuit, fried green tomato, and corn bread. Each also had a different Hollandaise sauce, which my dining companion wisely opted to have on the side. A little bit was all it needed.There&#39;s a really extensive list of beers, wines, whiskey, bourbon, scotch and a limited list of cocktails. Staying with the flight theme, we tried the Grand Tasting, which consisted of nine(!) whiskeys. It wasn&#39;t cheap, but it was a real learning experience, because they were all so different, and the beverage manager was really knowledgeable about them.For the record, here are my ratings (on a scale of 10) for the flight:Auchentoshan Whiskey (American Oak) 6/10Hibiki Harmony (Japanese) 7/10Wieser Uuahouua (Pinot Noir barrels, Austrian) 7.5/10Compass Box Spice Tree (clove cardamom cinnamon) 7/10Elijah Craig (barrel strength 102 proof) 8/10Slaughter House by Orin Swift 9/10Noah&#39;s Mill Bourbon 6.5/10Willet Pot Still Bourbon 7/10Woodford Reserve Double Oaked 9/10I really like the whole approach to food and beverages at Chicago q.",262,5,2,5,43,5.449199999999999,2.067,0.183,14.751000000000001,No
chicago-q-chicago,Sara M.,6bFkl9kzAzKhL7Dkw5QOjg,7duyGoEETeP_l75DdT7kbg,"Oh man, was that a great brunch. Came here yesterday with a reservation and seated right away. There were 5 of us and we decided we would share everything. These portions are huge, I couldn&#39;t imagine not shearing with someone. Chicken and waffles, amazing, comes with syrup and a red pepper strawberry coulis. The chicken was tender and flavorful and the waffles were sweet and fluffy. Eggs Benedict flight, comes with three, a smoked chicken eggs Benedict, which has a kick, a prime brisket eggs Benedict and a southern eggs Benedict served on a fried green tomato. Sweet potato pancakes, delicious, and served with a dollop of pecan button on top and bacon, which was sweet and reminded me of marshmallows. Last but not least we ordered the pit masters Mac n cheese with brisket, bacon, and meatballs. So savory and heavy as you would expect but delicious. For 4 of us, we ordered 4 dishes and that was plenty of food, we had left overs on every plate. Service was great, the waiter was very friendly and gave great advice on what to choose. Would definitely go back, maybe for dinner next time to focus more on the bbq menu.",144,5,2,5,31,5.210300000000001,2.655,0.0,10.345,No
chicago-q-chicago,Andrea B.,fAbKgdbKkn4Px8kG54OVDQ,Hek1v9OBsJt1_5W1-yVR-Q,"Overall experience-3.75 stars!!! Came here on Saturday with a group of 8 friends. I happened to pick out this dinner choice, My vegetarian friend recommended Chicago q and if a vegetarian really liked a bbq restaurant I assumed 8 meat lovers would enjoy it. Everyone enjoyed it! When we got there the restaurant was pretty packed. All the outside tables were taken and it looked as though everything inside was filled as well ( it was 9pm on a Saturday and super busy) we probably got seated around 9:30PM (the restaurant was really packed and we had an increase of people to our dinner party). When we got seated they gave us complimentary pickles and chips. Holy wow! So good! we literally had the chips refilled a good 3-4 times! Now onto the food. I ordered the steak wedge salad (sans bacon and cheese). I&#39;m really not a fan of bbq food but, my salad was amazing. I ordered it with the balsamic vinaigrette and it was DELISH!  I also had a side of Mac and cheese (yum!) I it was a huge portion I had a good few days of left overs. But enough about my salad since I&#39;m sure most people don&#39;t go there ordering salads. My roommate ordered a half slab of baby back ribs ( really good, I ate a few). I really liked that they brought out 4 bbq sauces for the middle of the table so you can add your own flavoring. My other friend ordered an array of food. Pulled pork sandwiches, competition ribs, corn bread, coleslaw,the trio of sliders and they all loved it. We finished I the dinner with a massive slice of ice cream cake for the middle of the table. 5/8 of us nibbled on the dessert and there was still a few bites left over.Now that I got your attention with the delicious food I have to say the service was really meh. We had to hound the waitress for drink orders, refills, etc. She was definitely overwhelmed. Do I think there are other better bbq joints, sure but I think this was a pretty good nice sit down bbq restaurant.",239,3,3,5,76,11.042499999999999,6.972000000000001,0.174,19.853,No
chicago-q-chicago,Lauren K.,5hbs6TwGyT2YQKeN3xef_A,i8qv4acHUaBRb5db4Kp0Hg,"It&#39;s so q-q-q-q-cute!!!  Being the architectural junkie that I am I adored the fact that this newfound favorite BBQ restaurant is a renovated mansion that once existed in the midst of the Gold Coast neighborhood.  The exterior of the restaurant is beyond charming, and the white brick with the rounded front gives the impression that it is still in fact a home nestled amongst the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood.  It looks welcoming, and it surely is.  Plus the charm does not stop at the front door, rather there&#39;s a little bit of delightfulness and sweetness sprinkled throughout the interior of Chicago q.  The crown moldings and staircases that existed within the house have been maintained and it really adds to the delightfulness of the experience.  I am a huge fan of the rustic interior - not only was it fitting for the type of food being served, but it also gave me something to appreciate while waiting to eat.  The interior of the restaurant did make it feel like you were being served some good old home-cooked BBQ!Although we didn&#39;t have to pass much of our time seeing as how we received fantastic service, I was able to sway in my seat while singing along to so many of the classic rock songs.  Not only does Chicago q have good taste with regard to aesthetic appeal, but their taste in music was also right up my alley - I don&#39;t think they played a song that I didn&#39;t like.  Like I said, though, I didn&#39;t have that much time to just sit and enjoy the music since our server was so on top of everything.  Seeing as how we arrived between rush hour times, it was not busy in the restaurant, but our server appeared to be one of those people who&#39;d be attentive at any time.  Although soft-spoken he was able to make suggestions and checked in with us regularly about the quality of the food.Speaking of quality - it was PHENOMENAL.  It was easily some of the best BBQ I&#39;ve ever had!  I&#39;ll get back to the barbecue, but I want to talk about everything we ate in a linear fashion.  We were served these complimentary chips and butter pickles, and wow.  Just, wow.  I&#39;ve never had buttered pickles and now I don&#39;t think I ever want any other type of pickle.  Give me a jar of these pickles and I&#39;ll be totally satisfied.  And then we started off with the alligator appetizer.  I&#39;ve always been curious about alligator, and I&#39;ve heard that it sort of tastes like chicken and that&#39;s partly true but it&#39;s saltier.  Much saltier...and I loved it!  Kinda like the cheer goes: &#34;alligator, alligator...eat &#39;em up, eat &#39;em up&#34;...yes, in fact I think I will eat them up.  This alligator appetizer comes with corn and its frickin&#39; amazing.  That is not an understatement my friends.  Then my fianc’© and I decided to split the q3 which we ordered with pulled pork, brisket and a half slab of St. Louis ribs.  Everything was cooked to perfection, and you can tell they cook it slow and low just like it should be.  Although the sauces came with the entr’©e I liked all of the meats without sauce - they were that well-seasoned and juicy - but the sauce of course added a little welcome flair.  The ribs were the star of the meal, though I totally loved both the brisket and pulled pork...it&#39;s just that the ribs fell off the bone with just a light touch.  Usually that means they&#39;re fatty, and although these ribs were slightly fatty I believe that they just fell of the bone because they were cooked so damn well.  Again, the sauces come with so you can pour them on at your own leisure.  That&#39;s awesome because it gives you a chance to try all the sauces, though personally my favorite was the original one.  We also got the cornbread - although it was a tiny bit dry, I still loved the sweet flavor of it!Weirdly enough, I didn&#39;t get any beer with my meal (though that&#39;s a good thing because I barely had enough room to eat what I did), but if I had wanted beer I wouldn&#39;t have been able to get draft beers.  They only serve beers in bottles and it&#39;s at bit of an exaggerated price; they do however, have a plethora of Scotch and whiskey options which is always a huge bonus.  Like I said, the alcohol prices are a little up there, but then again it always is in Chicago.  The food is also somewhat costly, but I wouldn&#39;t say that it is over-priced for the quality and quantity of food you&#39;re getting.  Now I wish I&#39;d had room for dessert because they sounded great, but perhaps that just an excuse to come back and indulge a little more!  Truly, though, this is one of my favorite BBQ restaurants in and around the city and I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to come back here and get my hands dirty once more...though you didn&#39;t even really have to get your hands dirty because of how tender the meat was.  I didn&#39;t have to fight the ribs, and I can&#39;t fight this feeling any longer - I&#39;ve got to let my feelings flow: I love Chicago q!",519,5,3,5,76,16.7214,8.010000000000002,0.659,31.330000000000002,No

You would miss it if you were expecting it to look like a BBQ joint.   The inside had white table clothes and was clean. Coming from the south, it was different from what I&#39;m used to for a BBQ place. It wasn&#39;t crowded at this time. Our wait was 5 minutesFood: 3/5 - their menu had the typical BBQ items with choice of their competitive ribs or traditional. We shared the following apps: smoked wings, smoked bacon, and fried alligator. All were very good but heavy. My main course was a combination of brisket and traditional St. Louis ribs with a side of Mac and cheese. After eating the apps, I was only able to eat half of it.

A server brings seasoned chips and pickles once you&#39;re seated. This was a unique combination for complimentary starters. The chips and pickles were tasty. I almost filled up on both items before my meal arrived. I started with bacon cheddar hush puppies, which were delicious! I ordered spare ribs with cornbread and a side of mac n cheese as an entree. Ribs come with four different bbq sauces. The spare ribs and cornbread was tasty. Chicago q mac n cheese was average at best. It lacked flavor in my opinion. The price point for Chicago q mac n cheese was too high given its mediocre taste (IMO). Service was very attentive (excellent). It&#39;s patio seating available if you want to dine outside.

The service is extremely attentive (like that of a high end restaurant), the food is comforting, and the design is like that of Paula Deen&#39;s house. Immediately upon being seated, we were given a basket of housemade chips and bread and butter pickles. I am not a bread and butter pickle fan, but the chips were great - salty and flavorful. It was a nice treat to start the meal. Between the three of us, we ordered the chicken sandwich with fries, the pulled pork sandwich with honey cornbread, the brisket quesadilla, and the baked beans. The beans were okay - not great. We should have opted for the mad and cheese instead. The cornbread was amazing. Seriously. It&#39;s super sweet and moist. I honestly could not think of a way to improve it. The fries were not good. I actually enjoyed the chips more. The fries were really hard. The brisket quesadilla was pretty good. This was by far the smokiest of the meats. The bottom of the quesadilla was a bit soggy, but that&#39;s understandable when you are serving juicier meats. The pulled pork was pretty good. You really can never turn down a pretzel bun. The chicken sandwich was the winner. Though a bit fatty, the chicken was extremely moist and plentiful. The bun was the star of the show, though. The super soft, slightly sweet brioche stole my heart.Overall, this is a good restaurant for just about anything. I would gladly come here on a date or with a family.

chicago-q-chicago,Kimmie H.,b68BWU4xvICTu6_4O02Vwg,Al8ENdaaLQX-8VOo9uIpFQ,"This is Kimmie&#39;s husband writing this review. We went to brunch here on Sunday and had the WORST dining experience we had in Chicago. It was bad enough that Kimmie got harassed by a bee for 20ish minutes in the patio, we figured it&#39;s a risk you assume for eating outside in summer. Needless to say, this got our experience started on the wrong foot. However, a waiter/busboy was apparently so deathly afraid of bees, that when the offending bee left Kimmie alone, it landed on his hand causing him to react with such BLIND PANIC that he threw the plate he was holding out of his hand in order to fling the bee away. This action caused the plate to rocket out of his hand and fly past Kimmie&#39;s head, missing her left eye by inches. Dude threw the plate so hard that when it struck the wall, again mere inches from her head, it shattered into little ceramic shards. We were both stunned. The busboy/waiter then mumbled an apology and proceeded to wipe up the shards with a wet rag. Now why is this detail important? Because dude then came over and took our plates to box our leftovers WITHOUT washing his hands. I was disgusted, and when I inspected the leftovers at home, a GIANT HAIR was sitting right in the middle of one to-go box. Additionally, Kimmie&#39;s coffee contained debris floating on the surface that the waiter claimed to be coffee grounds, but which bore no resemblance to such grounds. No manager came over and apologized. Our main waiter did not apologize. Nothing! This worst and most unprofessional dining experience we have had in Chicago, and sadly we live nearby this place!I could rate this place zero start if Yelp would allow. Poor customer service and management!!!!Lastly, the food wasn&#39;t that good.

The first thing I gotta say is - this plate was huge! It fed me for two meals as I took the rest home for the next day&#39;s breakfast. The pork benedict was served on a fried green tomato with a sauce that was incredibly spicy and overpowering but it was still delicious. The highlight was the brisket benedict that came served on a biscuit and topped with a mustard sauce. Oh my! So, so good! The service during brunch was spectacular.

Let me tell you, this was one of the best meals I had in Chicago that weekend.The restaurant is definitely a more upscale bbq place; very nicely decorated and good for any occasion. They start you off with some homemade bbq potato chips and sweet butter pickles, and they were so addicting that I had to stop myself from ruining my appetite. The menu had quite a few options but I decided on ordering something off the brunch menu as initially intended. I got the smoked chicken eggs benedict and bf got the steak and eggs special. We also got an order of the blackened farm raised alligator to start. The alligator was DELICIOUS. It was juicy and light and citrusy with a hint of smokiness and garlic and garnished with some greens and a tomato/corn salsa. It was by far the best alligator I&#39;ve ever eaten, and I&#39;m from Florida. As for the entrees, the portions are HUGE.

Perfectly poached eggs with hollandaise over tender, flavorful smoked chicken, served on top of honey butter cornbread with home fries. Pulled chicken at some other places can sometimes be a little dry or bland, but not at Chicago q! The flavor combination was just WOW. Bf was also very satisfied with his steak and eggs and said it was meaty and tender with an awesome smokey flavor, and not too much fat. They don&#39;t have any steak sauce but they brought out a little tray of their special house bbq sauces and we didn&#39;t even really need them. The steak was nearly the size of his head though so he couldn&#39;t finish it, but gladly took the rest to-go.Although the prices are on the high end, the food and portion sizes are worth it.

The manager took our order and after a quick discussion on various Rye&#39;s we&#39;d each tried, he offered to put together a special flight for me. There were three premium Ryes. The photo shows what each was. My wife a daughter each had a Bulleit Bourbon Peach Teas. Man were they strong.They serve home-made pickles and home-made barbecue chips. When you finish a bowl they are quick to bring more.When our son arrived we moved to a table inside. More drinks - I had an Old Fashioned which was marvelous. My son ordered a Sazerac which I normally am not fond of, but this was quite good. Since it was our daughter&#39;s birthday she had a few more throughout the evening.Dinner was outstanding. I think I posted pictures of mostly everything. I had the smoked chicken with fries. My wife and daughter shared the &#39;pick three&#39; - brisket, St Louis Style ribs and pulled chicken. They also had a vegetable skewer. My son had one of their specials - Salmon with figs and a few other things. We also had their potato salad and an order of smoked chicken wings.I ended finishing up the Sazerac.

I would go here again. I got there three meat platter for dinner. I got the St Louis ribs which were fantastic and fall off the bone. I also got the brisket and pork sausage. The brisket was mediocre because there was very little moisture in it and also was reheated instead of fresh. When I flipped over the brisket piece it was seared on the bottom, which is a No-No in the barbecue world. On the other hand, the sausage was fantastic! I would definitely get the ribs and sausage again, but definitely not the brisket. I also got the savory cornbread. It was very dry and not much flavor. Definitely wouldn&#39;t get it again.

chicago-q-chicago,Eddie C.,rq9-MQ4REq9UzwsCgbMATw,Y7vwwHy4QrN3Qz3yGKhqsw,"My new go to BBQ restaurant, Chicago Q during restaurant week was epic.I spent 4 years in North Carolina and a bit of time in Texas, so I have had decent exposure to various BBQ styles. Chicago Q would hold its own to any restaurant in Carolina.Chicago Q was my second stop during restaurant week. After going to the Michelin Star rated Sepia the day before, I had really low expectations because Sepia served me an energy bar for dessert and an overcooked pork sponged thing for the main course. Chicago Q&#39;s interior reminded me of a southern mansion - something from Gone with the Wind. It was charming and felt appropriate for &#34;classy&#34; bbq.The waiter was friendly and got us started right away with sweet pickles and fresh chips. Wow, these were good. We ordered the restaurant week menu, which was another 3 course deal for 22 dollars. The first course was three chicken wings in a super complex and rich bbq sauce. The meat was tender enough that we were able to use a butter knife and fork to pull everything off. To be honest, my girlfriend and I were already starting to get full by the end of this course.The main course was crazy. I got the beef brisket, which included 4 Subway Footlong Sandwich length beef pieces sliced thinly. I also substituted a hearty portion of bruled mac and cheese for the normal fries. AND THE SAUCES! The courses were served with 4 different sauces from various BBQ styles, including the Carolinas, Memphis, and Texas. BBQ fusion? I literally ate like 6 bites and just didn&#39;t have any more room in my stomach. IT was so tasty though that I pushed through and finished half of the meal. My poor GF got the baby back rips and went through like 2 out of the 6 ribs. We sat there in stupor while the server boxed up the food for us. Then, he brought out dessert and I just laughed. I ordered cookies thinking I would get some bite sized baked goods. Nope. The cookies were massive Texas sized. I laughed and immediately asked to get it boxed up.I went home and fell asleep shortly after. It was marvelous. 100% will come back",254,5,1,5,-35,4.517100000000001,3.616,0.838,26.546999999999997,No

chicago-q-chicago,Michelangelo V.,uPifAul4hJIqy72ah1GKSA,NNdfumTXCKJzY-cFPuJ2_A,"Honest review: saw it on check please. i was really skeptical but it was great. I always thought hog wild was the best but this beats it. Free barbecue chips: from my experience of chips there either really old and stale to thin and burned or really bland and greasy. But these were heavenly really crunchy really fresh perfect seasoning not to much of a barbecuey taste( i mean like sometimes the barbecue flavor could be really over whelming) and not greasy! Best chips i ever had sorry lays make sure u eat with the pickles for the perfect bite.Free pickles: i usually dont like pickles because their never fresh or have way to much pickling spice on it so its to sour or to overpowered these were perfect. A lil bit of vinegar and some good sweetness really was delicious i was so surprised. Its not like really sweet like dessert just the right amountBlackened alligator: dont be scared of tasting new things if u like chicken then youll love this but with more of a chicken flavor. It comes with a pancake on the bottom didnt see a point to it lol would have preffered something else maybe grittz. The sauce is really good its a roasted garlic aioli and its not mayonnaise from a jar like a lot of people do this was homemade it was delicous really enhanced the taste of the alligator. It comes with lemon which cuts down the richness of the dish. The alligator itself had a really good flavor to it not to over powered by the blacking spice and not to dry it was really tender a really great dish live a little and try something different Hush puppies: these were really good supper crispy not burned or greasy seasoned perfectly. The inside was a little dry though. It had bacon wish it had a little more though. Didnt notice any cheddar in it?The sauce was to die for it was so good best aioli i ever had so rich u will not want to stop eating these their that good.Corn dog pork belly: i love pork belly so this was a no brainer it was so good if u loved fried food this is for u. Its so crispy not like how street vendor corndogs are i mean like really crispy. The pork belly was cooked nicely the fat was cooked off so it wasnt like all gelatinous( like for example when chicken skin is flabby thats what i mean) really seasoned good. The mustard sauce was so good it really enhances the flavor of the pork. The coleslaw on the side is very vinegary so it cuts through the richness of the dish and makes it taste better the only problem is if u eat the coleslaw by it self it has an off putting pickling spice i couldnt figure out what it was but there was a certain spice that made it a lil funkyBbq flight: kobe brisket i made a vow after my last trip to county barbecue never to eat brisket again because its always bland and dry this was not the case!:) it was a lil dry not like omg i need a laser to cut it but like a lil bit. It was really flavorful really a high quality meet it was really good i wish they added the house seasoning on top of it for extra flavor and an added crunch but it was really good. There was no fat or sinu anywhere thank god!!! Really good flavor to it maybe just smoke it for longer for more of a smokey flavorPulled pork. I love pulled pork but i dont judge good barbecue based on that because it is really hard to fuck up but there have been times where people fucked up. It was really good. The pork was actually pulled not just shredded witch does make a difference in texture. There were parts that were really smokey( means looks black or burned thats just smoke) it had a really good flavor not to dry and no fat or sinu thats the worst in pulled pork when it has a bunch of fat or sinu that makes it so gross again wish they added the house seasoning on top of it for crunch and flavorThe chicken: i didnt really eat a lot of it cause i ordered alot and wanted to taste everything it wasnt dry it had a good smokey flavor to it alot of times chicken is really dry and bland this was notBarbecue sauces: mustard i love mustard i think good barbecue needs mustard homemade though not some crap from the store. Wow was it good a lil sweet and tangy but really was one of the best mustards i ever had.spicy barbecue sauce: i think its just the normal barbecue sauce with chili flakes. I liked the original plain one its sweet witch is really good not to sweet just i like spicy food. This sauce really does enhance the flavor of the meat i put it on everything even took it home in a to go container.Vinegar sauce: this wasnt really vinegary like i wanted it just a lil bit and a lil bit sweet for me this tasted the best on the ribs Completion st luis ribs: omg the ribs are so good. There tender but not fall off the bone tender theres a good meaty chew which is the correct way to cook ribs. It had a saice on top so its either been glazed while it was smoking or on the top it was really good agains sweet but not to sweet. There cut for u! Thank u jesus!

It looks super fancy, but you don&#39;t have to be in your Sunday best to eat in. (I had been at work all day, then on a plane, then on the subway, THEN caught in the rain and still managed not to look out of place.) It is, however, a nicer restaurant and if I hadn&#39;t been so desperate for food, I would have definitely changed out of my grungy clothes.You&#39;re given two starters before your meal: thick, homemade potato chips and sweetened pickles. I cannot express how delicious both of these items were, which made me super excited for my meal! I mean, if the free stuff is that tasty, how could the entree not be amazing?! Also, as a side note, I hate pickles. I mean a boiling, fiery hatred. But these pickles had some sort of sweetened sauce/seasoning that made me forget I was enjoying eating my food nemesis.Anyway, my partner and I both ordered the pulled pork sandwich, he got a side of cornbread and I stuck with the classic french fries. My partner, also a BBQ fan and pulled pork aficionado, and I loved every bite of our pulled pork sandwiches. One of the more unique details about Chicago q is your ability to create your own sauce out of the four styles brought to your table, separate from your plate. There&#39;s a traditional/sweet, spicy, mustard, and vinegar BBQ sauce all brought out with your meal, and you can dabble in each to create a blend of delicious sauce. I mixed mainly the traditional, with a touch of spicy and mustard.The cornbread was okay -- a bit too crumbly for my partner&#39;s (or my) liking. To be honest, the fries weren&#39;t much of a standout either as I can&#39;t really remember them. But those pickles man -- MMM!",214,5,3,5,58,4.2918,2.427,1.8559999999999999,14.716,No

Upon arriving right on time for our 7:30 reservation, we checked in with the hostess and were told that a table wouldn&#39;t be ready for another 25 minutes, despite the fact that we had a reservation. They cited an unexpected, very large party as the reason they were running behind, but after making this reservation about 2 weeks in advance it was extremely frustrating. I certainly understand that things like that can happen, but I would have appreciated an advanced warning or some sort of consolation for the fact that they were not honoring our reservation. I hate to sound like a snob, but we try to make reservations as much as possible because we both hate long waits, and it was very irritating that nobody on the staff seemed to respect that. Needless to say, our experience didn&#39;t get off on the best foot.After about 30 minutes, we were finally seated. From that point on the service was good, and we both found the food to be above average but not great. My girlfriend has the smoked chicken, and I had a 3 meat sampler platter with pulled pork, sliced brisket, and baby back ribs.

You would think it&#39;d be crazy busy but there were empty tables all over the place! You can make a reservation for brunch, which is quite rare in the city, if that makes you feel more comfortable. The building itself is really cool and quite different from most Chicago restaurants, very spacious. Our server was very nice, checked in on us several times throughout our meal and the busboys were on point with water refills and clearing dishes.I ordered the benedict flight which was really good! Great way to try all 3 benedicts and get some brisket, pork and chicken. I liked the chicken and pork ones the best. I also tried my friends carrot cake pancakes which were quite good as well. The glaze they put on them in particular is delicious. They also bring you chips and pickles right when you get seated which is a nice touch!The only thing holding me back from a full 5 star rating is price. Compared to a lot of brunch places it&#39;s pretty expensive, which is somewhat understandable given the dishes that come with pork, brisket, etc...

As an East coaster, and a born and raised southerner, I tend to be a little snotty about my BBQ.  I&#39;m currently living in Boston, a land void of real and delicious BBQ.  Chicago q, was excellent though.  Although I had the pulled pork eggs benedict with the fried green tomatoes (which was excellent and a must try!), I also had the opportunity to taste ribs, award winning pulled pork (this is AMAZING, PLEASE HAVE PULLED PORK WHEN YOU DINE HERE), and chicken.  The chicken, was chicken, so I wouldn&#39;t say go for it....but we were even told that by our excellent and attentive server.  The benedict was unique with a creole style hollandaise and fried green tomatoes instead of the typical carbohydrate that is served with a good old fashioned benny.  It was divine, I am salivating just thinking about it.  Upon return, I would opt for some straight pulled pork.Meals start with bread and butter pickles, house-made, which I&#39;m not really a fan of, but these were to DIE for....also, served are house made potato chips, which I didn&#39;t have a chance to try because my family scarfed them down so quickly.

Look for the white house on the block with a smallish lowercase q on the wall.They had an impressive selection of local beers to choose from. We all picked our favs along with an appetizer of mac and cheese and fried green tomatoes. The mac and cheese was fabulous and well done. The tomatoes didn&#39;t do it for me but then again they are not among my favorites.I went with the brisket as did others in the group. As a side I picked cornbread while others went with fries. My brisket was good but nothing to write home about. They provided four sauces on the table to augment it. I found the spicy sauce to pair the best. The cornbread was a huge chunk and very good. Our server was awesome and cracked jokes with us all night long.

But the experience dining here overall was just A-OK.The cocktails sound better than they actually are.  I ordered a Jalapeno Margarita, a teeny bit spicy and strong, but it wasn&#39;t great.  I struck out when I ordered a bourbon cocktail, served in a cute little glass pitcher, but it wasn&#39;t great and despite the cuteness, not worth the price.  Cocktails were all $12-15.  Beer is beer, but none of my friends were too enthusiastic about the cocktails.  So if you&#39;re dining at Chicago Q, dive right into your meal and skip the cocktail menu.Our group ordered some appetizers, and I selfishly ate more than my fair share of hush puppies.  Those were good!  But I&#39;ve never had a bad hush puppy.The macaroni &amp; cheese option is a fun game of mix &amp; match.  You can order the mac regular (just cheese), 2 meats, or 3 meats.  I only wanted one, but since that wasn&#39;t an option, I went with 2 and chose the brisket meatballs and pulled pork.  This cheesy dish will more than satisfy any mac &amp; cheese addict.  The brisket meatballs were tender and delicious.  Honestly it&#39;s one of the best mac &amp; cheese dishes in Chicago.  $16 might be outrageous, but it was worth it considering I made two meals out of this.I was disappointed with the corn bread.  It was dry and for $7 you get a chunk of bread with a tiny bit of butter.  Meh, skip it!Overall, my stomach was happy, but my wallet was not.  There is no shortage of BBQ in the city, and although the inside of Chicago Q is more posh lodge than bar-bee-cue hoe down, it wouldn&#39;t be at the top of my BBQ list.Service was terrible.  At a table of 7, they screwed up 2 orders.  One of my friends got the wrong entree and another friend&#39;s meat was very undercooked.  They did comp the meals and fix the error, but doing so was time consuming.Don&#39;t be a fool - the mac &amp; cheese is awesome, but like many restaurants in this area, it&#39;s going to be hit or miss.",240,3,1,3,-1,2.3162000000000003,4.140000000000001,3.3470000000000004,19.513999999999996,No

After seeing the reviews and photos, I thought for sure that we would have a great experience. Not so very much.I came here with a group of lady friends on a weeknight. We had a reservation (thank goodness because this place got packed!). While I was waiting for for everyone to show up, I ordered a beer at the bar. The bartenders were not friendly at all, and I noticed that the drinks were quite pricey. Later on, many people didn&#39;t like the drinks that they ordered. I was told that the Old Fashioned was good. The beer list was decent as well.Eventually we were seated and given pickles and BBQ chips made in-house. Those were delicious. Then service just went drastically downhill. Our waitress was nice, but we had to flag her down SO many times. To order drinks, appetizers, food, get the check, tell her about issues we had with the food, etc. The food and drinks took forever to come to the table. When we finally got the food, one girl&#39;s steak was completely overdone, and another girl ended up receiving something she didn&#39;t even order. She had to wait so long to get her food. By the time she got hers we were done. Then she had to wait for her side!! The manager did take their food completely off the bill, but that&#39;s really terrible. Beyond that, I thought the food was mediocre. Nothing comes pre-sauced. They bring you 4 sauces (we were never told what they were...so we guessed). I got the slider trio. There was barely any meat on the buns. The brisket was good, but the pulled pork and chicken were just ok. The people who got the mac and cheese were happy. Everyone else said it was just ok. The corn bread was a little dry - they give you 3 huge pieces and one little tiny dollop of butter(you have your choice between 2 kinds). The hush puppies were the best part of the meal.When it was all said and done, the food was really overpriced for the quality and service.

Plus, they didn&#39;t seem to mind photo taking. In any case, I enjoyed my super strong Tally Me Banana. I couldn&#39;t taste much pineapple or banana, but it did the trick to get the buzz going. It wasn&#39;t served in a fun glass which was a bummer. We also ordered the luau chips for the table and that was a nice snack. I did like that it wasn&#39;t overly loud so we could hear ourselves chat. I&#39;m torn between a 3 and a 4.

Knowing it was super early, I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d encounter any issues.We only ended up with 7 in our party, but I&#39;m not sure how 8 would have even squeezed in the booth they gave us. Even though we had reservations two months prior, we were jammed into a booth. We did even come close to fitting, so they ended up placing two chairs awkwardly on the outside of the booth. We were told this is how they always do it, but I find that hard to believe given how awkward it felt (and I don&#39;t understand why it wasn&#39;t already set up like that). We also weren&#39;t given enough menus, so we had to share. Given the size of the drink selections, we would have loved to all have a menu to peruse!

I won&#39;t say those of you that don&#39;t like &#34;3 Dots&#34; don&#39;t &#34;get&#34; it because I HATE when I hear that. (Mostly from my wifey poo.) For instance after lame romantic comedy she&#39;ll say to me  &#34;You just didn&#39;t get it&#34;. And I&#39;ll reply back &#34;Nope just didn&#39;t like it.&#34; For instance I enjoy ALIENS 4, Akira, Spirited Away, Japan over France for vacation, and truly believe The Moody Blues &#34;A Question of Balance&#34; is the greatest single recording from in history . Good luck convincing anybody else. I&#39;ve tried and failed . We humans like what we like. I&#39;m freakie for tiki. You just don&#39;t like it. That&#39;s it! But I believe many of you may grow to dig &#34;3 Dots and a Dash.&#34; Someday. One day you may (sorry) &#34;get&#34; it. I used to be teased about  my love of the musical Hamilton, Shatner, West World, The Prisoner (TV show), Iron Man, Biale Black Chicken wine,and Star Trek. Now they are all retro hip and cool. I was ahead of the curve. However, sometimes I&#39;m not ahead of the curve. Lost in Space (1965),Johnny Quest, Land of the Lost, Thundaar, Voltron, The Kinks (Arista years), Ultraman , Riverview Amusement Park collectibles, Johnny Socko, &amp; Wizzo the Magician, I&#39;m still almost alone on in my appreciation of.&#34;3 Dots &amp; a Das&#34; could turn out to be either for you . Epic or just Blah. Both crowds correct.To me? EPIC! Big time!I&#39;m fascinated by tiki culture. It&#39;s my private obsession. I&#39;ve always DREAMED of being in a Tiki Bar when it was happening, hip, and THE place to be. Don the Beachcomber, The Luau, Trader Vic&#39;s, Kahiki, or Kona Kai, in their heyday in the 1960&#39;s. Wow, to have been there once upon a puff when Tiki was THE scene. To me it&#39;d be like being at the original Playboy Club in Chicago, The Pump Room w/ Irv Kupcinet and Sinatra drinking 2 fingers of Jack, or seeing The Doors on stage at The Whiskey a Go Go, back in the day. My experiences of seeking tiki in every city during a lifetime have always lead me to the old, the faded, and the dingy. Their heyday but a mustard burp lost to the vapor. Their glory years in the rearview mirror.So my visit to &#34;3 Dots and a Dash&#34; made me burst w/ joy and almost cry. Sincerely.It&#39;s but a dream. An oasis in a basement. Beautiful women in Polynesian attire bring bizarre expertly crafted concoctions loaded w/ the freshest fruit and ingredients YOU CAN TASTE. (Their intricate drinks aren&#39;t from some stale powered mix or a can.) Exotica fills you from first sip.Notice the thought that went into the menu . Kitsch overload! Just holding that menu was worth the visit. Did I just time travel? Nobody does menus like this anymore. Slapdash and rehash is the norm now. Not here. Delight is in the details. Notice the different sculpted glasses for every drink!!! Each individual  one a work of art.It has an almost &#34;secret&#34; speakeasy entrance The Batman would tip his cowl to.The swizzle sticks are mermaids.Is that a full cinnamon stick and large chunk of coconut in this icy ceramic totem? Now my treasure is others trash. I get that! You may HATE this place. Some evidently do. I read your reviews. But I think they are  the born in Chicago types that sit at Blackhawks games and cheer on The Redwings. Jag offs. Some will see silly glasses, tacky menus, dank basement, and sexism on display in some of the art and required staff garb. Ugh. I feel sorry for those that recoil in falsehood. Oh , the deluded brainwashed masses.The offended by everything crowd. A cancer to our society really.  Sorry, I keep getting off topic because I&#39;m still buzzed out of my zombied skull right now.If I wanted to be like hipsters that breathe out loafs of loathing at all they survey I would complain that the music they play wasn&#39;t even a bit tiki. The music could be much better. They could throw a bit of exotica or space age bachelor pad music  in. Heck, even a minute of Walt Disney&#39;s Enchanted Tiki Bird music might be nice. Xylophone anyone?The food I tried was great but the drinks are the real stars. Drinks that could fuel a stealth bomber.BEWARE LADIES you might wake-up w/ someone that looks like me next to you if you aren&#39;t careful. Deceivingly POWERFUL in their almost unseen ability to sneak up on you their drinks are like an invisible maniac in his invisible Cadillac that run you over.

You want a tiki bar, well you&#39;ve got one - the best one - at this elusive underground watering hole, so to speak.  Three Dots and a Dash really is the modern day watering hole for all those people getting off work and desperately needing some alcoholic fun in their lives.  I happily include myself into this category as I am always down with getting a noteworthy buzz on.  The drinks are so strong that it&#39;s impossible not to feel a little somethin&#39; somethin&#39; after having just one of these fancy concoctions.  Unlike so many other bars, Three Dots and a Dash is not stingy with the amount of alcohol they are pouring up, though thus out to be the case since you&#39;re paying quite a lot for them.Yes, it&#39;s pricey here (on average a drink is about $14) but you&#39;re going to feel mighty fine halfway through your drink because of the fact that the drink probably consists of 75-85% alcohol.  I would have loved to more drinks, but there&#39;s always next time.  When I did go however, I ordered the Dead Reckoning and my fianc’© ordered the Jet Pilot.  Both drinks were amazing, but the Jet Pilot may have been my preference because of the cinnamon in it - thay was quite a twist and I loved it. Like I said, though, both were awesome and it was hard to choose when every other drink looked just as sinfully good.I&#39;m obsessed with the mugs/glasses the drinks came in, and had I been drunk enough I probably would have splurged and bought one.  Yes, you can buy the mugs that the drinks come in, but for about $30.  They&#39;re super awesome, though!  Speaking of awesome, can we just talk about the actual atmosphere itself?  The lighting is very dimmed which sets the mood for a relaxing get together with friends; there&#39;s a bunch of lounges amongst the regular tables and the tiki bar itself dazzles with brilliance as it displays all of it&#39;s rum.  It&#39;s fairly big inside, but from what I hear this doesn&#39;t suffice most of the time due to hw buy it gets.  When I went on a weeknight it wasn&#39;t overly crowded and we got a table right away.  Obviously, the weeknights allow for easier access than do the weekends, but isn&#39;t that the case anywhere?  Okay, so we have established that drinks are the bomb and the atmosphere is legit - well what about the food?  I didn&#39;t eat much, and there&#39;s really not much to choose from (because it&#39;s primarily a lounge, duhhh), but we got the Thai fried chicken.  This was spectacular and I would highly recommend that you get it if and when you make your way to Three Dot and a Dash.  P.s. to actually get into Three Dots and a Dash you have to find the alleyway.  Here are some clues for finding it: there&#39;s a blue light that illuminates the entry way, there&#39;s a big old bouncer standing outside and there are most likely people wandering around the same alleyway, aimlessly looking around.  You have to be 21 to get in, so if you&#39;re not then I guess you&#39;re S.O.L.  Once you&#39;re in, though, you are golden and you&#39;re about to get tipsy!  (&#34;Everybody in the club get tipsy!&#34;)Although all the drinks have multiple components to them, the bartender(s) are efficient in making them, but the serving staff does a good job of making sure all the patrons are getting what they need and in a timely fashion.  Overall, this is a great establishment and I&#39;m excited to come back for more drinks.  Aloha for now!",368,5,1,5,3,9.5142,4.343,0.546,26.111,No

There was a short line already but the line moved up pretty fast. You can tell that this place is pretty popular :) If you want to sit down and order some appetizers, make sure to reserve a table in advance. If you only want drinks, there&#39;s only standing room around the bar. We ordered the western sour and the poblano escobar. It tasted very tropical fruity and strong at the same time (YUM).

So when it came time to actually go, I was super excited as I had been stalking the place.I feel like it was an over priced experience. Honestly, won&#39;t be going back and not even on anybody elses dime. I had the painkiller, which is one of the more popular drinks. Yes it was strong and yummy! The appetizers left something to be desired. The chips served with the gauc were AWFUL. Although, the thai chicken was pretty decent, the crab rangoon which is super simple to make was under cooked. The food didn&#39;t even come to our table hot :( I left this place hungry, a little buzzed and underwhelmed. We were celebrating a birthday ( had the birthday balloons at the table to prove it!) and the server just gave off the energy/vibes that she did not want to be there or tried to ensure we had a pleasant experience. At one point someone in my party sent back a drink because it wasn&#39;t what was expected and she paused and had an attitude about it, although she did give them a chance to order another one.I don&#39;t have a problem with paying a couple more dollars for a cocktail due to it&#39;s real estate but, I do have a problem when it isn&#39;t worth it!

three-dots-and-a-dash-chicago,Ashley M.,YMYb73K3Dv3oiac4mADJSg,uWtTWYGQDlYU8iaa3iiNtA,"Awesome place! After reading an article naming Three Dots and a Dash one of the &#34;best Tiki bars in America&#34;, I knew I had to try this place on my next visit to Chicago! Because the food menu is light, the boyfriend and I decided to come here for pre-dinner drinks on date night. We made reservations online 4 days in advance and the only time slot open was at 5pm...on a Monday!  I do want to note that I&#39;m not sure how accurate their OpenTable reservation system is, or how many seats they keep open outside of their reservation system, because for taking the last availability on this day, they were completely empty when we arrived. The place filled up within the two hours we were there, but if you&#39;re curious to come here and you don&#39;t see an opening in their reservation system, don&#39;t be discouraged and try your luck anyway!Also, as noted by the other reviews, the entrance to this place is in an alley - east of Clark, between Hubbard and Illinois. There is a small brown sign hanging over the doorway so it was not too hard to find.Once inside, you walk down a few dark stairs and at the basement level, you&#39;re immediately transcended into a dark Tiki bar with a lounge atmosphere. The lighting is fun, the bartenders and servers are festive, and the overall ambiance is sexy, welcoming, and nice without being too obnoxious. This turned out to be the perfect place to begin our date!After a tour of the menu by our friendly server, we enjoyed the following:Painkiller No. 109 - Virgin Island &amp; Jamaican Rums, coconut, passion fruit, pineapple, creamThe Original Bunny&#39;s Banana Daiquiri - Jamaican spiced and overproof rums, coconut liqueur, banana, lime, nutmegThree Dots and a Dash - Aged Rhum Agricole, Guyanese rum, honey, falernum, lime, allspice, angostura bittersPoipu Beach Boogie Board - Rye whiskey, overproof rum, guava, maraschino, grenadine, pineapple, lemonCan I say they were all good?! The drinks are expertly crafted and arrive adorned with cool garnishes, like the banana dolphin on my daiquiri. Seriously, this place is bomb dot com and a must-try in the city!",258,5,2,5,44,4.7622,2.7800000000000002,0.559,11.661,No

Apparently, Three Dots and a Dash shares the same address with Bub City but Three Dots and a Dash&#39;s entrance is in the back alley between North Clark and North Dearborn...which is makes this place kind of hidden, but not quite so because almost everyone knows about it.I was not happy to see a line stretched down the alley/parking lot, especially in the cold but the 20-minute wait was not awful. I haven&#39;t been to enough bars in Chicago to know if bars usually get crowded to the point where you feel claustrophobic and have to squeeze in to order at the bar, but I can see why they like to keep a limited capacity. It was not overwhelming at the bar and it was pretty refreshing to not even have to try to flag down the bartender (who I think his name was Eddie) and have him come to you. I had the Bunny&#39;s Banana Daiquiri and I love that they used a real banana in the mix but oh man, this was too sweet for my liking; the best I can describe this is that it&#39;s like a spiked, watery smoothie. This was no light drink at all--the mix was heavy (not necessarily heavy on the alcohol) and will probably make you regret having dinner. My friend had the Dead Reckoning and it was a lot lighter. They seem to mainly use Jamaican Rum in their drinks, so a plus if that&#39;s your calling. 5 starts for presentation, too.This place was filled with a lot of nice people and because they limit a certain amount of people at a time, you will probably not have to push your way to get through and get elbowed. There was a dance floor...but it was dead, which was sad. Gimmicky but a must-visit for Chicago nightlife...unless you live in the Pacific Islands.",207,3,1,2,-34,1.4948,1.1380000000000001,1.093,11.769,No

The drinks are about $13 and they&#39;re strong as hell. 2 will keep you buzzed for the night -- in the best way possible.My friends and I ordered so many but my favorites were the mai tai and the painkillers. You&#39;ll see skulls next to a few drinks on the menu. Be careful - they are STRONG.The ambiance is great and if you go on a weeknight, the lines aren&#39;t too bad and you&#39;ll get a table pretty easily!

The entrance is in an alley, down a dark stairway, and then you find yourself in a fairly dim, tiki-themed space that fits the theme one hundred percent.I had two different cocktails, both quite different and each quite delectable. The first was a bourbon-based drink with grapefruit called a Western Sour. The second was the Surf Report with gin, cucumber, and mint. I would order each again. Of course, they have the big sharing bowls and next time I&#39;d be inclined to try one of those.They do have some food options if you need a bite to eat, but the drinks alone are worth the adventure in.",86,4,1,3,2,2.331,0.952,0.097,6.9510000000000005,No

Once you get in, it has a nice decor which goes with the ambiance.Being a newbie, I relied a lot on our waitress to pick a drink.  When she suggested the Mai Tai, I must have looked skeptical, but she assured me iit was amazing and most other places don&#39;t make it right. It was the best Mai Tai I&#39;ve had.  It wasn&#39;t too sweet at all but was fresh and light.  My sister had the Bunny Banana Daquiri which was a boozy smoothie (and came with a banana dolphin).  Both drinks definitely pack a punch.  Finally, we shared the Dead Reckoning on recommendation.  The rum, port, pineapple, vanilla and bitters played very well with each other.  All of the drinks were well-balanced and boozy but smooth.  The drinks aren&#39;t cheap at $13/cocktail but are fairly in line with the area.

We walked around in 0 degree weather with no coats looking for the entrance. After asking about 4 different people, we finally figured it out. But this is part of what makes the place so cool. Right when you walk inside, you walk downstairs to get to the restaurant.Right when we walked in (15 min late because it was so hard to find), they told us they were doing last call because they were closing down at 7 to prep for NYE. We were confused because the lady on the phone told us we could order drinks until 6:45 so we spoke to a manager who was very friendly and let us order two rounds while we were there. DRINKS: We asked the server for her recommendation (great server!) and ended up ordering the Zombie Punch. It was so delicious and such a cool concept! It came in a big skull head and there were four huge bendy straws so we all just shared and sipped it. Then ordered another one. Oops. Never had a drink like this before! FOOD: We ordered the Luau Chips with Pineapple/Avocado dip, Thai Fried Chicken and the Hanali Spring Rolls, which were both delicious!

Given how competitive other brunch places have become with bloody mary&#39;s (loaded with lots of interesting garnishes), I was a little bummed at the simplicity of this one. It was decent though.I ordered a Mac and Cheese. Apparently the Mac and Cheese was supposed to have beef cheek. It was pretty bad. I think I counted 4 pieces of meat, all different sizes. The pasta itself was overcooked, and the mac and cheese was really more of a pasta in a bland cheese sauce. Very disappointing.My fiance&#39;s chicken thigh sandwich, on the other hand, was quite good - he added an egg on it for $2, bringing the total entree price to $17 - a little steep for a burger, but it was decent so no real complaints there.

the-promontory-chicago,Michelangelo V.,uPifAul4hJIqy72ah1GKSA,4-hzVGM3uqptVX9-WccLRA,"Honest review: this is the sister restaurant of duseks and longman and eagle i love those two but i always have service issues there so i prefer going here instead n its more affordable to. Even though there was execution issues the food was amaizin like their sister restaurants i will be back. The service was amaizing everybody is supper friendly knowledgeable and attentive. The price is expensive but not as expensive as their sister restaurants. The restaurant is hard to find its right by the clothing store akira n it jus has a P on the restaurant. The best things were the kolbi short ribs, the pork shank/ the kentucky burgoo, the souffl’© n the apple fritters. I will be back to try the rest of the things on the menu!  Kolbi beef short ribs: best appetizer of the night so amaizing. Its a combination of sweet and salty. The sauce is to die for its hard to see it because it blends with cast iron pan so when your eating it rub it along the pan to get the sauce! Then theirs pickled peppers i wish there was more because the vinigar cuts through the richness of the dish and makes it pop. The nuts were really good because their like candied so not only do they add a crunch to the dish but their so tasty. The short ribs are seasoned perfectly not burned i wish they were more thicker because their small placesRamp risotto: good but not great. The texture of the risotto was perfect not to runny but still holds it own. Its not hard or mushy that it gets stuck in ur teeth its so decadent. It has asparagus which adds a nice summer flavor to it. Their are these croutons that are so delicious i couldnt stop eating them.idk whay kind of cheese was in it but it added a nice creamyness to the dish and i love cheese my only two complaints is that i didnt see any morels like morels are one of the best mushrooms so i think it should have been utilzed better grilled or fried or made with a really rich sauce. Another thing was even though being very succesful there was no wow factor to it no pop this dish needs to be elevated Kentucky burgoo: omg so decadent. Its like a cassoulet but different. The broth was really rich not to acidic like tomatoe dishes could be but a lil salty so hold back on the salt. The corn bread was amaizing best corn bread i ever had it wasnt dry and wasnt to sweet jus wish there was more to counter act the saltyness of the pork belly. I couldnt tell what was the veal breast or the pork belly but one of the proteins was a lil over cooked and a lil over charred but still delish. The sausage was aamaizing but i like my sausage burnt but they probably made it like for texture purposes. I liked the okra it was pickled so it was vinagery to cut through the richness even though there was flaws it can be fixed i would order this again so good Braised pork: the portion is really big so if ur hubgry order this. The pork was so tender! No utensils needed. The flavor was so flavorful wasnt bland at all wish skin crispier. The sauce was so rich i loved it its really rich i wish there was more of it because theres alot of pork. I loved the sweet potato puree the sweetness of the potato goes perfect with the saltiness of the pork love sweet and salty! Theres orange zest that cuts through the richness i loved it!! Would have preferred a sauce so the acidity is evenly distributed. I liked the johnny cakes a nice touch maybe something crunchy instead to give the dish crunch or naan bread to eat everything together. An awesome dish if ur hungry and want alot order this its so tasty would order it again Apple fritters: amaiaizn. It was perfectly fried not greasy and it was coated good sometimes theirs only sugar on certain places. It had alot of apple flavor which is good cause sometimes when they say their a specific kind of donut u dont taste it. The carmal sauce was so good i couldnt stop licking the plate wish there was a lil more. The crumble was a good added a savory note to cut through the sweetness wish it had more of a cheddar flavor. There were apples that were so tasty with raisins i couldnt stop eating them they made the fritters so tasty. Then theirs this powder stuff idk what it was it wasnt necessary i would just not bother adding it to the dish. The only flaw to this dish was the fritters were a lil uncooked in the middle. Like it was mushy n doughy i was a lil disappointed but this dish is still amaizin will order again Smore Souffl’©: (be warned extremely hot n takes 20 minutes to make) so this is the best souffl’© i ever had. The souffl’© texture was perfect soft but not falling apart or hard . It had a good chocolate flavor rich but not bitter. The marshmallow was a nice touch and its toasted  i love marshmallow it makes things so rich and decadent n theres alot of it. The ice cream was amaizin idk what flavor it was it was so flavorful i couldnt stop eating it i need a bucket of the ice cream to go. This is one of the best desserts i ever had id come back just for this",535,5,4,5,124,18.012700000000002,9.171999999999999,2.1100000000000003,34.719,No

I got the Sunset non-alcoholic cocktail, which was incredibly refreshing and tasty. After struggling immensely at trying to decide what to order, I finally ended up with the goats milk oatmeal and sides of toast and bacon. The bacon was fine - not crunchy enough for my tastes. The oatmeal was delicious! It has a perfect sweet, but also slightly tart flavor. What really stole the show, though, was the toast. I know that sounds crazy, but seriously I never knew toast could be so incredible. The bread was just amazing and the raspberry jam it came with was to die for. I would definitely want to come back here the next time I&#39;m in Chicago - there are so many more things I&#39;d like to try!

My friend Maddie M and I were going to catch an event on the U of C campus, and fellow Yelper Jen B recommended we try The Promontory since we&#39;d be in Hyde Park.Luckily I was able to grab us an online reservation at 5:30pm a few hours beforehand.  And I thought of how different it was from some of the restaurants in the Loop, where this would have been impossible (especially during CRW!).  It was a nice feeling, the accessibility of an alluring restaurant/bar, on University of Chicago campus with an eclectic bunch of the diners.  For some reason, this combination made for a beautiful restaurant space, and I just have a soft spot for college campuses.After reading a little online, I learned that Chef Jared Wentworth had worked with Dusek&#39;s and Longman &amp; Eagle, a group of restaurants that have an amazing track record.  Little surprise that The Promontory was excellent and exceeded any expectations.  Note that TP is also a music venue.

the-promontory-chicago,Maynard L.,O2U7QCLeDEBA3K2w4qwAsQ,#NAME?,"Lots of natural sunlight floods the restaurant at brunch. The dangling light bulbs and exposed ducts play well off the wooden table tops. I&#39;m obsessed with the accent boards hanging above the kitchen area. At night the Edison bulbs glow against the dark blue sky outside the bar front, and it feels like a cabin with hundreds of loved ones. Me and two friends order at the bar, nursing our drinks. Gannon and Noah order classic mimosas. I order the promontory palmer with passion fruit and mint because I&#39;ve got a long run later today after we go tagging. The atmosphere is a mix of younger looking parents with their children, all of them wearing North Face pullovers, groups of hip friends and U of C students nursing hangovers.  Gannon finishes his mimosa and tells Noah how you should sleep at least 8 hours a night. &#34;Who says?&#34; Noah asks. Gannon says you need to give the body enough time to produce its own hgh. &#34;Lions sleep 80 percent of the day,&#34; I interrupt. Promontory has a house DJ, and she plays a Jamie Xx track I haven&#39;t heard. Our waitress arrives promptly with our meals. Gannon ordered the fried chicken thigh sandwich with pickled slaw and comeback sauce. Noah ordered brioche french toast, drizzled with coconut creme anglaise, layered with banana jam, marshmallow, yuzu, and a vanilla wafer. I ordered the butternut squash quiche, though even now as it arrives and I see the braised kale and fermented kimchi, I&#39;m worried the pea tendril isn&#39;t exactly paleo. &#34;Sleep helps the brain process and store the day&#39;s sensory information,&#34; Gannon adds. &#34;Like we&#39;re a smartphone or tablet taking photos and videos and opening windows, and at night we plug into a desktop that stores all of this stuff, all of this information, we&#39;ve accrued while,&#34; he uses air quotes, &#34;we&#39;re &#39;on.&#39;&#34; Actually, I tell him, cutting into the quiche crust and watching the steam rise, our ancestors slept like six hours a night, and they had trouble falling asleep too. This scientist from UCLA studied a bunch of tribes from South America and Africa because they live as close to Paleolithic man as anyone alive. These tribes laid in bed for 8 hours, but only slept for 5 or 7. The difference is that they get a higher quality sleep than we do. They don&#39;t sleep with phones tucked under their pillow, or with laptops buffering bootleg movies they&#39;ll watch in the morning. They don&#39;t have all this electricity messing with their brain waves. Gannon talks behind the rim of his mimosa (&#34;Uh, yeah, that&#39;s what I was saying&#34;). What they need to do is have all of the electronics in their bedrooms on a surge protector that they can shut off at night. Noah points a fork at me with toast on the end and asks what about electrical outlets. Situate your bed away from any outlets, I say, and keep wireless devices like your phone outside of the bedroom to ensure harmful blue light doesn&#39;t disturb your circadian rhythm. How far should they be, now Gannon asks. At least eighteen feet, I say.

However, I went a couple of days ago, bringing new friends to this new discovery of mine.  Though it had the same vibe, the food was lacking.  It was well plated, as usual, but someone forgot to put yummy goodness they had before.  The fois gras was very gamey and minerally, not in a good way.  Someone ordered an app that was essentially hummus and babaganoosh fancied and the bread, which I think was supposed to be naan was greasy.

the-promontory-chicago,Katherine S.,1AELCxuTy3urVuTMbhIntw,0Q_5UXyv9hd39okUxqnM_A,"Here we go again, another lengthy review of  The Promontory from me. If you&#39;re not a foodie, and just wondering whether or not you should eat here... eat here. I think it is awesome that after every dining experience with The Promontory, I have so much to say. This restaurant is truly offering not just exceptional food, but an complete gastronomical experience. I arrived to The Promontory an hour earlier than my reservation, just to have a drink or two before dinner began. They were very accommodating to seat us an hour early at our reserved table with a view of the open kitchen. We always enjoy watching the chefs interact with one another as you can very plainly see they are one big playful family. After our pre-dinner bubbly, the Sommelier brought out our first course. The Maine lobster was perfectly chilled, tender, and plenty. The oyster mayo was really brightened up by the addition of mustard seeds, that lead to a perfectly creamy yet tangy sauce. The salmon roe that highlight the fish notes without overtaking the entire dish and of course are a beautiful addition to the presentation. The bed of yuzu toasted brioche added just the right amount of sweetness. The frisee played a role aesthetics as well as bringing a fresh and crisp factor to the dish. Overall, perfectly composed dish with an expertly paired with Ca&#39; Bosco Brut from Franciacorta.The second course was a well planned preview of the upcoming rich and earthy and away from the sweet and creamy by marrying the two flavor profiles. The transition was presented as a celery root agnolotti, with properly cooked pasta and subtle earthy celery filling. The creamy richness of the cauliflower soubise and roasted vegetable demi were cut by the crisp bitterness of the treviso. This course was beautifully paired with the refreshing Heidler Gruner Veltliner. A surprise course was added to the menu, the chef&#39;s experimental savory version of financiers. It was very obvious which of the two was onion flavored but he cheddar was not as pronounced. The cookies were moist and dense, and almost sticky. I loved that we got to partake in the chef&#39;s playful experiment! The last time I dined the Tuesday Tasting menu, the beef course was strip steak, beef cheek bourguinon, and roasted carrot puree. This time the beef course consisted of Waygu strip steak, beef cheek bourguinon, and roasted carrot puree... sound familiar? Basically, same exact dish but with an exponentially better execution and wine pairing the second go &#39;round. The steak was cooked to the chef&#39;s preference, as it should always be. A gorgeous steak presentation that melted like butter in your mouth. A satisfyingly rich and earthy course that paired so well with the comparable notes in the Jason Stephens Cabernet Sauvignon.The last savory course of the night was a Kentucky Burgoo composed of venison sausage, turkey roulade, smoke pork belly, braise butter beans, and the M.I.A. pickled okra. To my pleasant surprise, this dish was not overly salty as I had expected. With pork belly and venision sausage on the menu, I was prepared for the saltiness to shine. The pork belly was expertly salted, infused with natural smoke flavors, and was oh so tender. I was so happy to taste that the venison sausage was well seasoned, had an absence of game flavor, and great mouth feel from the casing to stuffing. As soon as I saw what was on the menu for dessert, I could not wait to have it in front of me. Coffee and Doughnuts paired with Boulder Beer Co.&#39;s Shake Chocolate Porter on nitro. When you write something like that on the menu, people are bound to get excited. I know I was excited, until I saw the dread grapefruit marmalade. Dessert came out and as always, gorgeously presented. A yeast doughnut, a doughnut hole filled with grapefruit marmalade, and coffee cremeux. I completely understand the concept of pairing acids with richly decedent flavors, but I can&#39;t handle the execution. Next time, I&#39;ll have to pass on the citrus marmalade. At The Promontory, there&#39;s an open kitchen where you can see all the chef&#39;s preparing the main dishes. However, there&#39;s an elusive, mad scientist of a pastry chef that hides in the back and conjours up wild desserts. Coffee foam, that&#39;s not so crazy, but not still not found on your average dessert. The kicker? Grapefruit powder. It looks like powered sugar but tastes like your eating afresh slice of grapefruit. Oh, the magical powers of molecular gastronomy.The third time must really be the charm, because I left completely entranced. Compared to my last experience, the food seemed to be more thoughtfully composed and purposefully prepared. The Sommelier did an exceptional job pairing with every dish, not just as a  compliment, but to complete the course.Well done.",557,5,4,5,112,14.6216,7.836,0.872,44.293000000000006,No

For what it&#39;s worth though, my friends more often than not report their food is great, so maybe it&#39;s just me.Cocktails: again, the menu drinks sound tasty, but the bartender situation here is seriously hit or miss. I usually order off menu, but nothing custom (Manhattan or boulevardier, for example), and I have almost never had a good drink here. When Promontory first opened they had two bartenders who were fantastic, one of whom designed the bar program. I quickly realized that there are dramatic disparities between their various bar staff. I have not seen either of those two excellent bartenders for at least a year now. Now I just order whiskey when I&#39;m here, basically.The space: looks fantastic in here.

All 5 of my friends loved their drinks too, and the mezcal drink was 2 of my friend&#39;s favorite. Now for the food, the menu is kind of eclectic and inspired from many different cuisines.  We ordered the Mezza spreads (great, the olive tapenade was the best), bok choy (didn&#39;t love the sauce), warm gougeres (amazing - like tomato soup inside a croissant almost), the roasted garlic falafel (the only dissapointing thing - the sauce used was too vinegary and everything except the falafel itself was doused in it. I wouldn&#39;t order this again), but the absolute best thing was the spring onion risotto.  I love risotto and this didn&#39;t disappoint - it was some of the best risotto I&#39;ve ever had! Def recommend. I&#39;m vegetarian so I didn&#39;t try these but my friend ordered the lamb tartare, the mussels and kalbi beef short ribs and it sounded like they loved all of them. We also ordered the smores souffle for dessert which takes 15 min which was great. I also got a dessert wine which I never do so that was fun, def a great way to finish dinner. All in all this is definitely a place I&#39;d go back to and recommend.",157,4,3,5,54,8.908500000000002,4.844,0.06,9.096,No

(The &#34;con Chile&#34; is a standout, although I think it may be disappearing from the menu for a while.)  Nice patio too.The food is a little fancier and more expensive than mere happy-hour grub, but I like the amount of interesting vegetables they have.

Our friends, who live in Hyde Park, go here a lot and the staff was great. Food was also outstanding. Not being too familiar with the area, we found The Promontory a little hard to find. It&#39;s behind the AKIRA, BTW. We parked in the lot behind the restaurant and got a little turned around and walked up the stairs to the 2nd floor.  We found ourselves in the middle of a kids Halloween event.  We eventually found our way downstairs and to the restaurant.  I think all of us went with the &#34;Point&#34; breakfast. I have to declare the potatoes the best breakfast potatoes ever! they were surprisingly crispy.  Scrambled eggs and pork belly were good.  The only thing I didn&#39;t care for was the &#34;beermosa&#34;. The combination of beer and OJ just didn&#39;t work for me.

Some of the dishes were a tad pricey for the portion size. A couple of us really enjoyed our drinks but the Bloody Mary was thin/watery. I would maybe come back to see how dinner service is...maybe.Review of Service: We came for brunch on a Sunday. We were surprised to find that there was NO wait and several open tables, yet we waited at least 15 minutes before being seated. The hostess just seemed disorganized and scattered- first tells us our table is being set inside since it recently rained and some of the benches outside are still wet (we agreed), then offers a table outside, so we gladly accept. Several minutes later, two other parties of similar size (we had a party of 5) come in and before we know it, both the table inside and the table we thought they were setting for us outside are given away to the other parties. It wasn&#39;t until someone from my group brought this up to the host that they began setting a different table outside for our party. When we finally got to our table, we noted that there was only space for 4 and asked that we get a chair for one end. The hostess suggested that 3 of us sit on the bench, which would have been very cramped given the size of the tables. So we just got our own chair and reset the table to fit our group. We still only had 4 app plates on the table but at that point we could be bothered to say anything. I think maybe the hostess just needed extra help setting the tables but it put a damper on the overall experience.",179,3,2,2,20,1.4806,1.304,0.879,12.818,No

We didn&#39;t have reservations, but we were seated right away since we were one of the first customers there when they opened for the evening.  We were probably there for about an hour, and it wasn&#39;t too long until seats began to fill up so I would suggest making reservations if you want to avoid a wait. I had a big lunch, so I ended up getting the mezzo spreads and the blended zombie. I only really liked a couple of the spreads from the mezzo spreads plate, but I don&#39;t regret getting this appetizer.  The blended zombie was a perfect 10. The zombie was refreshing, balanced, and perfectly blended (no chunks of ice). My boyfriend got the lamb burger which he said was good. I tried one of my boyfriends chickpea fries that came with his burger, and it was excellent.The service was okay, but our waitress acted really snooty the whole time, so I would never want her again.

We sat on the beautiful patio.  Service was wonderful, attentive and helpful. The food--we tried a variety of smaller plates including roast asparagus, burrata, short ribs, and roast cauliflower--was very good. So were the cocktails. It was such a good experience overall that when my friend asked me where we should have lunch the following day, I said let&#39;s go to The Promontory. Today&#39;s lunch experience was different. It was raining, and we sat inside, which also has a nice atmosphere. Although the restaurant wasn&#39;t very crowded, we frequently felt forgotten. We each ordered a bowl of the soup special (asparagus soup, which was very good), and a plate of meze spreads with bread and chickpea fries to share. The soup took forever to arrive. We watched as tables around us got served burgers, sandwiches, salads, and so forth. I couldn&#39;t imagine what was taking the soup so long. Nobody spoke to us to let us know about any problem. When the soup finally came, we ate it pretty quickly because we were so hungry, and then there was another long interval prior to the rest of our meal being delivered. Further, the meze plate was missing an item. When I asked the server about the missing item, she checked with the kitchen to confirm they were out of it. Nobody offered to provide a substitute or inquired whether we still wanted it. Frankly, if I&#39;d known that item wouldn&#39;t be included, I would have ordered something else. As things stood, I remained too hungry and it was really too late to quibble. To give an idea of how long things took for this light order, we arrived at the restaurant around 12:20 and didn&#39;t get out till 2:15. We were shocked, until we remembered how long we had been kept waiting for the soup.

It was really crowded and luckily we had made reservations so didn&#39;t wait long to be seated. The atmosphere/decor is really cool and the outdoor seating is beautiful. The drinks and food are all a hit or miss. Amongst the items we got: The Sunset (great - very refreshing), a purple cocktail with lavender (disgusting - tasted bitter and soapy), Warm Gourgeres (so gross - the puff pastry was good but the cheesey filling tasted like year old cheese whiz), Beef Short Rib (delicious - well seasoned but expensive for a small amount....and I&#39;ve had much better in Chinatown), Double Beef Burger (tasty - although how can you mess up a burger?), Green Circle Farms Chicken (average - chicken is moist, cornbread and greens are an embarrassment to Southern cuisine), Grilled Gulf Prawns (really good - prawns were amazing, the sides that comes with it are just ok / kind of a throw away), Grilled Bluefin Tuna (average and overpriced), Beignets (actual beignets were really good but all of the extra sauces and creams were bad), Egg Custard with Tarragon Cake (really good and unique), Carrot and Walnut Cake (disgusting - it was dry and mealy; we each took 1 bite and couldn&#39;t eat anymore). Overall you&#39;re taking a chance ordering anything because the whole menu is such a toss up. As others have said, their food/drink reeks of trying too hard. Most dishes were overcomplicated and unfortunately the basics were just not done right. Although I appreciate more semi-upscale places coming to HP, I thought that for the most part many items were overpriced. Anyway, I know food is very subjective so I was really going to rate this place higher for food even though I personally did not like everything, but unfortunately the service was horrible.

She rolled her eyes several times when we placed our orders and rushed us throughout our entire time there (she refused to put in our app orders without also ordering our entrees - she mentioned it would take longer for our entrees to come out but we mentioned we were in no rush).

I prefer bacon or something else to infuse it with savory flavor.  Thier brussel sprouts contain more vegetables such as soy beans.  The flavor is clean and if you&#39;re a vegetarian you&#39;ll probably love it.  I also ordered the fresh pasta.  Again, a vegetarian dish that had small squared butternut squash.

the-promontory-chicago,Suzanne E.,UgwRKo3Koe4QJU8Z4stbZA,Iz2qKVZobAZuVdV8TyJ6xA,"The food, drinks and servers were great, but I had made a reservation for a table for six on the patio because it can get way too loud inside and we wanted to be able to hear each other on a special occasion with friends coming in from out of town. The reservation I made specified that we were to be seated outdoors.  I arrived on time and said we had a reservation for six on the patio. The hostess glibly informed me that they didn&#39;t take reservations for the patio, and that if we wanted to get on the waiting list it would be a 45-minute wait.  She clearly did not see it as a problem that we had been told we were reserving an outdoor space--and I see her point; after all, we were only the fucking customers at an expensive restaurant, so why bother with what we want or try to resolve the problem?  This is the new tarted-up Hyde Park we&#39;re all supposed to have been waiting for with bated breath, per the promo posters around the area of 53rd and Lake Park . . .Time was tight so we said OK, we would eat inside. The music, which is usually beautiful, was some ghastly dance music that clattered off the walls and it was hard to hear anyone who wasn&#39;t next to you. I explained the situation to my waiter and asked him to please change the music to something more contemplative if we couldn&#39;t be outside. He totally got it and within five minutes we WERE outside. Thank goodness.  The takeaway I have is a) I will never make PLANS to eat here again; b) if you make reservations through their website, don&#39;t believe what they tell you; and c) my waiter was brilliant. This is a good place to poke your nose into and see what the music is and what seats are available, but the experience is not remotely reliable. My guest and I walked back inside an hour and a half later and she called to me over the ambient noise that we would never have been able to hear each other inside at ALL at the volume to which it had escalated, and man was she right.  The whole experience is propelling me to less glamourous alternatives like Pizza Capri and the Sit-Down for the next social excursion--or maybe just downtown.",211,2,1,4,-1,3.8391,2.085,0.19,12.725999999999999,No

The prices seem similar, but I just like my experience in Pilsen better. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth trekking to Hyde Park from elsewhere just for a meal here. The space is very cool. I think next time I come here it will be for drinks because the patio is breezy and the bar area is warm and inviting. Also kudos for not placing the tables rightnexttoeachother (don&#39;t you hate when someone&#39;s arse is in your face just because they&#39;re trying to shimmy between tables?). The food was pretty good. I had the cornbread panzanella (will pass on this next time as it was pretty forgettable and not well composed) and the pork/fried clam po boy (tasty, but had to knife-and-fork it because it was impossible to eat--them fries doe, they were crispy and fatty the way I like &#39;em). I had the carbonated daiquiri to drink and it was major blerg--first, it tasted nothing like the name would suggest, and it had so much lime juice that hubs almost spit it out when he tried a taste. The service was OK except for this: friends told the waitress they&#39;d order wine when their meals came, and she insisted on taking the order then so that she could bring the wine out *with* the food. OK. Food came, no wine. Nearly halfway through our meal, no wine. Had to ask to bring the wine. Probably wouldn&#39;t have been a big deal if she hadn&#39;t made a point to tell us it would come out with the food.To be sure, there was nothing *wrong* with the experience.

I&#39;m always trying to find a place to meet a friend for breakfast and we are early birds. I like to meet people at 7am or so. Get together early and catch up and then we can each go about our respective days and such (run errands or whatever). Found this place on the Yelp app and just got a good vibe from it. LOVED the name (not gonna lie) and liked the idea of Southern comfort food, which is a nice change of pace from the regular ole breakfast I usually get.I arrived at 7am today and one of the owners sat me down and was super friendly. I felt like I was part of the family! His wife (the other owner) arrived shortly thereafter. Coffee was fresh and hot and we chatted while I awaited my friend&#39;s arrival. We both ordered the same plate, on special: chicken fried steak with biscuits and a side of eggs and has browns. The food was really, really good. Made to order and tasted fresh and homemade -just what I needed! A little comfort food for a long overdue &#34;catch up&#34; session with a childhood friend.Really cool vibe, too. -Kind of an upscale country bar. Music was on, other locals started to come in. A good crowd was forming by the time we left (around 9:30 or so). Overall, a very cool place I am very grateful to have found (despite likely having driven by it, oh, 100 times.)

As soon as the order was placed the food came almost instantaneously.  Along with the 8 piece chicken we also ordered the Mac &amp; cheese, hush puppies and potatoes.  The chicken that came out was very disappointing compared to the 5 star chicken I received the previous times that I ate there.  It was very dry and tasted like it had been sitting for a long time as opposed to the very tender, moist chicken that was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The sides except the hush puppies were nothing to write home about.  The Mac and cheese was ok, but the potatoes were terrible, soggy and no flavor (never again). Needless to say I was very disappointed after telling my wife how great the chicken was.I mentioned this to Diana our waitress and she was very responsive offering to replace the 4 remaining pieces of chicken with 4 freshly cooked pieces &amp; the potatoes with a different side of collard greens.  Tim the owner came over and apologized profusely for the quality of food that was served.

Blink too fast and you&#39;ll miss both driving through! I went with the popular food item, the shrimp po&#39; boy, side of fries, and a Pepsi. It was all way too expensive at $14. They could at least include the beverage, sold separately, in their combos. Even if the drink was included, I&#39;d still complain about the price I paid for just the fries and sandwich.It&#39;s really nothing to write home about. I will say this place nails it in the quality of the tomatoes they use on their sandwiches. They are a deep, dark red and I am not afraid to eat them. You know what I mean. You go to some places and the tomatoes are so stiff and barely pink, you wonder if they were even grown in the ground! My shrimp po&#39; boy could have used more shrimp for what I paid. I suspected the sandwich wouldn&#39;t have enough shrimp before I even walked into the place. Not so much from the photos -- you can&#39;t tell. The sandwich is like all Po&#39; Boys, a top-heavy food item, loaded with too much iceberg lettuce in such a way that wherever you take your first bite, everything falls out of the other end. Otherwise the sandwich tasted fine. They even give you extra sauce for your sandwich, which I just used for the fries.Speaking of french fries, they could do better. They weren&#39;t gooey enough on the inside, nor crispy enough on the outside. Even the sauce wasn&#39;t fatty enough to mask the dryness of the fries. I think yelpers on here go for the mac &#39;n cheese. Since I was taking my order to go, I didn&#39;t want the mac &#39;n cheese because it gets cold too fast and I like it super fresh. For such a small space, the restaurant is so cute, and it&#39;s clean. It almost looks like a diner and it&#39;s BYOB. They even serve coffee. I think the charm in Mother Cluckers is more about sitting down to eat in this cozy setting, than it is about the food.

Good.I hate to write such a lengthy review, but that&#39;s how you know this place was the bomb dot com. Read on:We, my boyfriend (Vic) and I, first heard about this place through my Vic&#39;s dad while visiting him over a weekend a few months ago. The chicken was a few hours old, but still good after heating it up. Vic and I decided to go to the actual establishment for dinner one night. We both ordered a two-piece chicken combo and it came with two sides. What we ate:- Chicken- Mac and cheese- Baked beans- Collard greens- Hush puppiesWe loved everything! Definitely left feeling satisfied. The place is small, but wasn&#39;t too busy and we were able to find a table right away and food came out quickly.Then last night we decided to grab dinner here again since it had been a few months. It was packed and they were fulfilling what seemed like a thousand to-go orders. However, our wait still wasn&#39;t very long and our food came out in a good amount of time. One of the women bussing the tables was extremely accommodating helping those who were staying to dine in secure tables. What we ate:- Chicken and waffles- Shrimp Po Boy sandwichWe were completely satisfied with both dishes. Words cannot explain how delicious the Shrimp Po Boy was though. That was ahhhhmazing. They use a lobster roll and uuuggghhh I turned into the lady that makes those uncomfortable noises of delight when she eats. It was that good. I think I found my go-to item. Vic and I normally share our food when we go out to eat, but I did NOT want to share with him (I still did though because you can&#39;t let the love of your life miss out on something this good - cue the awes). But seriously. If you try anything, try this first.We stayed for dessert and coffee. Their sweet potato pie was soooo good. I pretty much ate the entire thing by myself sharing pieces with Vic here and there. He doesn&#39;t love dessert as much as I do, but he had more than he normally does because it was delicious. Overall, we obviously have loved coming here both times and will definitely be back soon.

The cashier was really friendly and helpful with suggestions. I really wanted to try a po-boy that night, but the broasted chicken was calling my name!

Perfectly seasoned...great flavor...not bland! It was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside! Mac-n-Cheese - It was OK. I probably won&#39;t get it again...too reminiscent of something out of a box. It wasn&#39;t horrible...but, I&#39;d like to try a different side next time. Mashed potatoes - They were good. I&#39;m pretty sure they use red potatoes. If you like the really creamy kind of mashed potatoes, you prob won&#39;t like these...they were a bit more chunky. Hush puppies - Now, I always thought I didn&#39;t like hush puppies...but, I loved these!!!

I will definitely get these again!!! Coleslaw - This is more of the hubby&#39;s thing...I didn&#39;t try it. My husband and I wanted some type of dipping sauce for our chicken/hush puppies and one of the ones they gave us was SOOOOO good.

Their specialty is &#34;broasted&#34; chicken, which is sort of a slightly less fattening take on fried chicken.  I ordered the 2-piece chicken meal.  For my two sides I chose collard greens and mac &amp; cheese, and I chose hush puppies over the biscuit.  The chicken is pretty good with a crackling skin, but I&#39;m not sure if it is crave-worthy as some fried chicken I have consumed elsewhere.  The two sides I had were OK but I would probably try other sides next time.  The hush puppies also have a crackling crunch to them similar to the pieces of chicken.  There are some other interesting food selections and specials, so I would not mind another meal here sometime.The service here is prompt and friendly.

Saw all the great reviews for this spot, and decided to give it a try. Very glad we did. The chicken was absolutely delicious - extremely fresh (fried up while we were there). We both thought the hush puppies and biscuits were very good, but I think they need to put some honey on the table along with the jams and jellies. The coleslaw was excellent - freshly made, crunchy, light - not your typical. The Mac and cheese was made with jalape’±os cheese, I think. Not my favorite, but my husband likes.It appeared they had more take out orders than eat-in at the time we were there, but they have a nice little dining area, and we were very comfortable and content on a cold February evening! Prices were very reasonable and they actually threw in some extra hush puppies and a small bread pudding! I don&#39;t think they serve any alcohol, beer or wine. That might be nice for the future. Best of all was the extraordinarily welcoming attention we (and all the other customers we observed) received. It was clear they had some long time regulars!

You get a choice of two sides and the option between a biscuit or hush puppies. The biscuit was okay, super fluffy but hardly any flavor. The hush puppies were the truth and definite must have! The ribs were sensational fall off the bone succulent tender juicy and perfectly tangy. The fries were perfectly crunchy and salty and the chicken was super crunchy too. So so good. The Mac and cheese was okay not too much flavor but super creamy if you&#39;re into that. Overall, holler at the ribs, chicken and hush puppies without a doubt.

Naansense combats that issue by offering an Americanized model: single-serving meals with plenty of options.You start with a base (naanwich, salad, rice bowl, or quinoa for an extra $2)You then add a protein (chicken, farmer&#39;s cheese (paneer) for an extra $1, lamb for an extra $2, or roasted veggies) You then choose a sauce (tikka, madras, korma, vindaloo)Last but not least, you add toppings (pickled onions, cabbage slaw, tomatoes, cucumbers, cilantro) and dressings (cool garlic, sweet-n-tart (pretty sure this is tamarind), green mint, and fire red.I like that Naansense has easily accessible markers for vegan and gluten-free options.

My fianc’© and I are in Chicago for the weekend and obviously rely on Yelp for our food needs... And we stumbled upon NaanSense. First, think Indian qdoba. You can choose a Naanwhich, a rice bowl or a salad. One protein (chicken, lamb, farmers cheese, chickpeas, or roasted veggies) and a sauce (savory tomato/tikka/mild, cashew ginger/korma/mild, spiced coconut/madras/medium or red chili/vindaloo/hot)  topped with fresh veggies (picketed onions, cabbage slaw, cucumbers, tomatoes and cilantro).  All the choices look delicious! I personally went with the salad, roasted veggies, all toppings and a cool garlic dressing on the side. In was fantastic. There was a line the whole time we were there and people just kept coming in.. Although no one was leaving, ha. People were enjoying their meals and chatting and eating. I didn&#39;t want to leave either, but I felt bad so we got up to give our table away. Needed to say I would go back. The space was quaint, the service was quick, and the food was fantastic.

I also had all the toppings and chose the mint sauce as well as the tamarind sauce.When I watched them make my salad, I was kind of wondering how all of this was going to work out. The soupy korma sauce all over a salad? It was kind of off putting. Maybe a salad isn&#39;t the way to go here, but that is what I ordered. My friend had the lamb salad and he chose the vindaloo sauce. The vindaloo sauce is labeled as being very spicy, but my friend said it was not very hot at all. The sauces were a little bland for our liking. I kept wishing that my lunch was more flavorful. Usually Indian food is bursting with flavor but this was kind of meh. The korma sauce should have been more silky/creamy. The tamarind sauce was less tangy than the sauce I usually get at Indian restaurants and was almost watery. Also, the naan that came with it was kind of like a sad little pita/naan hybrid.

naansense-chicago,Ryan L.,aCptbfrrIwaoJbc478XBRg,5fUiuWO8sPsxzgY51_zb_A,"I have worked in the Loop for 2.5 years and generally stick to Chipotle, Potbelly&#39;s, etc. for lunch or Haute Sausage when I want to really indulge over the lunch hour. Recently I stumbled across Naansense and decided to give it a try. My sense of adventure when it comes to Indian food is almost nonexistent as I can&#39;t handle any spice so I opted for a rice bowl with lamb, tomatoes, with the tikka sauce. Unfortunately when I paid for my food I wasn&#39;t able to eat it there because there is pretty much no seating available over the lunch hour. I didn&#39;t count the number of tables but I swear this place can&#39;t seat more than 15 people without the fire department shutting them down for overcrowding.Anyway, after a cold walk back to my office I was floored at how delicious my lunch was. The lamb was cooked well and the tikka sauce was flavorful and generally not very spicy. I was disappointed with the tiny piece of naan you get with your meal there too and would have liked a little more given the size of the bowl you receive for the rice. For a place called &#34;Naansense&#34; you&#39;d expect naan to be a big focus of each meal but apparently not.The food at Naansense is great but due to the lack of seating and the small amount of naan you&#39;re given I can&#39;t give 5 stars. I guess 4 stars it is! Yum.",140,4,2,2,14,1.241,0.862,0.44199999999999995,11.696000000000002,No

I usually get a bowl because the naanwich can get messy lol the bowl makes it easier to eat and you can even get a little naan on the side.I&#39;ve read some negative reviews of the mango lassi but I love it. It is nicely flavored and it has a thick texture that I can&#39;t find at other Indian restaurants.I am always referring my friends here and meeting people for lunch here because it&#39;s that good!

I tried the tikka chicken on rice, the korma chicken on salad, and the lamb naanwich on Korma.  I would have guessed the naanwich would be the signature item, but it can be a bit of a sloppy mess, and I ended up eating it with a plastic knife and fork instead of like a burrito.  So if I ate here regularly, I&#39;d probably be eating more of the salad or rice options. I was glad to get there at 12:05 and just beat the rush - this place gets busy!

It was delicious. If you like spicy like I do, then the vindaloo and red pepper chutney is for you. Honestly, I should have gotten a &#39;cooler&#39; chutney (garlic yogurt) because my mouth was on fire, although I enjoyed it...but hot on hot is def a dangerous combo. The chicken itself was moist and juicy and the toppings were quite fresh. However, the veggie samosa was just okay and find Bombay Wrap&#39;s samosas to be much better.Their service was splendid. Even though the wait in line was around a half hour that afternoon, the staff was very friendly and did the best they could, as the line did move along. They ran out of naan for a quick second and reassured us that fresh ones will be out in a minute, in which it did.

It&#39;s nice going into a dining establishment where the staff is either knowledgeable about the offerings they have or they&#39;re at least conversational.

The food is great, but my palate has been exposed to Indian food in India, London, Toronto, and along Chicago&#39;s Devon Street such that my take on fast food Indian is unfair.There are some wraps, salad bowls, and wraps that I will try in the future.

Have yet to actually come to the location and dine in so I can&#39;t speak to the service or ambience, but having ordered here last night I can say that I now have a new reliable Malaysian place to order from in the city. Tried out the Char Koay Teow and the Rendang Chicken, but made a few adjustments to the Char Koay Teow so that it was half spice and with tofu in lieu of squid. In a short 50 minutes, the food was delivered, and we dug in. These two dishes seemed pretty popular, so I thought it would be a good measure of some of their best showings. The Chicken Rendang came with pieces of sliced chicken, with soft pieces of eggplant and string beans thrown in there as well. I&#39;m not really all too sure what I was expecting; to be fair I haven&#39;t had much as far as rending goes, but the sauce was very fragrant of coconut milk and honestly pretty similar to a penang curry. Not to say that&#39;s a bad though though, as I typically love penang curry, but that&#39;s as far as the Chicken Rendang was to me. A very tasty, but otherwise none too exciting, rendition of a dish that I already know and love. The Char Koay Teow however I thought was a real crowd pleaser, as it had medium thick flat noodles stir fried with soy sauce, chili, shrimp, squid, bean sprouts, eggs, and Chinese sausage. What was surprising to me was the depth of spice and fragrance in the dish; While I&#39;ve had plenty of similar dishes, Serai&#39;s version was perfectly cooked, with wok-kissed noodles and plenty of toppings. I would order this every time without pause. With one dish that was really stellar and another that was good as well, it goes without saying that I can&#39;t wait to try out the rest of Serai&#39;s unique offerings. With a fairly diverse menu of cross-cultural options, I&#39;m sure it has enough to keep both newcomers and experts in Asian cuisine interested.",220,4,2,5,33,5.0671,1.7859999999999998,0.242,11.972000000000001,No

The sauce was very flavorful! I do wish the piece of bread was a little bigger so that I could finish all the curry sauce.Nasi Lemak with Ayam Merah (chicken) - This traditional dish was executed perfectly! The sauce on the chicken was delicious and paired well with the rice and fried egg.Char Koay Teow - Flat noodles stir fried over very high heat with light and dark soy sauce, chili, shrimps, squids, bean sprouts and Chinese sausage. I thought the noodles were tasty and I especially liked the pieces of squid.The guy who I believe is the owner asked us if we like coconut and after we said yes, he brought us complimentary coconut pudding.

serai-chicago,Andy N.,mphvb6MRmPgnIT8pmU-x0w,qrJ0DFBLKQpBw5CNCHTxEw,"Finally, a Malay restaurant has come about in the Chicago-land area that does not necessarily require a car to get there. My friend from out of town stopped by Serai after other establishments close by had an hour long wait. Thanks to Yelp, we were able to walk a few blocks down to enjoy some tastes of Southeast Asia.Serai is a definite 3.5 for me, but I&#39;ve bumped it up given it&#39;s our go-to choice now in Chicago. Malaysian food is grounded in its fresh ingredients and flavors, and if I was able to ever find cuisine similar to food in Penang, I&#39;d be a happy camper! For being here in the Midwest, Serai does its best and I am super grateful.The restaurant is lovely and has a great ambiance. BYOB is also what makes this a killer place- my cheap bottle of wine was tantalizing to say the least. During our visit, we ordered three signature Malay dishes: Roti Canai, Char Kwey Teow, and Seafood Laksa.The roti was very good; warm, fluff, and easy to tear to dip into the curry. Our laksa came in huge portions but I think it lacked some flavor in the broth. Char Kwey Teow was fantastic with its bold soy flavors. Definitely recommend getting a plate to share with a large group of people.Thanks Serai for bringing about some more Southeast Asian flavors to the city.Parking is available on the street.",156,4,3,5,57,5.744800000000001,3.3669999999999995,0.391,11.242000000000003,No
serai-chicago,Jessica M.,U11j0md4DV59nXD6kdb0KA,cUMI6r637OwCUpWtbuz5pA,"As one of the few Malaysian/Indonesian eateries in Chicago, Serai definitely has the appeal. But they&#39;re tamed to please the crowd and has yet to have me on a leash.Our party of three shared the following:Roti pratha - It was one piece of flat bread and one bowl of curry sauce. The sauce was extremely runny and filled with a few pieces of chicken and potatoes. Flavors were vibrant but portions were odd in which it was rather lonesome for one piece of flat bread to swim in a bowl of sauce. So I&#39;d suggest you ordering a bowl of rice to finish up that essence.Lamb rendang - Chunky, tender pieces of lamb were soaked in a beautiful, dark, and caramelized sauce with hints of lemongrass and ginger. It was mildly spicy and went perfectly with the rice.Nasi goreng - I had high anticipation for this heap of fried rice topped with a fried egg but it under-performed. In English terms, it&#39;s Malaysian spicy shrimp paste fried rice with shrimp and basil. I was expecting my olfactories and tastes buds to be under aggressive attack from the fermented, salted, and ground shrimp. To my dismay, the ingredient was minimally used and the fried rice could easily be disregarded. Char koay teow - This was a popular item that consisted of Malaysian flat noodle, chili, shrimp, squid, bean sprouts, chopped chives, and Chinese sausage. It was very plentiful in ingredients and had a slight kick to it. This dish might come off slightly greasy but that is to be expected with this type of flat noodle. Enough cooking oil is necessary to prevent the noodles from sticking to the wok and coming off charred. Service was slightly inefficient but tryingly attentive due to various reasons, one being a large birthday party to attend to. Street parking was relatively easy and public transportation is close enough. At about $20 per person, I&#39;d say this is a decent way to be eased into a cuisine you&#39;ve never had before.",221,3,1,3,7,2.8548999999999998,1.951,0.681,16.368,No

From the outside, it doesn&#39;t look like this place is anything, but once you step in, it&#39;s pretty roomy.

Anyways, the dec’_r was nice... and this place is Bee-yob, which I guess according to my dinner companion, its a big deal.We ordered the Roti Pratha, Panang Chicken Curry, and Green Curry Chicken. The Roti Pratha was REEEEALLY good. The roti, which is Indian bread, had the perfect texture and flaky crunch, and the curry chicken and potatoes dipping sauce it was served with was extremely flavorful.The panang chicken curry, served with green bean, eggplant, baby corn (blech) in an amazing panang curry was really good too. The sauce was extremely flavorful and I really liked the green beans as it had the right amount of crunch... and the eggplant was absolutely tasty.The Green curry chicken was similar to the Panang curry. It had the similar toppings -- served with green bean, eggplant, broccoli, onion, baby corn and a green coconut broth.The servers and staff were super nice and very attentive, and the customer service was phenomenal. BATHROOM REVIEW -- Super clean and featuring several stalls, the bathroom was really spacious, bright, and inviting.

I may have to frequent Serai now....it&#39;s probably the best (okay...almost only) option in Chi-town.Service was great.

The flavors are good but are slightly tamed for the Midwestern palates. I went straight to the items I missed having the most and a few other apps I haven&#39;t heard of before.- Nasi Lemak - not a bad reintroduction for me. This can be quite a foreign option for those not so adventurous diners....cuz there is some cold &#34;sides&#34; like the mild onion and anchovy &#34;relish&#34; a fried egg and the Asian crisp or papad (maybe the English translation for this is lentil/rice wafer?). Anyway - it is a good intro for anyone but I&#39;d rather go straight for the curry and rice!- We got the beef rendang with the nasi lemak. Essentially beef curry with the tender pieces of beef. the curry was flavorful - I would get this again but the big portion...even though my favorite place in Queens still beats Serai.- Char Koay Teow - we really enjoyed Serai&#39;s version of this. It may be a go-to item next time. - Cumin lamb skewers - very good app. it was not so gamey so we liked it. - Gado-gado salad was a new dish for me. It was good to try but the entrees has this beat For those mid-westerners not well versed in Malaysian cuisine, the Char Koay Teow is good intro as is the beef or lamb rendang. Can&#39;t wait to try other stuff like the curry laksa or the mee goreng next time.",203,4,2,5,20,6.41,3.945,0.23,16.823999999999998,No

The waitress was so helpful in her recommendations so we steered away from just the usual Chinese/Thai dish. We started off with the Roti Pratha, based on recommendations from fellow Yelpers which was so favorable and the perfect portion for two. For our main course, we got the popular dish Char Koay Teow which had flat noodles and a bunch of fresh seafood - yum, as well as the waitress&#39;s personal favorite the Panang Beef Curry. HOLY #*$! I was a BIG fan of both and was completely shocked by the Panang Beef Curry as I never really ever get curry dishes, the beef was SO tender and the curry was just so favorable. Great portions and an even better price. We also got the Coconut Pudding - not for me, but my boyfriend devoured it.

Clay pot tofu...good sized portion, fresh and flavorful. Rendang beef with coconut rice plate, including fried egg, sauteed onion Etc., nicely presented and quite tasty.The Laksa, which is excellent, is where Serai and I have a philosophical divide. Again let me be clear in that the Laksa is delicious, just a spiced and flavored differently than the Laksa I am used to eating throughout S.E. Asia where I worked for some years  ( my version is spicier with more complex / savory spice flavors and a &#34;sour node&#34;). And yes, I get that there are numerous regional variations of Laksa and everyone has their own favorites, but, I&#39;m just trying, and yes albeit for perhaps somewhat selfish reasons, to get what I believe will ultimately be a preferred Laksa version on the menu, (which can be alongside the current version) and, I will be so bold as to say that in a Laksa throw down, I am confident that my version will prevail. I know they just opened so no pressure or anything, but maybe eventually at some point in the future we need a Laksa throw down so that the people can decide this one.  A challenge..? Perhaps!

The pad Thai was overly potent on spices which kind of bothered my nose but it was good , the crab rangoon for appetizers was good so we ordered 2 of them .

We&#39;ve already been a handful of times and have enjoyed almost all the food we&#39;ve had.We&#39;ve tried the Roti Pratha (Roti Canai), Pot Stickers, Char Kuey Teow, Nasi Lemak with rendang beef, Indonesian Fried Rice, Mango Fried Rice, Tofu Claypot, Szechuan fish, and both the Coconut dessert and the Black Rice dessert.I loooove Roti Canai and could probably live off it. Theirs is excellent - the flaky pancake and the delicious curry dip that comes with.  My first world problem is that I always have leftover curry and nothing left to dip. The pot stickers are possibly homemade and are quite large and have a thick chewy skin (that&#39;s what she said?). The Char Kuey Teow was full of wok flavor and also delicious - good quality shrimp and Chinese sausage cooked with it. Those two dishes were my faves. The Nasi Lemak was good, but I think I actually prefer Fat Rice&#39;s version (more ingredients and texture) -- though I did appreciate the deep fried over easy egg they served with it. The Rendang Beef had vibrant flavors but was a bit too lemongrass-y for my tastes. I have a weird thing with lemongrass that if it&#39;s too strong it makes the dish taste like soap to me. The Indonesian fried rice had a great ginger flavor and came with a fried leg/thigh, but I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again.  I recommend the Mango fried rice instead -- it&#39;s much more unique -- if you&#39;ve had Omelette Rice then you&#39;ll be familiar. It&#39;s basically a fried rice wrapped in a thin egg omelette. I&#39;ve tried it make it, it takes skills. Fresh mango is also mixed in -- so depending on the season, you may get unripen mango. The Claypot Tofu is a little too cornstarchy, but otherwise a good mix of veggies and very tender tofu.  The Szechuan fish filet wasn&#39;t my favorite, it&#39;s a little overfried, but if you like Lao Sze Chuan&#39;s dry chili chicken, you&#39;ll probably like this. Of the two desserts, I prefer the coconut dessert - it&#39;s coconut pudding in a coconut. Take full advantage and scrape out the meat after finishing the pudding.Serai definitely feels a family establishment and sometimes you just crave homemade food.

We started with the Roti Pratha, which was just okay. The chicken curry was really good, but I felt like the bread itself was a little on the soft side. It was very nice and flaky though! I opted for the Mee Goreng based on a recommendation from my Singaporean friend, which is a stir fried noodle dish with this crazy addictive and flavorful sauce with shrimp, bean sprouts, tofu, potatoes, and other good things. Usually I get bored of stir fried noodle dishes really fast, but this was awesome. I finished the whole dish and was insanely stuffed in the end. I&#39;d absolutely order this again.

A good hainan chicken should have a burst of flavour that come through the meat itself. I felt like I was eating a dish filled with gigantic pieces of dry flavourless chicken breast. The thought of having to finish the leftover was daunting --- i ended up taking most of the whole dish home and made chicken rice soup since i didn&#39;t want to just throw it away.The watercress with shrimp paste was really greasy...it was one of my childhood favourite since my mom used to make that all the time before she stopped using shrimp paste in her dishes...My fiance ordered a malaysian dish that a piece of fried chicken topped with some sauces...it came with some other fixings and rice....but honestly, this dish tasted just like how I described here...i bet you could get that sauce at some asian grocery store and put it on any fried chicken.",120,2,1,2,-7,1.9926,0.534,0.101,4.365,No

Unfortunately, it&#39;s not common in the US even though it&#39;s known as one of the best cuisines in the entire world. I have many Malaysian friends who have cooked for me, and fell even more in love with the food after spending a few weeks there. I always tell some friends in Chicago they have no idea what they&#39;re missing out on and they remain kind of clueless about it.There used to be a Malaysian restaurant in Chinatown, but it burned down something like 8 years ago. There are a few restaurants in Chicago here and there serving a Malaysian dish or two, but almost none of them (except one) was doing it very well. There are only a few full on Malaysian restaurants in the suburbs and that&#39;s the only way to get it, unless you find yourself at a friend&#39;s place or a Merdeka Day celebration.You can understand the excitement I had when I found out the city was getting a legitimate Malaysian restaurant and I wouldn&#39;t have to go to the suburbs to find such an establishment. I actually went opening day, but only had a few things to eat. I came back with more people so we could have more.Everything was very good there. The Roti Paratha (canai) was great. The roti is pretty obviously homemade and better than any I&#39;ve had in the US yet. The char koay teow was very good with a nice char flavor. The chicken satay is awesome and yet again probably the best I&#39;ve had in the US. Might not be for everyone, but it has a nice lemongrass flavor. Might not be for everyone, but it was awesome. The dipping sauce is good enough to eat straight up. Both the Sambal Shrimp and Beef Rendang were really good too. Coconut pudding was great too.The space itself is nice and clean and they&#39;ll be opening up the other half (with a bar) soon enough. They also told me they&#39;re going to have a patio in the summer - can&#39;t wait for that! Service wise, it was very good. The owners are really nice and cool and legitimately want you to pick the right dishes and have the best food.They have food from other Asian countries as well like Thailand and China, but you could say this is primarily a Malaysian restaurant that has some other dishes from some other countries in the region too.I recommend this restaurant for anyone who loves food in general. I have eaten at a handful of Malaysian restaurants in NYC and Philadelphia, as well as the suburbs of Chicago, and I think this place takes the cake out of any I&#39;ve tried (including Nyonya in Manhattan).",262,5,3,5,72,12.974299999999998,6.7829999999999995,0.33999999999999997,19.878,No

I can eat a bowl of rice with that sauce alone.-Chicken satay: I normally never order satay, but someone recommended it to us and it did not disappoint. Juicy and full of awesome char flavor.-Beef rendang: We chose to order it with the special rice option. The rice stole the show. You mix it up the coconut rice with a fried egg and other toppings. It was so flavorful and full of textures. The beef itself was so tiny. It had like 4 pieces total, but very delicious. Had awesome lemongrass flavors and tender. I think maybe if you don&#39;t order with the rice, it will come with more beef?? -Chicken Rice: A MUST get. The star of the entire meal. Huge portion and SUPER tender. The skin was so delicious. A big plate of chicken. Comes with a bowl of the most amazing rice and chili sauce. The rice was so flavorful, we had to order a second bowl. My favorite from tonight&#39;s meal.-Vegetable curry pot: This was okay. Not amazing, but not bad either. Nothing special.-Laksa: Loaded bowl of noodles. I loved the flavor and ingredients, but it was luke warm. We mentioned it to the owner(?) and he took note of it. Service was great. Super friendly and not pretentious. Sing (whom I think is the owner) was very informational and gave us recommendations, explanation of dishes, etc. One of the friends that we were dining with is actually Malaysian and he liked the food so that&#39;s a good sign.

It took 25 minutes for someone to take our order after we were seated and another 40 minutes for food to arrive. The staple Malaysian dish Nasi Lemak was not very well done, as it came with a fried egg that was cold. One of us got lamb with it, which was decent. Another one of us got beef and it was near inedible due to the cloyingly sweet lemongrass and hard texture. Singapore noodles were so-so.

I live in the loop and don&#39;t have a car, so the option of going to the Penang restaurant in the suburbs was just about impossible. For those of you who aren&#39;t familiar with Malaysia, we&#39;re like one of the foodiest nations in South East Asia. Probably on par with Singapore lol.

Curry laksa was nice and creamy and the Char Kuay Teow was easily a winner. It&#39;d hard to go wrong with that dish. They even brought you Sambal if you wanted it upon request. For those who don&#39;t know, Sambal is a spicy chili mixture of fresh chili peppers, garlic, ginger, shallots, sugar, lime juice, shrimp paste, fish sauce and all that good stuff. Drinks: So we ordered &#39;Malaysian ice tea&#39; and I was curious to see what they meant by that. I was delighted to find that they meant Teh Tarik. I would have liked the sweetness to have been a little less, but that&#39;s how I feel about all restaurants so that might just be a personal thing. It would be nice if they offered different levels of sweetness for it though :). Overall if you want to try a new/adventurous cuisine or if you want a taste of home (assuming you are from Malaysia) this is a great place to go!

The food tasted great overall, with the Fried Rice, the Char Kway Teow, and the Kangkung Belachan being the champs. The portions were pretty big too with the exception of the Kway Teow, which was surprisingly rather small, especially because the other dishes were pretty huge in size.One suggestion: the price of the Kangkung. It&#39;s one of the most expensive dishes we ordered at $12.95 if I&#39;m not mistaken, which didn&#39;t really make sense to us because the other main dishes (Fried Rice, Fried Kway Teow), which had meat, seafood etc. were priced lower than the Kangkung. I think adjusting the price of the Kangkung would definitely boost its popularity.Overall, it&#39;s a nice addition in Chicago.

I came for Mother&#39;s Day and the food did not disappoint.We ordered:- Fried Calamari - Tasty, but nothing to write home about. Wouldn&#39;t order again.  I probably would go with a Roti Canai type appetizer next time.- Hainanese Chicken - Chicken with light soy sauce and delicious spicy/tangy red sauce was the bomb! Chicken rice was really fluffy, each grain of rice was separate and cooked to chewy perfection.  Loved this! Craved it for so long and now I can statisfy my cravings.- Kang Kung Belacan - Delicious! Shrimp paste on-choy was dynamite.  My husband loved this, and he&#39;s a picky eater.- Char Kuey Teow - The noodles were super fresh, chewy, and nicely seasoned, though this doesn&#39;t taste like the most traditional interpretation of this dish.  There were pieces of chinese sausage, calamari, and pork fat, which although was good, just wasn&#39;t what I was expecting.- Nasi Lemak Beef Rendang - This was by far the best dish that I had.  The flavors were nicely developed in the beef, the coconut rice was rich and heavenly, and the accoutrements were perfectly balanced.  I especially enjoyed the pickled cabbage, which helped cut the heaviness of the beef and rice.  My son loved the shrimp chip, of course!

Yes, we have all heard the phrase, &#34;Don&#39;t judge a book by its cover&#34;. But at sometimes, it would be helpful to judge. I stated &#34;Why not give this a try!&#34; And I walked into the door. Around I saw a family with a disgusted face, and the food was pretty much untouched. Now, this gave me a very weird feeling about the food.  I walked up to the counter, and there was a woman who had no intention on saying &#34;Hi!&#34; Or &#34;Hello!&#34; I went on ordering some food. I ordered a &#34;Ribeye with pita, yellow rice, hummus, and some water&#34;. The prices where very high! 38 dollars for a plater seems intereasting and overpriced. So I expected the best! (Ofcourse, who woulden&#39;t?) Now, ten minutes pass by, and I look over the counter. The cook comes up and says what Ive ordered, but I had no idea I was suppose to get the food! Self service, overpriced food? Not worth it. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve ordered? Overpriced food with a small amount? Ok, Yes I have calmed my self down, and I got up to get the food. A guest getting the food, overpriced food? Hm, sad. Taking a bite of the food was unfortinatly tasteless. The food was not excuisite as I thought it was, mabey what others have thought.  I finally finish eating the horried food! Very unfortinate taste. I regreted paying that cash.

I didn&#39;t think the food was  very good, and the pricing on my veggie platter + cup of soup topped out at a little over $17.  For $5 less, I can get the same quantity of food that has a lot more flavor and includes a fountain drink at Naf Naf.  The food itself was fresh, but the falafel was on the dry side, and overall, everything (except the dipping sauce that came with the complimentary Zachi chips I got for checking in on Yelp) was lacking in flavor.  The hummus, baba ghanouj, falafel, salad, and lentil soup I make at home are all tastier.  I think the grub at Zachi could be really good.. if they seasoned things more assertively.  At any rate, my meal was fine.  I&#39;d come back if someone else suggested it, but I&#39;m in no hurry to go back of my own volition.",148,3,2,3,18,2.5964000000000005,1.2750000000000001,0.29900000000000004,10.426,No

A reason I had been reluctant to do so was the fear of having Zachi overrun by legions of the shawarma-starved.First, Zachi has been for years an awesome place for Middle Eastern fare. The wonderful staff has been serving a consistently delicious and hearty menu, never failing to provide us diners with a case of happy-belly.Greeted with a warm salutation and a sample of their splendid lentil soup, customers will do well in  trying their sandwiches/bowls/plates in any combo with their satisfying sides. Do not worry if you cannot sample everything on the menu in one wonderful meal. That is what return visits are for.",71,5,2,3,39,2.9203,1.5290000000000001,0.243,5.228,No

The falafel sandwich is so so good- super flavorful with the pickled veggies and yogurt sauce, and ask for hot sauce too to take it up a notch.

And honestly, this place lived up to the hype.The Good:  The falafel sandwich was really good. The beef shawerma was quite delectable as well. However, the chicken shawerma was just ok.The Bad: The Zachi chips were the probably the most uninspiring thing I have ever eaten. But then again, I got them for free for checking in on Yelp. So ultimately, I was just happy that I didn&#39;t waste money on them. The Ugly: I went here with a few friends, and although my order went smoothly, such was not the case for my friends. One of them wanted to make substitutions in his sandwich, but he wasn&#39;t allowed to do so - only deletions. However, the zinger was that the things he told them to not put in the sandwich were still put in it. Clearly, he wasn&#39;t happy with the service. Also, we went there at about 7:30 PM on a Friday night, but they were already out of certain items on the menu (the sandwich bites in particular). Clearly, this place was not perfect and has some issues it needs to address, however one thing is undeniable: many things on the menu are indeed quite tasty - or as they say, zachi.",131,4,2,4,14,3.6681999999999997,2.7050000000000005,0.618,9.677000000000001,No

Even though we ordered the shawarma plates which means for 3 extra bucks $9 total you also get a rice and a small side it was not a lot of food. For sides we had the hummus, baba and Jerusalem salad they where ok but a little bland for my taste. None of them where bad just did not pack a lot of flavor in my opinion. We also had a side of the falafel those where pretty tasty, moist inside crispy on the outside just like I like them, good stuff.I order the 3 pieces of pita side which cost $1 but somehow when I got home I saw I had 6 orders which means 18 pieces of pita. Not sure if they come with other stuff and that is why I was given a years supply of pita but lets just say everything at my house was served on pita for a while. I&#39;m pretty sure I was not charged for 6 orders but If they do come with the other dishes would be nice to be told so I don&#39;t over order.My total bill was about $30 which included 2 shawarma plates, a side of large hummus, side of falafel and 1 order of the 3 extra pc of pita. Overall the food was pretty good but seems like a lot of coin for not that much tabouli and to be honest when I think of this kind of food I think less expensive. I will definitely go back and do the lunch special get us 2 sandwiches with the hummus add a side of falafel and a side of pita (unless they are included),  cost 17 bucks now that&#39;s not much coin for a lot of tabouli.",170,3,2,2,36,1.6042,1.9729999999999999,0.867,9.161000000000001,No

As of this review, this place has an average of 4 1/2 stars on Yelp.  I&#39;ve been here twice and I&#39;ve left unsatisfied both times wondering how this place has such great reviews. The portions are very small and the prices are high for the amount of food you are given.  On my most recent trip, I ordered a Chicken Kabob Zachi Bowl.  The man behind the cashier (who looked completely miserable to be there) informed me that the Bowls were a new item so I figured I would try it.  When I received it I thought I was given the wrong dish.  All of the ingredients were placed on top of a large, laid out piece of Pita.  If I picked up the Pita and wrapped it up it would basically be a Sandwich, but no, this place likes to call such a thing a &#34;Bowl&#34;.Anyway, it looked terrible.  Drenched with Tahini Sauce, all of the rice on the bottom was just not edible.  There was half of a slice of a tomato in the whole bowl and 3 chunks of Chicken Kabob.  I couldn&#39;t believe that I just paid $9.99 for this pathetic excuse for a Mediterranean &#34;Bowl&#34;.  The man working there didn&#39;t even ask me how the food was because he knew it was complete sh*t.  Just do this place a favor and don&#39;t come here so it can be put out of its misery and close down. If you are in the mood for Mediterranean food and you&#39;re on Yelp searching for places to eat, just pick another high rated Mediterranean restaurant.

Reasonable portions, an understanding that sauces need not overtake the meal, and taste combinations that my tongue just frankly wasn&#39;t used to.Whereas Native Foods tries to mimic non-vegan flavorings, B&#39;Gabs treads its own path. Right, an analogy.

The ocean roll was the best of the 3 rolls and we ordered another along with the white tiger roll - the latter was ok and not as good as our second ocean roll.The service was far from hospitable as various staff rushed us to leave.

A friend of mine and I had dinner on the patio last night.  We were seated and immediately brought a small cucumber salad while we looked over the menu.  We started with edamame (for some reason I MUST have edamame to munch on when I go out for sushi); I would&#39;ve put a little more salt on it, but I&#39;m a salt person.Now for the rolls- we shared the White Tiger, West Town, and Dragon.  All three were delicious, and very fresh.  I was a little thrown off by the pink color of the soy paper wrap on the West Town, but everything tasted great.  We ordered two rolls first, and then added a third later.  It wasn&#39;t a problem at all for us to relax and take our time in between orders.  Don&#39;t you just love not being rushed when you&#39;re enjoying a good meal?Service- our waitress was very friendly, attentive to our water glasses, and chatted casually with us at the end of our meal.

The food was excellent - I had the tuna and smoke salmon sushi - so fresh and good.  I also tried two different rolls - the first visit was the Hamachi roll - which was just ok - I expected more flavor.  Last night I tried the Chicago Fire - I really liked that.  The servers are very sweet - the service is a little slow - but they are making everything to order.  This place does lose a star because there was a yelp check in offer for 50% off of any special roll - I had not planned on even getting a roll last night - but I did thinking about the special - when I turned it in the manager (?) came out and said that was from LAST summer - and yelp had not taken it down and he could not honor it ...I thought that was odd - a year old offer?  He could have at least offered something for the what I would consider false adverting.  It will not stop me from going back because it is a cute place - inside is small / outdoor is nice - its BYOB and the sushi is very good.,109,4,1,3,-20,2.2184,1.3659999999999999,0.46599999999999997,7.168,No

Their fish and rice are fresh, with perfect consistency, and their combinations of ingredients really bring everything together. On busy nights, get there early to avoid long waits, but if you get caught up in traffic their sushi really is worth the wait. I&#39;ve tried at least half of their diverse (yet not overwhelming) selection of specialty rolls, so I can confidently vouch for their deliciousness and value. I have since decided to stop supporting the meat and fish industry, but their vegetarian rolls are certainly up to par with the rest of the menu. The shitaki special is a favorite among my omnivore friends, and despite it being their only specialty vegetarian roll, I&#39;ll gladly come again and again for this roll. The shitaki and another one of their basic vegetable rolls fill me up quite nicely (I&#39;m 6&#39; and have a decent appetite).

Their space occupied the El side half of Stan&#39;s Donuts on Damen. I had never tasted blood orange juice before, and it was sure sweet. Probably even sweeter, feeling like I was in on the secret.It didn&#39;t seem too much longer after that that they opened their location on Milwaukee Avenue that must have been four or five times as large. I shook my head, thinking that the surefire way for your restaurant to fail is to expand too quickly. It got so popular that I didn&#39;t go there too often anymore.Sunday I Divvied by the South Loop location around 1 pm and I only saw a few people milling about outside so I decided that it was time to try it once again. The price of the coffee is highway robbery now ($3.50), though they&#39;ll give you a mug while you&#39;re waiting and refills like any respectable breakfast place and the coffee is still good. The menu hasn&#39;t changed too much, though the breakfast burrito is still as tasty as it ever was, and that was a time where breakfast burritos were still a relatively new thing. The one mistake I made was visiting the place alone. In the past, I&#39;ve always tried to visit with someone who is willing to equally share two dishes: one savory and one sweet. (Not one of you people who only will give a taste and call it &#34;sharing,&#34; and you know who you are!)

The omelet was alright but the steak was definitely on the tougher side. The pancakes were the highlight of the meal. My friend had the blueberry ones and she loved it! My boyfriend and I shared the red velvet - also pretty good. Only complaint about the pancakes is that the bottom was  a bit touch and chewy, but the cream cheese topping they put on top was the perfect balance to the sweet velvet pancakes. I would definitely try and come back for their brunch offering but the regular breakfast menu was nothing spectacular.",93,3,2,4,14,3.4633,2.0709999999999997,0.25,8.677999999999999,No

Lots of veggies, not enough sauce, and my croissant seemed to be a tad bit stale (it was pretty difficult to bite into). I would have liked if some of the greens were cooked because the entire sandwich was pretty much just a bunch of raw vegetables slapped onto a croissant with an egg. I suppose that I got what was written on the menu, I just think execution could have been better. Also, I asked for a poached egg and they told me it would take 25 minutes.... (25 minutes to poach an egg?! Seemed to me like they just didn&#39;t want to make me one :( )My friend got the breakfast burrito. She said it was plain but okay. Neither of us finished our meals but didn&#39;t ask for to go boxes. Overall I give this place a 3/5 because it wasn&#39;t bad. The wait staff was friendly.

Unfortunately, the next time I&#39;m craving sugary goodness for brunch, I&#39;m going to have to make the trek to Wicker Park because this South Loop location is disappointing. Strike 1: There is barely any signage for the restaurant. When I saw that there were what looked like janky home-printed signs reading &#34;The Bongo Room&#34; in the windows, I assumed they must have just opened a few months ago. Not so. This location has been open for years. What gives? Super unappealing and unprofessional. Strike 2: We put in our name and the wait was 45 minutes. No biggie. It was a Sunday at 11 AM and we were certainly prepared for a wait. They told us to check in again after 30 minutes in case people dropped from the list. We came back after 30 and were told it would be another 15 minutes. That was our original quote, so still no biggie. However, when we came back after waiting a total of 45 minutes the table was STILL not ready. We ended up having to wait another additional 10 minutes in the sun. They should have overquoted instead of underquoted for time. Or, perhaps a texting system like many other restaurants with long waits would have been appropriate. Strike 3: My girlfriend is a food blogger so a major consideration when brunching is access to natural light. Usually we&#39;re able to request seating by a window or she can move to take a picture in good light before eating. There was none here because all of the blinds were drawn. But the lack of natural light thing is not even a strike. Even though it was a beautiful day outside, it was dark and HOT inside. There was no air conditioning on for some godforsaken reason. It was also super cramped with tables pushed as closely together as possible. With the heat, it was bad. You&#39;re out: Our waitress was unattentive, offering us the BARE minimum. She stopped by to take orders, bring out our food, and the check. She never dropped by asking if we needed anything. Our waters were never refilled (bad because it was hot). To make matters worse, the chocolate french toast &#34;tower&#34; was extremely disappointing and looked nothing like any of the pictures of the dish on Yelp.

This was hands down my favorite breakfast during the trip and a wonderful start to my day.The Bongo Room is a breakfast joint and bruncherie with a few locations scattered around Chicago. Their menu is rather limited. However, TBR compensates for this scarcity of menu options by offering well-made breakfast staples featuring their own little twists. This is especially evident in the seasonally-changing pancake and french toast menu. Customers will occasionally encounter interesting creations such as heath bar pancakes and cranberry/orange pancakes with vanilla cream and crumbled gingersnaps. I personally prefer my breakfasts savory rather than sweet. I initially wanted some sort of benedict. Much to my dismay, TBR only offers that during weekends. I ended up with the vegetarian croissant sandwich and some cheesy house potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-bongo-room-chicago-3?select=akckc1y0Qu78KHHOQyPMzA) The sandwich was super delicious! They split a toasted croissant and crammed it with sprouts, tomatoes, spinach, cheese, and a fried egg. The cheese is typically melted muenster but they gladly substituted goat cheese upon my request. I loved the contrasting textures and the taste was also very good. The only real drawback for me was that the sandwich was on the messier side. As for those herbed house potatoes, I loved them. The white cheddar cheese was a nice touch as well. My two friends ordered pancakes and liked their orders to a degree. I tried a few bites.

Two eggs, toast, potatoes, and coffee make me the happiest person ever. That or a breakfast sandwich, which is essentially half of those items put together to make a heavenly sandwich.So, to be recommended to this little, very non-descript breakfast spot, I didn&#39;t know what I had in store. We arrived 10 minutes before it opened and we were third in line. I knew from that moment on, we were probably in for a treat. As soon as it opened the servers and busers were lined up to take each party back to the dining area. Again, if you were to look at this place, you may think it was a generic cafeteria. Everything is made with the bright, light colored wood (think IKEA), concrete walls, with splashed of blue and green. I wasn&#39;t judging this book, by its cover...I was just taking it all in.The menu isn&#39;t huge, but now I know why it doesn&#39;t have to be. I, as usual, went for the Croissant Sandwich. It is always what I&#39;ll go with when I want to be a little more adventurous for breakfast. J loves sweet for breakfast, but he wasn&#39;t too sure about pretzels in his pancakes. But after speaking with our server, she assured him this  decision was what many others make on a daily basis.I don&#39;t do sweets for breakfast, but I probably stole more than my fair share of his White Chocolate &amp; Carmel Pretzel Pancakes that morning. Event typing the name I feel like I&#39;ll get a cavity. However, by some magical stroke of genius  they&#39;ve created a pancake that isn&#39;t overly sweet, with just the right amount of sweetness and fluff! Seriously, these pancakes look like they are dripping in sugar, but once you take a bite, you are transcended into whatever pancakes in Heaven should taste like. The blend of the white chocolate and caramel, combined with the fluffy (not too dense) pancake, sprinkled with bits of pretzel is something that I can&#39;t even begin to describe.I also shouldn&#39;t forget to talk about my actual breakfast, not go on an done about the one I kept stealing. The croissant was amazing, buttery and flakey, just how I love them. I opted for egg whites and they were not shy with their portions. I did not like the potatoes, they were too &#39;wet&#39; for my liking, but had great seasoning and flavors. If they were crispy, they would have been the equivalent to breakfast crack! Sadly, I left most of them on my plate.Both breakfast portions were huge, sadly we couldn&#39;t finish either of them to their entirety. We both also ordered the Intelligentsia coffee, which we was also recommended to us by the same person. We enjoyed way too many cups of this caffeinated goodness, they even provided soy milk at no cost (follow suit CA)! It was basically packed since opening, but they have so many people working your coffee cup never gets empty, your food comes out fast, and their kitchen is killing it back there. It is a well oiled machine, that not only knows how to manage the breakfast rush, but their dishes already speak for themselves. After 30 years, I finally truly appreciate the pancake after coming here...",360,5,2,5,46,8.016100000000002,4.8260000000000005,1.5080000000000002,26.667,No

Nobody was able to have more than a bite or 2. But they were good.Normal Croissant Sandwich &amp; Breakfast Potatoes- Was devoured and a fan favorite.

Everywhere I go for brunch, I thrive on benedicts, omelettes, quiche, fried chicken, etc. I&#39;ve been known to eat hamburgers for breakfast but I stay the heck away from pancakes and waffles because when I wake up, I do not want gallons of sugar going down my throat.The Bongo Room is the only place I have ever broken this rule and dang, it was 100% worth it. We arrived on a Saturday morning to a 45 minute wait - not bad.  The coffee bar in the waiting area is great not only because it gives you something to do, but also because when you&#39;re 40 people crowded into a restaurant waiting area on a hot summer day, they give you endless water, which is much appreciated.The restaurant itself has a lovely, clear, sunny atmosphere. We sat a table in the middle (which I usually don&#39;t like) and were treated to endless amounts of gorgeous sunlight. Our waitress was friendly, polite, and fast-moving. We were never a table that had been left hanging. I broke my sugar-for-breakfast rule for the strawberry-banana-passionfruit pancakes. Oh my God, these were everything I could have asked for and more. They were so FRUITY. I refused to add any syrup because the tart-sweet-creaminess of the passionfruit mousse was the most amazing topping for the pancakes. I wanted to lick it off the plate. The strawberries and bananas were plentiful (though I wished they were in the pancakes themselves - a banana pancake topped with strawberries and this passionfruit JOY mousse is the only way I could see to make this dish even better). As a result, I ended up with an amazing, tropical, sweet-tart, light and fluffy pancake dish that I wish I could eat daily.My friend got the vegetarian croissant sandwich and an iced coffee -- both were also great The croissant sandwich was packed with fillings and very flavorful. The coffee was excellent. Altogether, a great brunch experience. PS - they don&#39;t do takeout on the weekends, which is a bummer.",224,4,2,5,20,6.310200000000001,3.9480000000000004,0.9309999999999998,16.121,No

Quite a long time, but at least I was engaged in entertaining conversation.After my friend and I sat down, the server at the table next to us, proceeded to back up and spill a LOT of water all over my side of the table, my coat (which was on my lap), me, and the floor. (I was happy she hadn&#39;t spilled a pot of coffee on me.) Lots of mopping ensued, as did an apology, while I remained extremely calm. It would&#39;ve been appropriate for our server / the restaurant to offer me a free breakfast or SOMETHING out of that mess -- that water had gone everywhere -- but no one ever did. My small strawberry lemonade was $4.50 and no refills? The waiter, a seemingly nice guy, just laid our bill on the table without asking us if we wanted anything else. And the food was just okay.

My sister told me that I was not allowed to return to New York until I tried this place out. I wanted to go to the original Wicker Park location, but it was a little out of the reach for me so I went to the Southside location. As busy as it was, we only waited about 20 minutes to get a table for 2. Chicago portion size is ginormous! I did not see one person leave without a take-out box. We were smart about it and the waitress allowed us to order single pancakes so we can try multiple flavors (which is not advertised on the menu directly). It&#39;s a little more expensive but way worth it for foodies like me. For this place, I say stick to the pancakes. They were the fluffiest pancakes I have ever eaten. I love this place so much that I came back twice during my vacation. I used to think Clinton Street Baking Company in New York was the best pancakes I ever had, but this place blows them out of the water.1 - The pineapple jack pancakes with vanilla bean cream was our personal favorite. It looks plain in pictures, but I guarantee this was the best thing invented by mankind. 2 - The strawberry banana pancakes with passionfruit cream was another favorite (especially the cream), but I felt the flavoring of the strawberries overpowered the dish. 3 - White chocolate with berry dressing french toast special was another good option. It was very pretty to look at and the size was again, huge! I was afraid that it was going to be too sweet for me, but surprisingly it was not. I wished they cut the bread into smaller slices so the batter would cover the entire inside of the bread or if they dipped the bread into the batter a little bit longer so it wouldn&#39;t be as dry inside. FYI: another option where you can order just a single slice of toast instead of the full size. 4 - The Veggie Croissant was also great option considering that we didn&#39;t eat much veggies on this trip. It had the most buttery croissant I have ever tasted (very french style...which I enjoyed) filled with melted muenster cheese, baby spinach, tomato slices, saut’©ed mushroom, cucumber, alfalfa sprouts &amp; scallions topped with an egg with basil mayo served with house potatoes. This place really lives up to the thousand reviews!

The al dente fusilli was topped with three delicious sausages, three giant meatballs, and a giant pork shank.

After careful research (aka stalking my Yelp reviews and my Instagram food account) they picked Monteverde since there was no evidence I had eaten there yet. They knocked it out of the park! The food was top notch and the ambiance and service was stellar.We ended up at the chef&#39;s table so had a front row seat to all the fun at the pass and several chats with Chef Sarah Grueneberg. She was so excited and it was clear from the beginning of our meal how proud she is, and rightfully so, of this little Italian outpost she&#39;s built in the West Loop.The place was packed but not crowded, it that makes sense. Not an empty table in the house and the earliest reservation we could get was 845pm.The one downside of the seat we had was the massive case of FOMO we developed watching the pork shank dish leaving the kitchen!!! That massive shared platter for the table looked and smelled delicious but we opted for a sampling of smaller plates. We had octopus, broccoli, the Arrabiatta (which are amazing server Rose warned us was a 6 out of 10 in the spicy scale and she wasn&#39;t lying), sea scallops, and spaghetti alla Chitarra.The spaghetti was my favorite dish of the night, probably because I am a sucker for shaved truffle over a simple pasta dish and this delivered, generously!  I also love that the serving of spaghetti was bulked up with strands of zucchini mixed in with the pasta.On top of the gorgeously plated and out of this world tasting ice cream birthday cake I got, we tried the new addition to the dessert menu, vanilla bean Panna cotta with blueberry sorbet. My picture doesn&#39;t to justice to the vibrant color of the sorbet that was smooth and packed with blueberry flavor. It was not overly sweet and featured an expertly done crumble to add a nice textural contrast.Beginning to end, fantastic dinner.

We started off with 2 glasses of wine and nibbled on their addictive breadsticks.The Nduja arancini that arrived were so crispy I had to fork them gingerly to prevent them from flying off to the next table, which I&#39;m glad none did because they were too good to share! Underneath the crispy exterior we found gooey, cheesy risotto with a slight kick from the Nduja. Heavenly. Then the grilled artichoke bruschetta came with a delicate slice of black truffle perched on each slice of bread. Who knew artichoke went so well with truffle? And the bread...O.M.G.Having read rave reviews about her homemade pasta, we ordered two, the arrabbiata &amp; tortelli verdi. The arrabbiata packs a punch with its shrimp-head essence, and the shrimps were super fresh, the pasta  perfectly al dente. Too bad it was also ridiculously salty. It&#39;s sad to see such a simple mistake ruin an otherwise perfect dish. The tortelli verdi was much better, the flavors so bright and sweet it&#39;s like an Italian summer in a plate.We ended with butterscotch budino and black forest ice cream cake.

If service was given to us similarly to the later tables, I may bump this up cause there are some good food coming out of the kitchen.When you first arrive, you notice the restaurant immediately... it&#39;s bright, airy, and this is the inside ... not talking about the patio area! I love the bar area with it&#39;s dedicated pasta station in full view and display.  Honestly... very well designed and eye catching.  The tables are nicely spread out too... not too congested.  We were there on a Tuesday evening and though the restaurant was about 80% full... I didnt have to yell to have a great conversation.  That is a HUGE plus compared to other new restaurants.  The service is where we had the greatest challenge to love this restaurant... we interacted with 3 different people.  There was the hostess, server, and wait staff (bus boy). Two of the three was disappointing and honestly... surprisingly poor for such a restaurant as this.  The wait staff (bus boy) honestly worked so god damn hard... hardest working person we saw in a restaurant in the entire week of dining.  He was on point for clearing dishes, providing water and he managed a large section.  Anyhow, the hostess was not very nice... as she moved people to the tables, she returned to the hostess stand and made comments about every table she sat down to the servers that were beside her.  It made it uncomfortable as you wonder, what the hell is she going to say about us?  It wasn&#39;t that she was in a bad mood but she clearly was having a great time mocking all the patrons.  Also, it didnt help the servers were in on it.  Our server was not attentive.... and this showed up more strikingly as the night went on.  In addition to leaving us alone for great periods of time, he also gave short quips when we had questions, and showed a lack of interest to our table... on top of that, our plates never cleared once between the different saucy dishes ... though the tables that arrived later in the night got clean plates after each dish and a completely different happy and personable waiter.  It was just disappointing to see how were not treated at all the same.  As for the meal, there were some great things... the octopus was definitely a highlight, the arrabiata was great with a well cooked shrimp and spicy but still flavourful sauce, and the ragu was very good. The tomato salad was a large impressive dish and we loved the creamy burrata.  The arancini was tasty but I think some of ours were fried too long in cold oil so it was not as crispy and it was more dense from absorbing oil, the mountain salad was good but I dont remember too much of it, and the chicken livers was an interesting app... the polenta had the right crunch but a bit bland, the livers were well cooked,... i think the sides to the livers were just not up to the same level.  We also had the eggplant parm (good), polenta from the gluten free menu (ok), and the tortelli verde (good but the arrabiata).   The desserts looked solid and we wanted to order them but at that point, I think we were just so disappointed with the service.  Nothing could really rescue the meal at that point.  And we were just ready to leave.Comparing it to the other new restaurants we visited in our business trip (Lena Brava, Pub Royale, and Revival), we were the most disappointed in this one... not because of the food but because of the service.

When we arrived, I was impressed by the light, airy decor.  They managed to make a relatively small space look a lot bigger and more open.  It took a minute for us to get seated only because they had to get a high chair, which I was thankful they even had.Our server was pretty reserved and matter of fact.  I was a little miffed that we had to ask for the bread after we ordered after seeing everyone around us get one. Baby girl really liked munching on those crispy thin bread sticks.  We decided to try a few small dishes and two pasta dishes.  One of the specials for the night was the fried zucchini flowers with corn.  It was good, but I was overwhelmed by the amount of cheese stuffed inside.  The Grilled Artichoke Crostini was pretty good, with a generous amount of truffle shavings on top.  Each piece was too big to just pick up and eat with grace since there was so much stuff on top.  The Octopus Spiedini was my least favorite dish.  It was too salty.  When we inquired if it was supposed to taste that salty, the server informed us that it was a marinade and not added salt so the chef would not be able to remake it any differently.  He also suggested our palate was too sensitive.  I personally like salt and prefer dishes on the salty side, so for me to say it was too salty is pretty significant.  At least he offered to take that dish off our bill after we declined a substitute.  The Cacio Whey Pepe was good, but not spectacular.  The Spaghetti Alla Chirtarra was flavorful but we were pretty full by that time.  We capped the evening with a Butterscotch Budino which was the right portion and not too sweet.I&#39;m glad we checked this place out and can cross it off my cacio e pepe Chicago bucket list.",203,3,2,5,32,5.628100000000001,2.979,0.404,18.617,No

Menu was small with few vegetarian options. We ordered the following: 1. Prosciutto butter toast: very buttery, tasted like prosciutto but no large pieces of meat. Only served 3 small slices for 2 people. Honestly ridiculous not to serve 4 slices so we did not have to cut and ruin the 3rd slice. Presentation was beautiful.2. Arugala salad: very good and different, felt almost like Indian spices with some spice and tangy flavors. Large yellow tomatoes were delicious. 3. Pumpkin Ravioli: very good, portion was appropriate4. Pork Chop: perfect...the potatoes were excellentService was excellent as well. Was very loud in the dining room even for 5:30-6pm so ended up shouting at my husband most of the night. Perhaps will go if/when they change the menu.",110,4,2,2,47,1.8688,2.357,0.766,8.877,No
monteverde-chicago,Jennie T.,EqZRpkpkWf54rwfnq5MUsw,LqvbgbQCTt0tEu_Uq_9arw,"I took Kenny O. here for his birthday, and I think our expectations for this place was placed too high. It was slightly disappointing. We started off with the proscuitto butter toast, which was great, but a bit too salty for the both of us. I enjoyed the crunch of the toast and the savory taste of the dish, but ultimately the saltiness of the dish won out. Then we had the blossom squash dish, which was my favorite appetizer. I love how lightly fried the blossoms were. The cheese inside was savory; the corn and peppers added a nice crunchiness to the dish.I did not enjoy the octopus spiedini at all. I usually like seafood and octopus, but it wasn&#39;t charred enough. Kenny thought it was cooked perfectly, but I thought it could use maybe a few more seconds of cooking. I didn&#39;t enjoy the salsa that came with it either. It was too tart and cold and didn&#39;t go well with the octopus. Kenny and I both thought we&#39;d like the cacio whey pepe the most because it had such great reviews on Yelp and elsewhere. Unfortunately, the saltiness of the dish was too overwhelming. Kenny enjoyed the al dente pasta, whereas I thought it could be cooked for a few seconds longer so that it&#39;s not as hard on the inside for me. The pepperiness of the dish was on point though.We enjoyed the spaghetti alla chitarra the most. Yes, there were anchovies in the pasta. It was fine, you didn&#39;t see any heads or fishy body parts, so for those of you who are scared seeing those things in your food, rest assure. The taste was exquisite. The pasta was cooked perfectly, the truffles were not overpowering, and you couldn&#39;t even really taste the fishiness of the anchovies. They tasted more like wood ear mushrooms to me. And unlike most of the other dishes we had that evening, it wasn&#39;t overly salty. We finished the evening with the roasted sea scallops, which were delicious and perfectly charred. Unfortunately I disliked the sauce that it came with. It had a strange bitterness to it, and I couldn&#39;t tell if it came from the olives or something else in the sauce. I did enjoy the peanuts that were in it though because it gave it a different texture and crunch to the dish.Overall, I thought Monteverde was okay. I might have liked it more if most of the dishes weren&#39;t so salty.

I liked that there were plenty of seafood options for people like me who doesn&#39;t care for pasta. I know. It&#39;s crazy. I thought the octopus appetizer was fantastic. It was so tender and well balanced in flavor. We had to order another one. Didn&#39;t care for the carpaccio. Too much citrus. Nearly ruined the whole thing.

monteverde-chicago,Ben B.,ZIlZhl7xT9gztKRlWk8Uvg,M1uAUMlViGJcoAfl3uhD5w,"Do you like seafood?  Maybe check it out.I don&#39;t like seafood.  I also don&#39;t like inattentive waiters.Then again, maybe it&#39;s better the waiter was inattentive.  Whenever he came over, the subtext of everything he said was, &#34;I hate my job.  Please get me fired.&#34;The cost of some of these dishes is completely out of whack with reality.The grilled artichoke crostini were pretty good, but not worth $16.  You get three of them, which is super-ideal for sharing with one other person.I also ordered the pasta arrabbiata ($16).  Did it need shrimp?  No.  I asked for them to remove that.  Could I substitute something for gross shrimp, like chicken?  The waiter looked at me like I just asked if I could take a giant dump in the middle of the restaurant.  Sorry, guy.  I guess just bring me regular arrabbiata.  What&#39;s that?  My arrabbiata is just 20 noodles?  Solid investment on my part!Monteverde is *extremely* loud.  All the surfaces are hard, so the noise bounces all over the place.  The tables are also incredibly close together.  Strangely, our waiter and bus-boy always approached the table in such a way they&#39;d have to reach the long way, right in front of us, to get the plates.  Had they approached from the other side (equidistant), it wouldn&#39;t have been so rude.Monteverde loves seafood so much, they throw it in dishes that don&#39;t even need it.  Why ruin perfectly good arancini by shoving tuna inside?  That&#39;s a food crime.I polished off my beer and would have ordered another, but the sullen server just brought us the check without asking.Anyway, you can get much larger portions of substantially better food at dozens of Italian restaurants across the city.

I read about this place in several articles of best new restaurants in Chicago and I had to check it out. The fresh pasta making and simple but authentic contemporary Italian dishes made it a must try. It was a little tough getting a reservation only a few days out on a Saturday night... Standard for any place... I managed to get in right when they opened. As we sat down the entire place filled up within the first 30 minutes and bar was completely full... That&#39;s a good sign. People must know how good this place is. The place is very charming and warm and inviting. Kind of a simple Italian kitchen feel. We were seated right away and had amazing cocktails within the first 3 minutes of us sitting down. Our server was rose and she was nothing short of amazing. She guided us through the menu and we tried a lot of pastas... Everything was outstanding. I can&#39;t even decide what is my favorite but they completely nailed all the dishes. This past summer I went to Italy and the food I had last night tasted pretty much the same as if I were back in Rome. I already want to go back! Also... The bussers were soooo good...

Then we migrated to the eggplant with an amazingly crispy and tasty skin.  Never had anything like it before.  We thought it would be the meal&#39;s highlight, but then they brought the pumpkin ravioli.  Unbelievable!  Truly unbelievable!  Creamy smooth, flavorful, but a very appealing mild pumpkin.

monteverde-chicago,William B.,hqojrGeufv6qYpN00R-OsA,zj758ecSpUgwg-gjQ_zr6w,"I know this has been hailed as the new temple of pasta, but I am tempted to give a five-star review solely on the basis of a non-pasta dish, the nduja arancini. This is one of those &#34;oh! now I get it!&#34; dishes. Until now I&#39;d never understood the point of an arancini. Sure, I like a fried ball of rice and cheese as much as the next guy, but they never seemed particularly special and I didn&#39;t understand what the rice was doing either. Now I get it. Once you add a gooey nduja mixture to the rice, the whole thing becomes a vessel for the deep, nutty sausage flavors, and the contrast of textures becomes sharper. They deserve a prize for this.The rest of the menu was good, but not as prize-winning. The artichoke crostini were good, but could have used -- dare I say it? -- more artichoke and less shaved truffle. The special pasta dish of pasta discs, potatoes, pesto, shrimp, and fennel fronds was good, but ultimately a little puzzling. (I never did understand what the potatoes were trying to accomplish.) A filled pasta dish from the &#34;tipica&#34; category was delicious. My complaints are minor, and in another city this would be a five-star review, but high-end Italian food is possibly the most competitive restaurant genre in Chicago. Monteverde is a worthy competitor, but doesn&#39;t blow away the race.Final honorable/dishonorable mentions. Honorable: unusually good cocktail list, with a &#34;green gimlet&#34; incorporating chartreuse and basil and a couple of nice summer spritzes. Dishonorable: distracted server, who helpfully insisted that we order our dishes one at a time over the night (apparently because the kitchen isn&#39;t organized to produce courses), but then made herself scarce at the several junctures where we might have wanted to order another dish, and opined on our ordering choices in a strange way.",222,4,2,3,36,2.9602999999999997,2.101,0.233,17.664999999999996,No

monteverde-chicago,Alex B.,5jbBEpPRPOpOMJe22BrZnA,YCb1QjwB6vk3CvxHvfVgbg,"Last night, my wife and a friend of ours dined at Monteverde.  The food was fantastic.  The atmosphere was great.  But the experience was AWFUL.  Here&#39;s the story:  We had a lovely meal.  We started by splitting two small plates.  We had some grilled octopus (Octopus Spiedini) and Burrata on a crunchy slice of bread with some pumpkin puree.  Both dishes were excellent.  I was raving about the food.  And the portions were so generous that it was almost a shame to call them &#34;small&#34; plates.  And for our entrees, we each got a pasta dish.  My wife and our friend each got pumpkin tortelloni.  Again, delicious.  It was sweet and rich and creamy.  It was an artfully crafted pasta dish.  And I got a simple pasta--tajarin with butter and parmesan cheese, with freshly shaved white truffles.  I always judge a pastaria by its simple preparations.  This one did not disappoint.  And Chef Sarah Grueneberg even came over and shaved the truffles herself.  She seemed really nice and it was a classy addition to the experience to have her come to our table.  For dessert we all split a butterscotch budino.  It was also outstanding.  The food was GREAT.  The atmosphere was a little loud but it hit that sweet spot of being high energy without becoming a cacophony of noise that is unconducive to conversation.   All signs were pointing to a glowing review.  Throughout the meal we had been enjoying our beverages.  My wife had a glass of brut ros’© champagne.  Our friend had a glass of Lambrusco with her meal and a glass of their house made limoncello with dessert.  I started with a glass of Bonarda and had the recommended wine pairing with my pasta:  Cantina del Pino.  Both of my wines were excellent and the recommended pairing was superb.  Again, everything is looking good.  With dessert, I had a digestif.  I ordered a Montenegro.  Our server explained that he liked Montenegro with a twist of orange.  I told him that sounded great.  I have had many Italian digestifs in my day, but I had never had Montenegro.  It was a delicious end to the meal.  It was cool and refreshing.  It was an excellent cap to what should have been a wonderful evening.  And then the check came.  The amount of the check was not a problem at all.  The problem was that they charged me two dollars for ice.  The last entry on the receipt was for &#34;Rocks, $2.00&#34;.  I didn&#39;t order my digestif on the rocks.  The server suggested that I have it with a twist.  But even if I did, it offends me terribly to charge me $2.00 for ice.  I had just spent $210 for what was a wonderful dinner and now you want to nickel and dime me for $2.00.  That seems disingenuous and disappointing.  I have recently been told that when I have a bad experience at a restaurant, rather than blasting the restaurant online, I should first give the restaurant a chance to make amends.  So I took that advice to heart and I pointed out my disappointment to our server.  I told him how much we enjoyed our meal, but how disappointed I was to see a charge for &#34;rocks&#34; on our bill.  He told me, and I kid you not, &#34;Well, that&#39;s what all the restaurants are doing these days.&#34;  When I pointed out to him that, no, in fact, that&#39;s not true, he said, &#34;Well, we put more alcohol in when we serve the drink on the rocks.&#34;  I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s true or not, but (a) it doesn&#39;t say that on the menu, (b) I didn&#39;t order my drink on the rocks, and (c) whatever happened to &#34;the customer is always right&#34;?  He could have easily said &#34;I&#39;ll take care of that for you&#34; and removed the $2.00 charge from our bill.  He should have said &#34;I&#39;m sorry for the confusion, let me take care of your drink (or dessert, or some other small part of our bill) for you.&#34;  If he had done either of those things, this review would be entirely different.  But he didn&#39;t and we all left disappointed.  The food was excellent.  The atmosphere was great.  And our experience wound up being AWFUL.  You can&#39;t charge people who are paying $200 for dinner $2.00 for ice.  That&#39;s just cold.  And when a customer complains about it, you can&#39;t just say &#34;Well, everybody else is doing it.&#34;  Everybody else is not doing it.   And anyone else that is doing it should stop.  If you charge me high prices for great food, I won&#39;t bat an eye.  But if you try to nickel and dime me and sneak some silly surcharges past me, I am going to be pissed.  And it&#39;s shame, because Monteverde could easily have become my new &#34;go-to&#34; restaurant in Chicago.  But I&#39;m just not interested in a fine dining establishment that&#39;s BYOI--Bring Your Own Ice.",499,1,2,5,14,9.629999999999997,12.292000000000003,4.373,53.336999999999996,No
monteverde-chicago,Anna G.,efRjnJidN1GM2ZBsSdtnNA,yg4V1INHHXh84W9dJUw4_A,"Great dinner experience at Monteverde! Made a reservations 3-4 weeks in advance and the first opening I could get was on a Tuesday evening and, let me tell you, the place as bustling. The crowd was varied between after work dinners, dates, girls&#39; dinners, etc. and it all contributed to a great atmosphere (though it wasn&#39;t too loud so no worries on that front). I really liked the d’©cor as it wasn&#39;t your typical Italian nor too trendy. Although my friend and I only tried a few items, we were impressed by what we had. Our server was also very helpful in describing the dishes and selecting wine. We split the prosciutto butter toast as an appetizer and it wasn&#39;t what I expected, but I really liked it. It comes with 3 pieces so if you have a table of more people than that, you&#39;ll have to split or order more. I honestly would have been happy enough with a buttered baguette with a slice of prosciutto on top, but the spread the toast was topped with was delicious. For our mains, we ordered the gnocchetti sardi and cannelloni saltimbocca. The former sounds like it might be bland or boring, but the flavors were great and the ricotta was so fresh. The latter was not a typical overflowing pasta dish, but rather rolls of pasta stuffed with prosciutto and lamb. My friend was a big fan. We were both also pleasantly surprised by the pricing. The 3 dishes and a glass of wine came out to only around $50. Based on the hype, location, chef, and freshness, we expected much higher prices. I can see why reservations are booked so far out.

monteverde-chicago,Matthew L.,bvx34eq9P9fEiQuWvLLLHA,uWYgL525ypbLtJ1en3wvwA,"I&#39;m scratching my head about this one. Usually, I can identify the things about a meal (or bar, or movie, or album, or really anything subjective...) that I liked and that I disliked. But despite the fact that I could not think of much about my meal at Monteverde that could have been improved,  I left feeling...disappointed? Disillusioned? Even a little depressed?Maybe my expectations were unattainable. Food writers and critics across the country have been hailing this restaurant as one of the best recent openings in Chicagoland and even nationwide. The concept-- upscale but affordable modern Italian-- is right in my wheelhouse.The ambiance is lacking for reasons I can actually articulate. As other Yelpers have pointed out, the place is trendy, it&#39;s modern, it&#39;s a little generic considering the standards restaurants like this are held to, and it&#39;s really, really loud. I can&#39;t remember if the floors were poured concrete in the Chipotle-chic industrial style, but that&#39;s the sort of vibe here (and it would help explain the place&#39;s acoustics). That is to say, the target audience of twentysomething West Loop yuppies will feel very comfortable here, but this is actually a problem: a restaurant with aspirations like Monteverde&#39;s should strive to be different, maybe a little uncomfortable.The menu is a tad confusing. It&#39;s not clear what&#39;s the difference between &#34;Pasta Tipica&#34; from Italy and &#34;Pasta Atipica&#34; from Chicago. Does that just mean the &#34;atipca&#34; dishes are less traditional, or does it mean that the &#34;atipica&#34; pastas are made in-house and the &#34;tipica&#34; ones are not? The prices for the main dishes seemed too low for full entrees but too high to be small plates. Luckily, the service was very good and our waitress recommended how much food to order.The food. Combining two difficult-to-pronounce Italian words that also happen to be current food trends, the nduja arancini (fried risotto balls seasoned with what is more or less salami paste) were excellent. Four golf ball sized fritters, piping hot, not greasy, and just on the verge of too salty but not quite over the edge. The seasonal special of fried squash blossoms, stuffed with ricottta, lemon, and truffle, was also fantastic. While the arancini were bold, the squash blossoms were delicate and subtle. I appreciated this: two bold appetizers would have overwhelmed the palate, while two delicate ones would have underwhelmed. And there&#39;s an impressive degree of versatility on display here.The entrees were indeed smallish, but given their sub-$20 prices, I actually think this is reasonable. The twin ravioli were delicious: fresh pasta with two separate pockets inside, one sweeter squash-based filling (I think), and one more savory filling that (again, if I remember correctly) was more like a lamb sausage. Very tasty, though maybe a tad gimmicky. Don&#39;t order the gnochetti, though. First of all, these sound like they&#39;ll be mini-gnocchi, but they&#39;re not. The dish is essentially mini shell pasta (which may have been made in-house, but didn&#39;t taste like it) with plain old tomato-basil sauce. Underwhelming.My Manhattan was just okay. I should have gotten red wine, but I didn&#39;t love the by-the-glass offerings. I left full, we didn&#39;t pay that much for what we got, and most everything was tasty, but, again, I wasn&#39;t thrilled when I left. Maybe I&#39;m spoiled.

This food was not the latter. I had the arancini and arrabiata and my mother had the egg ravioli.My problem was less with the food and more with the service, which was stunted, and the meal took far longer than it should have. The kicker: my mom and I both ordered the same dessert at the end of the meal. The waitress acknowledged our order, then dropped off the check. After sitting and waiting for 15 minutes we looked at the check to find that she had not charged us for either dessert.

monteverde-chicago,Ashley C.,98DslWquC6ypAJZyZcKcZg,_e9zV-xXiBUhnTM0mUIqOg,"We made a reservation for a weeknight dinner a few weeks in advance given that it is very difficult to come by a reservation especially at peak times. Good news is the bar is first come first serve.It is not a very big restaurant.  We were seated at a high top towards the back and by the bar.  From our table, you could see the pasta-making podium which has a mirror at the top so you can really watch.  I also loved watching all the dishes walk by to get a preview of the menu. The tables can be a bit close together and it can get loud.  The cocktails were solid, but Monteverde&#39;s wine list and selection shine.  To start, I had their version of the moscow mule which was good. I eventually split some white wine which was yummy and paired well with the food. The red wine I tasted was also very good. I thought their wine prices were very reasonable for a restaurant and they had good selections at various price points.The food was excellent.  To start, we shared the hamachi crudo, artichoke &amp; sunchoke crostini, the octopus and the proscuitto butter toast.  I really liked the crostini and the octopus.  I would pass on the proscuitto butter toast next time.  Never would I thought I would say this, but there was too much butter.  I found that the butter overpowered the other ingredients.  For the main, I ordered the Rabbit Ragu.  The rabbit was cooked perfectly and so tender.  Also, our table mostly shared the Ragu Alla Napoletana which comes with meatballs, sausage and a huge pork shank in a red sauce.  It was delicious and the shank was so tender that it just flaked off the bone.  It is huge so I recommend having 3+ people in on that dish. Service was pretty good. Our waiter was friendly, but he seemed rushed throughout the meal and then occasionally was hard to find. I am a big fan of Top Chef and thought it was really neat that Sarah was in the kitchen and serving some of the dishes. Overall, it was a wonderful tasty meal and certainly has the potential to be bumped to 5 stars.",225,4,3,5,65,9.4227,5.364,0.16899999999999998,21.466999999999995,No

We went for two reasons: 1. We are Top Chef fans, and we really enjoyed watching Sarah. 2. We are suckers for homemade pasta.Monteverde did not disappoint! When we arrived, we were greeted and seated immediately. The place has a little bit of a hipper, downtown vibe than I anticipated, which was nice. There&#39;s a large bar in the center, communal seating on one side, and high-top tables on the other. It was bustling and lively. We sat at the high-tops, which you could also refer to as Date Night Corner.The service was attentive and genuine. We got breadsticks and water immediately, and the waiter explained the menu as being mostly shareable plates--like every other restaurant in Chicago. :)Our order was maybe a bit too ambitious for just the two of us, but that&#39;s how we roll. The lineup:octopus with Japanese sweet potato and leeks: goodn&#39;duja arrancini: GREAT--like fried pepperoni ballstortellini in brodo--need a little salt, for my taste, but the broth was SO rich and heartycrostini with sunchokes and artichokes--GREAT tagliatelle with mushrooms, lamb sausage, and black truffles--generous with the truffles, delicious, great bite to the pastaarriabiata with shrimp--maybe the best of the night, a must-try, as others have saidcookie sundae with milk and honey ice cream--deliciouschocolate tart with kumquats and marshmallows--fantasticThere wasn&#39;t a dish we didn&#39;t like, and we finished everything except for the arriabiata--only because we&#39;d over-ordered and wanted to save room for dessert. Don&#39;t worry, that will be my lunch, tomorrow.I&#39;d like to go back with a bigger group. For like $38, they have a family-style Sunday sauce with a whole pork shank, sausage, and meatballs.

Both the food and service were average at best. The only redeeming quality is that the interior design and ambiance/vibe are quite good.Overall, we expected more based on the price point and other reviews.

She was very grateful that we came to the restaurant and was happy to take a picture with our group of 6. Right in the middle of all the wonderful restaurants in West Loop, Monterverde had a full house. Our waiter went over the menu explaining everything and even suggesting how many dishes we should possibly get- being honest about which ones are heavier if we are sharing. We got a total of about 10 dishes and here is my favorite to least favorite: Fav: Artichoke Crostino: If you love artichoke, you will love it more after having this dish. It&#39;s simple- but the way the artichoke is prepared is absolutely perfect with the crunchy yet soft crostini. It&#39;s a great way to treat your palette and start your dining experience. Fav: Njudo (Rice Fritters): I get it- Rice Fritters- you wouldn&#39;t think? But it was phenomenal. I had just a little bit because we were sharing- and I wish I had the whole dish to myself. The poached tuna is incredible. Not my favorites- but you should still try are the pastas. I would start with one to two because they are heavy. The pasta is thick and if you are not a huge black pepper person- make sure you mention that because it&#39;s overwhelming. We tried many of the pasta&#39;s listed but my favorite was the Duck Egg Corzetti. The duck is more diced than minced but it has a strong and rich flavor with the olives and pecan pesto. After the appetizers, and pasta, I was full. We also ordered the Ragu Alla Napoletana for the table. And here&#39;s the thing- that is the best presentation you can find at an Italian restaurant and I feel that&#39;s what separates Monterverde from other Italian Restaurants. If you are  meat person or come with a group- consider this but don&#39;t feel bad if you don&#39;t finish it. It&#39;s HUGE. We passed on dessert- but the wine list was incredible and overall a good experience. Wouldn&#39;t mind coming back for appetizers and more cocktails. Try the &#39;Saba soda!&#39; if you are going non-alcoholic. If you ask how it&#39;s prepared- its amazing - and then that&#39;s only 5 bucks.",231,4,2,5,49,10.3294,4.776,0.307,20.918,No

Unfortunately we were sitting next to the window and it was freezing, had the pretty yet very thin curtains closed and still had my coat across my lap... It&#39;s Chicago- heavy drapes and thick glass are important!Moving on to the service... Waitress was super scattered and hard to track down, not to mention after we ordered, one of my dinner companions mentioned that she really doesn&#39;t like seafood and wanted to confirm there wasn&#39;t any in the dishes we ordered.  The waitress asked if there were any allergies and my friend said no, but that she really didn&#39;t like seafood- to which the waitress said there was none in the dishes we ordered ... ( you know where this is going right?) so the first dish arrives in a smear of tuna... To be fair, the tuna was noted on the menu, but we had already passed the menus back to the waitress...On to the main event... Picking up with the tuna smear, it was the bed for the arancini that was decent, nice crunchy coating and creamy inside, but the flavors were a little one note.  Next came the chicken liver which was on a delicious bed of polenta, but the liver itself wasn&#39;t my cup of tea- mind you I&#39;m not an organ novice, but the gaminess was strong even for liver.  I had the duck pappardelle which was pretty good, pasta had good bite and the ragu was richly spiced...hit the spot on a cold night.  Overall pasta was good, rest needed work, but would consider giving it a second try (maybe in warmer weather!)",189,2,3,4,54,3.3808,1.3010000000000002,0.33,5.3709999999999996,No

The menu offers a refreshingly unique take on traditional pastas and a smattering of delicious sounding appetizers. The artichoke crostini was very good and well seasoned--the herbs complemented the flavors of the asparagus very well, and the artichoke was a nice savory addition to the acidity of the bruschetta. I also loved the cannelloni--normally I don&#39;t like cheeses made from sheep&#39;s milk, but the manchego added an extra dimension to the meaty flavors of the lamb. The arrabiata had a nice bit of heat in the tomato sauce and was quite good as well, although not as interesting as the other two entrees we ordered. The restaurant is a little on the loud side, which makes it slightly difficult to have conversation, but overall the food was very solid.

Loop?Well finally, on a cool Spring night, I was able to experience Monteverde.  What your mother taught you as a small child is the best advice that I have and that is to SHARE!  That way, you get to taste all of the goodness that is Monteverde.With a name that means &#34;green mountain&#34; I wished the night had been warmer as the windows clearly open to the street, the ambiance, while casual is the perfect place to enjoy one of their fabulous wines and the service staff loving what they are doing.Case in point.  Our server, Chris, was amazing.  His story (do I believe it?) was that he was fast becoming a regular at Monteverde when he decided to ask them for a position.  Hired on the spot, this guy is quite the Brand Ambassador telling us about the wine he loves, the food he serves and the overall essence of the restaurant.  I could have sat in his section all night but I get that he has to turn the table to make any money.We started with a range of small plates from the prosciutto butter toast, to the octopus and the mozzarella and ham. We probably ordered too much (seems to be a trend with me) but we loved everything that we had.  Some of their pasta is homemade on site so be sure to order some of that.

We planned a double date with some friends that geek out and pig out over great food just as much as we do. We had hoped for a weekend reservation, but the word is out and this is a hard reservation. Even a month out, we had to settle for a weeknight.There is a dining area in the front of the restaurant and high top tables along the side and back of the bar.

From my perch, I could see them skillfully roll and cut pasta. It was mesmerizing.We started out with a round of drinks while we perused the menu. I went with the Monte Mule and split a bottle of white with a table mate for the rest of the meal. We opted to share most of our dishes, so we could sample a nice cross section of the menu. We started out with the artichoke and sunchoke crostini, hamachi crudo, and two other dishes I can&#39;t recall. My favorite of them all was the crostini; it was delicious.For the main course, the three meat eaters split the ragu and I ordered the gnocchetti. The meat eaters raved about the ragu. A very generous portion, I think it was almost too much for them. My dish was a bit of a surprise. I was expecting a form of gnocchi, but gnocchetti is actually a delicate little shell pasta. The dish was very good; simple, straightforward flavors.Stuffed from all of the good food, we opted to drink our dessert.

Monteverde has always been one of the places I wanted to try, but the desire wasn&#39;t strong enough. Getting a prime time table on OpenTable also needed quite a bit of an effort, so I never made it there despite literally being a neighbor. Friends have said great things and F&amp;W magazine rated it as one of the new restaurants in the country. So on a Friday, my husband and I made it to a 9:30pm reso.Loved the elegant rustic vibe interior.

We got the hamachi crudo, wok fried chicken livers, cacio whey pepe and the pork shank ragu. Yup, a little bit too much for for two people and we had already cut down on the salad! Every item was wonderfully executed and the profile flavors came together very nicely. By the time we got to the ragu dish, we were already half filled up. Plus, that dish is huge, enough to share between 4 people especially it came with pasta, meatballs, sausages, and the gigantic pork shank. The dish was full of flavor and we had leftovers for breakfast ( Side note: this dish gets more flavorful the next day. We briefly chatted with Jaime, the Maitre D, who said that the ragu dish was intended for diners to have leftovers. It&#39;s supposed to reminiscent of your Sicilian grandmother (if you&#39;re Sicilian!) making you a big meal with leftovers for the next day.They had also just put the panna cotta dessert on the menu that day, which we tried.

No question about the food - it was very nice. The NOISE is a different matter, though. The 4* rating reflects outdoor dining only; if we had dined indoors, it would have been 1* -- if we had stayed.VIBE: hip, trendy. Nice d’©cor indoors, coherent design - well thought-out. It became apparent at the host stand, though, that we would not be able to tolerate the NOISE indoors. Fortunately, there was a table available outside on lovely Madison St - ambiance, meh, but at least we could hold a conversation. I do not get why restaurateurs do this noise thing; it is neither &#34;energetic&#34; nor &#34;hip&#34; - it is simply assaultive.SERVICE: Our server was cordial &amp; helpful and clearly answered our questions about the menu. Food courses were reasonably well-spaced, although we were warned upfront that plates would come out as they were ready. I&#39;d say service was leisurely, with our server becoming scarcer as the evening wore on. We were in no hurry, but if you have a time constraint, advise the server upfront.GOOD: We liked everything - good flavor combinations &amp; balance, excellent textures. Yelp comments regarding over salting did not ring true for us (and we are sensitive to salt); maybe those diners came on chef&#39;s night off? Pasta was superb (spaghetti alla chitarra, twin ravioli). Green mountain salad was perfectly fresh &amp; crisp, with delicious vinaigrette. Bourbon caramel peach sundae was so tasty, as was cappuccino. Kudos to the wine director: the wine list is wide and varied in region and price point.NOT SO GOOD: Fiore di zucco special was tasty, but more heavily breaded than we prefer. No big deal.Much as we enjoyed our meal, we can only tolerate Monteverde&#39;s outdoor seating.

Fantastic menu; the ragu is a &#34;must&#34; order; extremely generous serving of pasta that is a meat lover&#39;s delight - filled with giant meat balls, sausages and a Berkshire pork shank (easily large enough to share among a party of four, but also amazing as leftovers the next day if ordered by a smaller party). While the house-made pastas are the star here, have enjoyed everything I&#39;ve ordered from the spicy nduja arancini to the artichoke &amp; sunchoke crostini to the massive bone-in ribeye. Try to save room for dessert as they are strong as well! Monteverde is one of those few venues that manages to combine quality and quantity yet offer a stellar value.  Very strong wine program to complement the cuisine (and like the food, the wines are very reasonably priced) - absolutely loved the Turner Pageot Le Rouge and at $39 per/bottle it is a steal! The cocktails though were nothing special and just adequate. I often a enjoy some amaro with dessert but the amaris and digestifs are the one thing at Monteverde that seem overpriced; I opted to stick with coffee in lieu of an adult beverage with my sweets (fortunately they feature Sparrow coffee and have a delicious roast ). The food is stronger at Monteverde than the service and ambiance; not that either of these categories are subpar - they are just not as top notch as the food. The space is aesthetically pleasing but tables are tightly spaced and the venue  becomes quite noisy when full (which is it daily aside from extremely early or extremely late in service). Service was sufficiently attentive, polished and friendly - but just not quite as warm and personable to be considered top notch.

I should have gone for the pappardelle, but I wanted to be healthy and went for the stuffed cabbage instead--- I would recommend passing on that--- no need to try to fool yourself into thinking you&#39;re healthy when there are so many hearty dishes you need to try here. My gf and I went for the ragu alla napoletana, and didn&#39;t really how massive it was. It definitely could have fed a table of 4 instead of just us two. I happily took the leftovers home and had about 3 more meals out of it--- can&#39;t believe I hesitated on taking it home since we were going out to the bars afterwards--- who cares though when the food here is that good?!Service here was great, and the wine I had at the bar while we waited for our table was good as well.

The spices were done well too. Their dessert was just okay and honestly, the server&#39;s recommendation of how much food we should order was way overboard for 2 people.

monteverde-chicago,Rachel P.,6A-VKaa_WIipUIcVqEh51Q,g6s49ioWnPN3LZpFEij4cw,"I&#39;m a die-hard fan of all things Top Chef-related and couldn&#39;t wait to try the latest from another show alum. I made Friday night dinner reservations for my fiance and I about a month in advance, and we enjoyed our meal overall. We were seated right at our reservation time, and our server Darma was friendly and prompt. The atmosphere was hip/casual, high-end decor. Loved the upholstered dinner chairs with arms to them! We were started off with a mason jar of their in-house baked rosemary cracker breadsticks, which definitely had herby flavor but were maybe a tad too dense for my taste, making them a little dry vs. light and crisp. They were missing that airiness for me. For drinks, my fiance had the Saba bourbon soda, and I had the non-alcoholic saba soda, which was like a fancy grape soda, and very tasty. I&#39;d hope so though, for $5 for club soda and a glorified simple syrup. We chose the Nduja arancini and the stuffed cabbage topped with a fried egg as appetizers. The arancini were delicious; perfectly hot, crisp outside with a flavorful, tender inside, with a little bit of heat. The cabbage filling was good, but neither my fiance or I were crazy about the texture of the cabbage itself, my fiance comparing it to a booger, how very appetizing. For an entree, we shared the cannelloni saltimbocca, which was hands down the best thing we had. The prosciutto, sage, lamb, and balsamic were SO good together; I wish the portion size was a little bigger for their sharing plate concept, that one seemed more like a one-person meal. Probably because it was so delicious I did not want to share it at all. For dessert, we went with the cookie sundae, which was a flop for us aside from that dazzling sesame ice cream. I&#39;m not sure what type of cookie comes in it (shortbread, maybe?), but my fiance and I agreed it was way off on the proper cookie-to-ice cream ratio. The majority of it was basically a bowl of incredibly hard and crunchy (and kind of large, for a topping) cookie chunks sitting on 1/2 scoop of sesame ice cream and 1/2 scoop of milk and honey ice cream, sprinkled with sesame seeds on top. The cookie chunks, aside from being too hard and too big to comfortably take bites of with a spoon of ice cream, were pretty bland flavor-wise, as was the milk and honey ice cream that I wouldn&#39;t have known wasn&#39;t plain vanilla if it hadn&#39;t been written. But oh, the sesame ice cream. Package that and sell take-home pints and I will be there every week. It was reminiscent of a peanut butter ice cream with a tang to it, and is definitely on my list as one of the best ice cream flavors I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;d honestly order just a few scoops of sesame ice cream a la carte next time.We were surprised by a couple of misses food-wise, but the high points were high enough for me to give them a pass this time. The prices for the food quality and portions were reasonable, and we would definitely give Monteverde another visit to try some of the other menu items.",359,4,4,5,102,8.373,3.603,0.9220000000000002,21.476,No
monteverde-chicago,Jennifer P.,bDXSrl19qIe0Hb-cZcCJ5A,7imd5AyTPnnSAhLzPQgDsA,"Monteverde is currently featuring a $33 pp menu for Restaurant Week 2016. We shared:Tortellini in Brodo:Mortadella (pork sausage) tortellini soup in a rich broth with barely-cooked celery and carrots. No mushy veggies here! I was a total fan of the slight crunch and tiny dice!Lasagne Bolognese:VERY hearty 3-meat lasagne with bechamel and parmesean between the layers. Definitely comfort food!Coconut, Cherry, and Milk Sorbet w/&#34;Forgotten&#34; Cookies:The cherry sorbet by itself was intense - almost too much so! Definitely get a bit of the milk and/or coconut sorbets in the same bite! The Forgotten Cookies are a chewy merengue with cherries and chocolate. The more substantial cookie paired with the refreshing sorbet was the perfect ending to the meal! Chef Sarah&#39;s cookie recipe is published online via Food &amp; Wine, by the way.You can opt for the additional wine pairings for the above menu ($15). We went with beer instead: he had the Moody Tongue Chocolate Churro Porter ($8), which, to me, had more of a bitter &#34;bite.&#34; I had the Stone Coffee Milk Stout ($7) which tasted like beer + coffee had a baby. Yum!Aside from the Restaurant Week Menu, we shared:Hand-rolled Pappardelle ($14):Soft noodles with bits of olive and duck ragu. Adequately meaty and nice flavor overall. This was my second favorite.Black truffle pasta dish (...the exact name escapes me  $34):This was my favorite: the noodles were more firm, the herbs were simple, and the truffle lended a great rich flavor.  Despite being oily (and no bread with which to sop up the goodness) it was pretty darn delicious! The portion size was the smallest, though (of course you&#39;re primarily paying for the truffle). There were about 5 large slices in the dish.The complimentary rosemary breadsticks satisfied a &#34;crunch craving,&#34; but disintegrated into powder and were VERY dry.My guy changed our reservation from 7:30 to 8:30pm without issue and were seated immediately. Service was good without being overbearing, and our server (Adam) walked us through both menus and answered questions. We received new plates and cutlery after our second dish, and our little table messes were wiped away twice.The atmosphere is rustic-meets-contemporary. At 8:30 it was very loud, which was definitely a big conversation killer. It quieted down significantly by 10, but that&#39;s not saying much since it was a Thursday evening. I also feel like they tried to cram as much seating in as possible: the bar area and raised table seating behind it seemed to be the tightest spot. Servers and patrons had to squeeze through and I saw a few people almost get clocked in the head with trays, carafes, and dishes. Patrons standing at the bar didn&#39;t help matters.The fresh ingredients, adequate portions, and view of the pasta-making-in-progress makes this a pretty nice spot overall.",362,4,2,5,17,6.567100000000001,4.705,1.546,25.748999999999995,No

The bar area was quite big and we probably could have found a seat (we got there early) but put our name in and grabbed a drink down the street. The food was fantastic!  Some of the best Italian in the city.  Gave 4 stars only because I think we ordered too much and were very full by the end.  We asked the waiter to help and make sure we were ordering a good amount. I wish he would have advised against 1 less dish and it would have been perfect!  The tortellini was by far the star!  I could eat this every day!  We also tried artichoke crostini, prosciutto toast, bucatini, and a seafood pasta special.

Two pasta dishes and the Skate entree on the menu.The appetizers were good.  The octopus was tasty.  We got the Mountain Salad as well.  It was great but didn&#39;t taste all that Italian.  Which fine with me.  The dressing had more of a ginger/Asian feel that normally would be associated with a Japanese spot.  It was good.The pasta dishes were both good as well.

It was a nice way to finish the meal.  Lots of drink options and a decent, Italian focused wine menu.  To eat well it&#39;s probably about $50 per person which would include a drink or two.

So happy to have another solid restaurant in the neighborhood.  We had awaited the opening of the gorgeous new restaurant on the corner of Carpenter and Madison.  We finally made it for dinner over the weekend.  They have a nice space and the restaurant looks fantastic.  The front of the restaurant has a few long communal tables and a few four tops.  High tops and bar seating fill out the rest of the place.  As we were dining early, it was pretty open.  The host tried to seat us at the front communal table and I wasn&#39;t having it.  Maybe if we were a group, but when a couple show up we likely want something more intimate.  They took us to a secluded table in the back near the kitchen and it was much better.Let&#39;s eat!  We asked a few questions about the menu, specifically how much to order.  The menu is a combination of snacks, small plates, pastas and entrees for the table.  We got a bunch as we wanted to try a few things, and I wanted some leftovers.  Here&#39;s how we did it...ARTICHOKE CROSTINO salt roasted beets, Bohemian blue quark cheese spread, hazelnutsOCTOPUS SPIEDINI leek, Japanese sweet potato, pimenton, peperonataARRABBIATA wok fried orecchiette, head-on gulf shrimp, tomato, toasted garlic &amp; hot pepper oil CANNELLONI SALTIMBOCCA prosciutto, lamb, sage, balsamic, cauliflower bechamelGNOCCHETTI SARDI Vesuvio tomato sugo, basil, house made ricotta DUCK EGG CORZETTI duck ragu, taggiasca olives, pecan pestoWe liked it all.  As usual, my little lady loved the beets.  Other highlights were the Arrabbiata (best of show), the duck ragu, the gnocchetti and the saltimbocca.  Standard Italian dishes are executed with added flair, like the saltimbocca that was rolled and sliced up sushi style.  I&#39;d like to see some cheeses on the menu and a few more entrees that would include added fish options beyond skatewing.  Seated right by the pass, we were able to watch all of the dishes as they came out of the kitchen.  The massive portion of ragu looked delicious and I&#39;ll have to try that sometime I&#39;ve got a hungry carnivore with me.  We finished up with a few espressos and the Salted Caramel Budino that was every bit as good as it sounds.  We had a wonderful meal at Monteverde and are excited to have a new dining option so close in the neighborhood.   Grazie e buona fortuna!",284,4,2,5,34,8.282300000000003,3.638,0.055,21.307,No

Chicken Livers-even betterFor dinner we took two different pastas and it was very good. They make their own pasta all the time and you can see that progress (if you seat at the bar) in making.

I was flying back to NYC and had time to eat before departing to the airport.  Restaurant was empty. Food: Overall, nothing special. Just because a restaurant makes fresh pasta doesn&#39;t guarantee quality and/or authenticity. I love Italian food and spent time learning to cook in Northern Italy. Italian food is as diverse as Chinese and Persian. What confuses me about Monteverde is &#39;where is its Italian soul?&#39;.    The location is trendy but the food is an embarrassment to my Italian grandmother.Service:- Spotty is the best I can say. Waitress snatched menu while I was trying to read the cocktails.- Never talked to waitress after ordered dishes.- We poured our own bottle of wine through out the meal.Conclusions:Another random trendy restaurant that is more hyped than quality.

I ordered the beef cheek pasta and was unable to eat more than one piece of the beef, just focusing on the noodles and mushrooms instead.

Safe to say this has never happened to me before.The appetizer (salmon belly) and dessert (cannoli) were lovely, but I was disappointed that the main meal was such a flop.A side note about the service: I was half an hour late for my reservation, and the woman up front told my friend and I that our only option at that point was to eat at the bar.

I saw Monteverde featured on several articles outlining hot new restaurants and was excited to try this place. When we walked in, we were instantly impressed with the atmosphere. It had a trendy feel, and we definitely liked the bar set-up. With that said, it deeply hurts me to say that my friend and I were pretty disappointed by our dining experience.For drinks, I ordered the Monteverde mule, which I found to be delicious. My friend ordered wine, tasted it, and found it to be unsatisfactory. She ended up ordering another wine, which was ok.To start, they provide these crispy rosemary cracker type sticks, which are quite delicious and addictive. For starters, we ordered the arancini and prosciutto butter toast. The arancini was AMAZING. The butter toast was good, but rich. This excited us for our next course...but alas, disappointment ensued.Our next order was Green Mountain Salad and Tortellini in Brodo. The salad was good, but was nothing really special. The Tortellini in Brodo had promise, but was pretty salty. After a couple of bites, it became harder to eat.Our pasta dishes included the Arrabbiata and Cacio Whey Pepe. Typically, I love Arrabbiata, but again, our dish was so salty it was truly inedible. I never send food back and we actually had to in this case. If you like pepper, you will like the Cacio Whey Pepe as it is made with 5 different types of pepper. Unfortunately, after our salty experience with the Arrabbiata, the Cacio seemed salty too.With our disappointing dinner experience, we were too afraid to order dessert and face further sadness.

We went on opening night (to the public) and made a reservation. We got a table in the back with a view of the kitchen. While I will agree that the front desk was not the friendliest (or perhaps we were overly giddy to be there and they just didn&#39;t match our excitement!) our waitress on the other hand was wonderful. We also noticed Sarah walking around greeting tables and also working hard in the kitchen. We ordered: Kale Palotes, Oma&#39;s Green Mountain Salad, Mozzarella e Ham, Gnocchetti Sardi, Tortelli di Zucca and Prime Rib. For dessert we ordered Sbrisolona Sundae and Salted Butterscotch Budino. (YES - we ordered a lot for 2 people but wanted to sample a fair amount.) Of these the Gnocchetti was our favorite dish - absolutely amazing and refreshing (not a potato based gnocchi like you might think). The fresh cherry tomato sauce is to die for.  We also really enjoyed the Kale Palotes to start which were packed with flavor. The Mozzarella and Ham was wonderful however a little difficult to eat with all of those round shapes in a flat sandwich. Delicious nonetheless. Also - both desserts were yummy - I preferred the Budino and my husband the sundae - next time we will definitely try the sorbet - this wasn&#39;t on the menu when we went. Excited to see what other adjustments are made to the menu - perhaps more group friendly apps for the pre-Hawks/Bulls game crowds or even a pizza section would go nicely...but what do I know everything is good as-is.

The work here needs to be on their customer service if they want to maintain local loyalty and word-of-mouth once the initial hype wears away. Despite there being 4 hostesses I basically felt I had to barge into the stand to announce we were there for our reservation.They said our table wasn&#39;t ready and sent us to the bar. Great cocktails but when our table was finally ready (about 20 mins after res time) they simply told us and left us to settle up our check at the bar (which took another 10 mins). Our table wasn&#39;t even in the main dining room but next to the bar, which was ok but typically those are for non-reservation diners, right? I ordered the Gruner wine--it came improperly chilled and when I complained the waitress brought over an ice bucket. Get your wine together, Monteverde---especially at $40 a bottle. The wine also wasn&#39;t good in taste--tasted cheap and wasn&#39;t even corked. Service was slow, inattentive and at times, frankly rude. The restaurant probably lost about $50-$60 in additional drink and dish sales as there was a gap of nearly 30 mins after our initial courses were done that we got any attention--food plates and wine bottle empty. My mother literally had to get up and ask the waitress to pay attention to us. Left with a really sour taste and it wasn&#39;t only from the lousy wine. Took my parents to Maude&#39;s for post-dinner drinks where the customer service was phenomenal as usual---saved our night.Food is wonderful and reasonable--I appreciated the handmade noodles and breads and things. The cheeses and produce and ingredients were also fresh and unique but a good dining experience is half the battle and the service was truly disappointing.",191,2,1,0,-37,-0.4776,1.067,2.067,12.866,No

The bf and I both started with the sardinian bandit, we love our light and frothy egg white cocktails. The super long and crunchy breadsticks are complimentary. The artichoke &amp; sunchoke crostini was very good. The arrabbiata was super saucy and not as spicy as others mentioned. The shrimp were plump and cooked perfectly.

Only after eating here did I learn that the owner is a former Top Chef contestant.  Upon realizing this I was quite upset as the food we received would have gotten less than stellar reviews from picky judges.In a word, the food was bland.  Nothing was bad or inedible but nothing was great either.  Everything needed more salt, more acid, and more herbs.

I liked the spice coming through.  The ragu alla napoletana was something that reminded me of a dish you make a home.  Nothing on that massive plate impressed.  The meatballs were the best of the bunch but that&#39;s not saying much.  And I still haven&#39;t figured out how sausage can have no flavor.Adding to the above, the space is obnoxiously loud.

I ordered the biscuit and gravy with two eggs, and my friend ordered a bowl that had the works. We also ordered the corn pudding, mashed potatoes with gravy, and mac n cheese on the side. The cheese kind of smelled/tasted like... velveeta.I&#39;m sure that we may have just ordered the wrong things but not only was there a bit of a wait (30+ minutes...) but my food was lukewarm to cold, the mashed potatoes and gravy resembled that out of a tv-dinner box, and the mac n cheese was... pretty gross, to be honest. My biscuit and gravy dish was incredibly disappointing - if would have been only slightly better had it come out hot. I had wished that I just ordered a biscuit with eggs at that point, but I could not even scrape the overwhelming amount of bland gravy off of everything. The taste... was like leftover rotisserie chicken + bacon grease with cornstarch.The one decent dish - corn pudding (basically corn bread pudding).

It was beautiful sunny day, so we opted to sit around back on the patio, which had some cute strung porch lights, just enough shade, and 5ish tables. You had to walk around the block and through some people&#39;s backyards to get from the main front part of the restaurant to the patio in the back, but it wasn&#39;t too hard to find.  Lively, but not-overcrowded. We got to sit down right away without any wait.I got the pulled pork hash with 2 over medium eggs and a slice of wheat toast. The hash browns were a mix of Idaho potatoes and sweet potatoes, lightly salted and seasoned, and browned to perfection. Sweet onions and pulled pork were grilled into the potato mix and then everything was topped with the fried eggs and toast. I thought the pork had a bit too much gristle/fat in it and didn&#39;t have any nice crispy bits like you&#39;d normally get in pan fried pulled port or carnitas. Pulled pork shouldn&#39;t be disappointing, but this definitely was (really, how can anyone do fatty pork badly?). Everything else on my plate was done really well though.My 2 friends got the chicken and sausage pesto hash and the blackened catfish benedict (both were summer specials). The pesto hash was delicious (and I mean delicious!), but definitely on the heavy side and a little too much oil for any one person to eat. It was basically potato hash browns, pan fried sausage and chicken thigh pieces, all coated in pesto and topped with eggs/toast. I should have gone with the catfish benedict, which was pepper cornbread topped with blackened catfish, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce.

We ended up getting the regular French fries (they do offer sweet potato fries) and collard greens. All their sides are made in house except for the fried okra. The best way I can explain the rotisserie chicken is El Pollo Loco style. They serve it with flour tortillas and salsa. The chicken is tender and still juicy - perfectly seasoned chicken skin. The French fries are on point - freshly made, crisp, and salty. They have homemade ketchup as well!Collard greens are a must in my opinion. They are slightly spiced, tender but not fall apart - a skill that is difficult to master. The greens are cooked with ham for that slight pork flavor we all love. For dessert, we were able to sample the banana pudding!

Ryan, the manager, was very accommodating and appreciative of the heads up that a large group was coming in.Ryan had our table set up and we arrived with our BYO supplies. He came over to our table to help us put together a group order with roasted chicken, pulled pork, pulled chicken, and catfish along with sides of Mac &amp; cheese, mashed potatoes, sweet potato fries, collard greens, and cornbread. Even though only a few people were interested in trying the catfish, we ended up ordering two more servings! Everything was very good, but I think the cornbread battered fried catfish was the biggest hit.We wrapped things up with some banana pudding and chocolate cake, which were delicious.All told, with a 30% tip included (great service and efforts to accommodate us), the bill came to $12 a piece (cash only).

I regret not getting one of the specials because the eggs benedict was just marginal. Instead of English muffins, the eggs were on cornbread. The eggs were cooked perfect! The fried green tomatoes they sit on were ok, but the cornbread was blah. The corn pudding which I subbed for the potatoes was pretty good.

(We tried the collard greens, cornbread pudding, fried okra, succotash, bean of the month, coleslaw, sweet potato fries, and the mashed potatoes and gravy.)All the entrees were delicious too. I had the quarter chicken and it was perfectly cooked and put on a tortilla which was a nice little added bonus since it soaked up the juices. It also came with an unexpected side of fire roasted salsa which went really well with the tortilla and the chicken.The food alone was worthy of five stars but Ryan kicked it up a notch and made it a 7 star dining experience. He was extremely helpful with giving us recommendations for sides and explaining how all the food is prepared. You could immediately tell he loved his job and took pride in what he did and it definitely came through in the food.For dessert we let Ryan choose for us and he nailed it.

The owner called up her mother and asked if she could make a special batch for my co-worker and she happily obliged... two dozen were made fresh that afternoon.

bottlefork-chicago,Minjee K.,5bAJVv1mbF3FArm5jDmM2w,Q-Lbq-_unLqplxep0EQJWA,"This place just became my favorite bar in Chicago, beating the broken shaker or aviary. Well-crafted and proper cocktails, cool bartenders whose recommendations were solid, and excellent burgers. Wanting to grab a drink after work, we first walked into Three Dots and a Dash next door. It is probably my mistake thinking I can walk into a popular bar on Friday and enjoy myself, but it was quite an unpleasant scene unless you are looking to get your shoulder bumped by young and rude patrons all night. Instead of getting a second round of drinks, we moved on to Bottlefork. While Bottlefork was also busy, we were lucky enough to grab two seats at the bar. Our plan to grab a drink before dinner turned into:1. Bill Brasky (2.5x drink in terms of size and potency; my favorite of the night - smooth and nicely balanced, with a cool large ice cube slowly melting)2. Differences of Character (Scotch drink with Allspice Dram, with a hint of honey and lemon - surprisingly good for a hot summer night) 3. For the Allocation (A twist on Manhattan, with Genepy and Gran Classico instead of vermouth)4. Smoke of the Day  5. Big Salty Tears (What a nice find! Egg-white smoothing out Sherry and Whiskey, with *disciplined* sage leaf on top)I honestly enjoyed all our drinks, with Bill Brasky and Big Salty Tears being two favorites. Ground Bacon Burger was perfect to soak up the alcohol, and I was happy to try Poutine (with braised beef cheek) south of the Canadian border. Their fries were just okay and could have been crispier.   The best part of the Bottlefork is actually the bartenders - Adam and Blaine were our two bartenders, who gave the most on-point recommendations for both drinks and food.

I believe it was on Facebook when I first saw the brunch menu and sundaes and bookmarked it. Quite shocked that it took me this long to finally visit considering its walking distance from my flat.My bff and I visited Bottlefork by accident. It was Easter Sunday morning and we had plans to drop by Hub 51 for their buffet. They were packed and the buffet was almost over so we took a stroll and stumbled upon Bottlefork. I was so excited to dine.Upon entry the first thing I noticed was the absolutely stunning mural on the wall. The host was amazing as well. We were immediately sat in a booth at the front across from the bar. Very comfy seating and very beautiful interior decor. Evem menus themselves were beautiful. Props to whomever designed the interior and the menus.Both of us ordered the Wagyu Steak Salad. It was prepared quickly and came out fresh. I loved the flavors. My friend however thought the arugula was a bit too bitter. Even though I loved the salad, I am still trying to find justification for the price point which is why i docked 1 star. I do think it was five dollars too expensive. I docked another star because our waiter did not follow up with us, and he was not as personable as our hostess was. I want to return to try a sundae.

Overall, pleased with the place!They sat us down in a super tiny table for 2 that was super close to the people next to us. As the night progressed, it got louder and louder, which was kind of annoying. Not a fan of restaurants that have that type of seating.We started with the Happy Hour specials. I had the Gin &amp; Tonic Hendricks special for $8 and omg was it strong. Almost too strong for my liking. I asked for simple syrup on the side to help kill some of that taste. I guess you get your money&#39;s worth but I like to enjoy my cocktails. My friend got the Brazillian for $10 and was happy with her drinks. Note, we had to ask for the Happy Hour menu and it had 4 Gin mixed drinks on it for $8.For food we got WAY too much. The portions are pretty large. We started with the Tots which were delicious! The pimiento sauce is so good. We then got the Orecchiette pasta which was pleasantly good. A little overwhelming/heavy after a while but the flavors were on point. We also ordered the Fried Chicken which was a huge mistake, mostly because it was HUGE. It&#39;s basically an entire chicken fried. It was good but nothing all that mind blowing. Pretty basic fried chicken. The popover biscuit that came with it was so yummy.We ended the night with the Pretzel Caramel Chocolate Sundae/shake thing. SO GOOD. Don&#39;t skip it!

bottlefork-chicago,Eric S.,rkdE06BbheP4gEhb3ooH0w,uYhZ-IbM5KGrI3fLEhIz2A,"No point in keeping one&#39;s opinions all bottled up.Finally got a chance to experience this River North hotspot, and apart from a few minor grievances, things here are A-OK.  More than okay, actually.My intention was to grab a drink at Gilt Bar&#39;s snazzy subterranean speakeasy (The Library), but upon hearing that the wait was upwards of 2 hours (!!!), Susan S and I decided to head elsewhere.  And so The Library&#39;s loss is Bottlefork&#39;s gain.Despite a packed house on a Friday night at 9pm, seating at the bartop was plentiful so we grabbed a couple chairs at the end and began perusing the lengthy menu.  While the food menu had some interesting entries--grilled venison, beef cheek poutine--the drink menu definitely stole the spotlight.  Bottlefork takes a page out of Three Dots &amp; A Dash&#39;s playbook (or is it the other way around?), in that their cocktail listing shows photos, so you know exactly what drink vessel you&#39;ll be getting.Also like Three Dots, each cocktail is delicious, carefully crafted, and made with ingredients you likely haven&#39;t heard of.  Becharovca?  Oleo sacharum?  G’©n’©pi des Alpes??  If you can tell me what those things are without the aide of Google, round of drinks on this guy.My &#39;Differences of Character&#39; was a scotch-based drink with allspice dram, honey, lemon, and ghost chile [$14].  A single giant ice cube occupied most of the space, so I felt a bit scammed on this one.  No matter, I followed that up with a muy grande order - the &#39;Blonde on Blonde&#39;.  Served in a splendid golden metallic pineapple, it was fashioned with Absolute Elyx (their top-of-the-line stuff), rum, white port, champagne, and chile de arbol [$26].  What made the drink so enjoyable, however, was the design of the vessel itself: the shiny faux fruit could be arranged of 1 of 3 different ways:1) normal, in the upright position (top on the top)2) quirky, with the leaves of the top acting as the base, drink sits inside the curved bottom (top on the bottom, inverted)3) just plain weird, with the bottom of the top acting as the base, drink sits on leaves (top on the bottom, upright)Did you get all that?  Good.  Moving on.The food was marked with highs and lows.  Wagyu jerky [$6] had strong flavors of soy and garlic, tasted like teriyaki, and was great for snacking.  The Kennebec fries [$6] were drizzled with a malt vinegar aioli, but apart from that weren&#39;t too noteworthy.  From there I ordered scallops (as I often do), and was not at all impressed.  Although cooked properly, the &#34;saltimbocca&#34; aspect of the dish was pretty lame, with the prosciutto almost nonexistent and the sage easily forgotten about.  For $16, I felt jipped.  But Bottlefork went and redeemed themselves with the next dish which consisted of...........Grilled octopus &amp; housemade &#39;Spam&#39; [$21].  Oh yes.  This was easily the standout course as well as one of the most unique, best-tasting items I&#39;ve had in some time.  Typically, octopus is all rubbery and bleh when I&#39;ve seen it, but it was seasoned and cooked so well I could barely tell that I was eating a cephalopod.  The &#39;Spam&#39; was precisely that, chunks of compressed loaf meat accompanied with Brussels sprout kimchi and sugar snap peas.  Truly an amazing plate that earned BF a whole heap of points from yours truly.Dessert was thoroughly meh.  We got a pretzel caramel + fudge sundae [$8] that came topped with a beer stout cream, in lieu of some aerosol can whipped nonsense.  Served in a tall glass, it was difficult to eat, and apart from the enticing stout &#34;float&#34;, the rest was forgettable.  It would&#39;ve been nice to see a greater variety of sweets besides just ice cream sundaes and peanut butter cheesecake.Our bartender/server was cool, and I noticed the staff re-positioning the bar chairs once people had left.  Interior was very dim, which makes for an ideal date night, but lousy for picture taking.  Attractive clientele base too, I like that.OH!  And I got to chat with the hostess about having Louis XIII de R’©my Martin (aka Louis Trez) as a drink offering.  Sh*t is crazy expensive, what with the blown crystal decanter and all.....the mere fact that Bottlefork carries this bumps them up a notch.Bread = 4Circuses = 5 (drink presentation included)Although the infamous Billy Dec is the owner, that doesn&#39;t mean Bottlefork succumbs to the same awfulness that is the Cubs-fan-and-rat-poop-filled Wrigleyville dump known as Rockit Bar &amp; Grill {{ sidenote: has it really been a year since the health department shut them down?  My how time flies.... }}  Quite the contrary, in fact.

They have a really nice list of cocktails here, and I decided to get the &#39;I Hope There&#39;s Always Snow in Your Driveway&#39; even though it was about 10 degrees out. Loved the flavors but will probably ask for it on the rocks next time since it took a little while to melt down and drink, but definitely great presentation.For apps, we ordered the braised beef cheeck poutine, which was really good, the wagyu beef jerky which was better than I thought it would be, and the grilled octopus and spam which was surprisingly very tasty. It&#39;s actually made with their housemade spam so it&#39;s way better than anything you&#39;d get out of a can, and the kimchee was a very nice touch.In terms of the drinks and apps, I&#39;d say this os a nice place to come to start off your night.

The place is dimly lit bit at least o can see my food! To be honest it does feel cramped with how the tables are laid out.  But don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll be distracted with the amazing food.  Here&#39;s what I had:TOTS - $7Pimento cheese drizzle.This bowl of what looked more like hashbrown cubes tastes like the wonderful hashbrowns from McDonald&#39;s, but topped with a creamy cheese sauce!  I liked it even though it doesn&#39;t taste so fancy.  &#34;BAG&#34; OF CRISPS + EGGS - $5Malt Vinegar Powder + Sea SaltSo this appetizer was presented to us by our server with a poached 45 second egg sprinkled with malt vinegar powder, and a brown paper bag of house made potato chips with sea salt.  She throws the egg in, closes the bag and starts shaking it like a bartender!  She poured it into the plate.  Although the I didn&#39;t taste much egg in this now ooey gooey chips, I thought it was quite tasty! Oh and it was free with Yelp check-in! CREAMED KALE - $8Wild Boar Bacon + Sunny Duck EggThis dish was not at all bitter.  I loved the creamed kale mashed up in the fried egg!  The small pieces of bacon reminds me of lardon and I love everything about this dish.  And no this doesn&#39;t not count as a salad! Haha!RICH MAN PO&#39; BOY - $25Lobster + Foie + Crispy OysterWow this sounds amazing!  I was so happy there was 3 of the sliders because there was 3 of us!  The bread looked like brioche and it was full of lobster! Each sandwich had a breaded and deep fried oyster with lots of relish/pickled onion that made it a tad overwhelming.  There was a shmear of foie that made it extra salty.  I love this and enjoyed it but it was on the saltier side.LAMB SIRLOIN - $28Moroccan Spiced Yogurt + Shaved Asparagus.The slices of lamb was very tender but it was also too salty.  I thought the yogurt would help that but it actually didn&#39;t.  I can tell the meat is good because of how it was cooked and cut, but the flavors just wasn&#39;t doing it for me.I overall enjoyed this place and loved the branding.  Such lovely handkerchiefs!

bottlefork-chicago,Claire S.,2YFmxZR0OZxq_1nHWquXMw,COOdy1sN8gGoRlO-rV_sSQ,"Bottlefork is my go-to restaurant to impress friends, dates, and out-of-town visitors. It&#39;s the quintessential Chicago restaurant - heavy on meats, intense on flavors, and balanced cocktails. And its brunch is arguably the best in the city. I have never had an issue getting a reservation here, even when I&#39;ve called a 1/2 hour before showing up. The host is always gracious, and the staff is friendly, but won&#39;t be up in your business. The service can be a little slow sometimes, but overall it&#39;s worth it. For brunch, two great items are the 2 Farm Eggs and the Baked french toast. 2 Farm Eggs will ruin you for regular eggs. The eggs are fresh and perfect, and the yolk and jam condiments make a great spread on the toast. As for the Baked French toast, this dish is a Chicago dessert enthusiast&#39;s fever dream. Its sweetness is balanced with the tart berry compote and the subtle smokiness from the bourbon maple syrup and the cast iron. Come early to order this, as they have run out of this in the past. And their Bloody Mary? DO ORDER IT. For dinner, as deliciously meat-heavy as the menu is, the salads have been stand-out. They&#39;re always fresh and flavorful, and they&#39;re a welcome respite from the heaviness of the other dishes. I&#39;m never unsatisfied when I order a salad here. Can&#39;t miss dishes: Ensalada Latina, Brussel Sprouts, Tots, Crisps and Eggs, Ground Bacon Burger, Kale Caesar Salad, Baked French toast, 2 Farm eggs any styleCan&#39;t miss drinks: I Hope There&#39;s Always Snow in Your Driveway, For the Allocation, Not Mescaline Either, Bottlefork Bloody MaryThe atmosphere is dark and cozy, and it doesn&#39;t have a ton of seating.

Oh lordy was I in heaven!  The Brussels sprouts were cooked to perfection, with a basalmic and oil drizzle that left me wanting more.   The burger was a mile-high pile of delicious toppings, including bacon and a generous helping of cheese and sauce.  I couldn&#39;t get enough.  Fries were included, so my meal was extremely filling--good thing my friends wanted to pick at everything too!  My parfait was absolutely glorious and tasty.  The RW menu said it was a &#34;mini&#34; version of their normal desserts but I couldn&#39;t even finish it, though I wanted to.  Incredible. The best thing about Bottlefork is the amazing service.  Eddie, our server, was an absolute delight.  Friendly, accommodating, helpful, and so so sweet.

They don&#39;t deserve any stars really.A restaurant needs to try hard to get this kind of rating from me. Me and my buddy came here Tuesday night for 930pm reservations through opentable (1000 point table) which was one of the deciding factors to come here and its decent reviews.As soon as we came in, I mentioned the reservation and this guy looks at his computer screen quickly and seats us. More on this later. We are seated and our waitress comes along and asks us about drinks, etc. Not the most cordial demeanor, but she continued to do small annoying things throughout the evening. She brought us room temperature water in a decanter that would only fill one glass at a time. She never refilled them without being told first. Mind you, this restaurant has a minimal amount of people at this time.We&#39;re ready to order and my buddy gets the pasta with chicken sausage and I get the burger and we share the appetizer tots. The burger was cooked as requested (medium rare)  but I asked for lettuce, onion, and tomato as well. In my experience, usually when you list things out like that, they serve those veggies raw. For some reason, they caramelized the onions. Not what I wanted. Not the end of the world. I&#39;ll just scrape the caramelized onions and ask for a side of raw onions. 5 excruciating minutes later it arrives. It should have taken 10 seconds especially when the kitchen was literally behind us. I&#39;ll end this quickly now, burger sucked. Bun was a little burned around the edges and the meat itself, although, cooked perfectly on the inside was too charred on the outside and had a charred burned taste at times. Not to mention I bit into a piece of fat while eating it and needed to spit it out.The pasta and tots, however, were worth 4/5 themselves. Oh, and lastly, I received an email from opentable asking me why I didn&#39;t fulfill my reservation.

We ended up dining at the bar and it was just fine, with the service as average. I ordered the skillet French toast, and boy was I excited. The presentation was killer, and the item itself looked and smelled amazing. However, when I took a bite, the French toast was quite bland. Sure, the carmelized sugar around the edges were a great touch (I mean, it&#39;s all done in a skillet) but it just tasted very &#34;bread-y&#34; and dry, when I like my French toast to taste soft and moist. Sitting at the bar, we had a great view of the kitchen, and I pin pointed why the French toast had the consistency that it did-- it&#39;s a frozen bread package that&#39;s dipped in egg and thrown in the skillet. No wonder! Mimosas were average. The Wood Grilled Ground Bacon Burger was also ordered at a table, and that was delicious! In regards to the side dish that is the bacon slab on side, it&#39;s quite undercooked and extremely thick. I was surprised that our server didn&#39;t ask us how we wanted it cooked.

I&#39;ve always loved loud and dimly lit places for some odd reason; it gives you a nice homely feeling and a lively vibe. We got seated near the back of the restaurant and quickly ordered because we were so hungry. My friends and I got wings as appetizers, a burger, pasta, and gnocchi. Surprisingly when our food came the gnocchi was in a really small sized dish, which to me looked like a kid&#39;s bowl. It was supposed to be a main dish $16 and I think it&#39;s completely fine that fancy restaurants are pricey with small portions but when I glanced at it, it seriously looked like it was half eaten; food on one side and the spoon covered the other which barely had anything there. My only complaint is that it was not presentable at all. My friend was extremely upset by the portion and expressed it to the waiter, who made a joke about it. It wasn&#39;t very nice since my friend was clearly upset. He offered Brussels sprouts with it, which I thought was to make up for it but turns out he just suggested it and we had to pay for it. Ok, didn&#39;t make things better. My friend decided to speak to the manager, who was extremely nice (and cute!) about the situation and apologetic. He went to speak to the waiter and soon after the waiter came back to apologize (I seriously give him props for that because it&#39;s not always easy to apologize). The mood lightened up a bit and the manager came by again (all eyes on him cause did I mention he was cute?!) and offered us hot cheese cake for desserts. It was so nice of him and since I&#39;ve never tried hot cheese cake, I was super excited!Aside from all of that happening, I actually really like the food. I loved the hot wings, the burger, the pasta (probably my favorite dish), the gnocchi, and the Brussels sprouts! I definitely didn&#39;t mind paying for that because to me, the golden rule to food is if you offer delicious, tasty, good quality food the price doesn&#39;t matter - I will pay it. If I&#39;m ever in Chicago again I will definitely stop by and try something else. The only reason I&#39;m giving it a three star is because of the experience my friends and I got especially since it was our first time in Chicago, our first night, and the first restaurant we tried out.

We were promptly sat and some of us ordered cocktails and the others got a bottle of wine. We also put in the order for our food at same time, about 7 share plates. Cocktails arrived still waiting on wine. Then the dishes came out one by one. We probably had 4 dishes already and still no wine. Clearly picking up the forks way before the bottle here. They told us they didn&#39;t have any chilled bottles and it would be a min. Dishes 5-6 arrived and finally they decided to bring over 2 chilled glasses to compensate for the wait. But wine would be coming soon. We then only had one dish left and wine bottle was still not here, so we opted to cancel because at this point no one wanted to chug down a full bottle with the dinner over...they didn&#39;t seem too pleased that we canceled the bottle, but come on...this was on you. Why didn&#39;t you just tell us from the get go that this wine wasn&#39;t ready? We could have ordered another one...As for food...underwhelming. The mussels and lamb ribs were our last two dishes and we were very excited for them since we wanted to end meal on high note. Mussels down right fishy. So unpleasant. And the lamb was tough, and just a bit too gamey, and fatty. Not good. The best part were the truffle chips, which was the cheapest item we ordered. Seems like they need to pay much more emphasis to the higher quality ingredients than on the junk food. Gnocchi was mediocre, Brussels sprouts very salty, meatball flatbread held its own and was pretty good, but spicier than expected since no indication of that on menu...We opted out of dessert because it wasn&#39;t worth risking any more $$ on food that just may continue to be lackluster.The redeeming notes were that the cocktails were very good and they comped some money off the bill, which was a good courtesy given this underwhelming experience. Too many other great establishments in Chicago than to recommend coming back here.

Bottlefork was rated best Brunch in Chicago in an article I read and had the vibes I was looking for after a massive Friday night hangover. First of all, the location of this restaurant is great. We (my best friend and I) had walked to the restaurant from the Intercontinental hotel and were pleased that it was around everything we wanted to do, specifically the shopping. So if you&#39;re trying to make the best out of your time you have nothing to lose.The decor and atmosphere of this restaurant is so cool and unique that I wish I could have taken pictures! (My phone was unfortunately dead though- which is also an excuse to go back!) The drink menu. Let me just stop for a moment and clap my hands at the legendary drink menu here. I&#39;m not quite sure I&#39;ve seen as many mixed drinks and cocktails I wanted to try so badly. All of the drinks seemed uniquely crafted with expertise and amazing ingredients. They do not mess around when it comes to making the ultimate Bloody Mary either. It definitely was pleasing! Lastly, the food was amazing.

bottlefork-chicago,Shane W.,Gh_Gf26me3swBdhvMr4Vuw,zM8NEPBikmdEZrHhlyod7A,"Full disclosure: I&#39;m pretty much writing this review based on the amaziness of their Bag of Crips + Egg &#34;snack&#34; item.  Woooooooooow.  They start with their housemade chips (cut quite thin) which come out in a paper bag.  Alongside is an egg which has been sous vide for a period of time.  Our server cracked the egg into the bag of chips.  The egg itself looked raw, but apparently the water bath cooks the yolk and white *just enough*.  We opted for the truffle salt upgrade (duh) which was sprinkled into the bag.  A vigorous shake later, the contents were emptied into a bowl, and we were then able to enjoy these potato crisps evenly and quite perfectly coated with the egg and truffle salt mixture.  I think this is what heaven must taste like.Cocktail list is creative and on point.  I had the octopus which had a nice touch of heat to it.  My wife had the lamb &#34;ribs&#34; which were actually quite tough and not fall-off-the bone.  All in all, we loved this place.

bottlefork-chicago,Steph G.,Af33NzmZ2TGpwEKFxUlrlQ,zVIYSjoXww1ikrSRsjkwrQ,"[Out-of-Towner Review]The Yelp God&#39;s were watching down on us......when we found this spot by happenstance. That&#39;s a tiny little lie, we used Yelp to find local spots and we picked this one, mostly due to proximity to where we were and the odd, freezing Chicago evening weather. We&#39;d been Divvy biking for awhile and had built up a huge appetite. It was our attempt to go with the flow and just find somewhere, instead of looking through my lists of recommendations from various people.So, with spontaneity on our side we walked into the BEST last meal in Chicago we could have asked for. It was dim, but it was bustling. I thought there&#39;d be a wait, but there wasn&#39;t for a party of two. At first she tried to sit us in a very cramped little two-top, but we asked to try somewhere else. We almost got the &#39;Chef&#39;s Table&#39; bar seats, but sadly we ended up just taking two regular bar seats.As we&#39;d been shuffling about, I&#39;d seen the plate of fried chicken, which essentially meant I was having it. It looked amazing, perfectly battered and fried. Finally seated, we grabbed the menus and went to work. The prices are on the higher side, but as a tourist you get used to it. The vibe is hipster, for sure. They don&#39;t even sell soda from the tap, that&#39;s how hipster-fancy-cocktail-making they are.Since Yelp helped me find this place, I checked-in on the app and noticed they give you a free appetizer. Who am I to deny anything free? So, I asked the bartender about it and he brought us our &#34;Bag&#34; of Crisps and Eggs in less than a few minutes. He had explained it to us, which left us skeptical. Here&#39;s how it goes, a brown lunch bag filled with chips that have added vinegar and salt. In a little ramekin is a poached egg, which he swiftly dumped into the bag of chips. Then he shook them violently. The aftermath of random deliciousness in a bowl was pretty amazing, I&#39;m not sure how the flavors blended so well together, but they did. The chips don&#39;t really lose their crispness, but the egg &#39;sauce&#39; adds great flavor. Already winning, and it was free.We didn&#39;t order any adult beverages, which seems to be their thing here. We&#39;d been over indulging all trip and I was ready to have a dinner sans alcohol. J did order a soda and sadly the bartender handed him a glass of ice and the mini Pepsi can. The disappointment of an avid soda drinker was evident across his face. His dreams of endless refills were dashed buy this $2 can of 7.5oz of Pepsi.As for dinner, we ordered to entrees and planned on splitting them both, our normal routine. I had to go with the Wood Grilled Ground Bacon Burger and he went for the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. It should be noted, when we walked in the door the sandwich board sign said &#34;Home of the Famous Bacon Burger,&#34; I knew I was home ;)If you know the burger situation in Chicago (not that I do), then you know about Au Cheval&#39;s burger. Bottlefork&#39;s burger is on the same level as theirs, yes I said it. The Bacon Burger&#39;s flavor profile is much more complex than Au Cheval&#39;s, which is why I say they are in the same category. They both kill it. The flavor of just the burger is amazing. The bun is a heavenly carb bonus. The sauce and other fixings complimented the flavor of everything perfectly. Add some huge crispy fries and dipping sauce, and this is a meal made for a hipster-burger-guzzling patron. They way they plate it is also an added bonus, they use a &#39;green&#39; (re: hippy) wood fork and put a pickle through it on top of the burger. Taste and plating, they win!Who do they think they are feeding with their Buttermilk Fried Chicken? A table of four? For $24 you get your money&#39;s worth. They give you four huge pieces of chicken, battered, seasoned, and fried to perfection. Even the huge chunks of white meat where tender and juicy, no fear of dry chicken with this kitchen. We both didn&#39;t like the gravy, it had a very strong mustard flavor, mixed with a small hint of vinegar. It just wasn&#39;t our thing, but I&#39;m sure you may enjoy it. The griddled biscuit that accompanies this dish, was a huge disk of confusion for taste buds. It was savory, but pancake-esque, but still also like a biscuit. I think after a few bites, we finally gave in to liking it. We probably didn&#39;t talk for a good 20 minutes, while we stuffed our faces of this delicious meal.I have so much more to try on this menu, but sadly it will have to wait until I&#39;m back in the Windy City. The desserts looked tempting, but we already had our sights on stopping one more place after dinner, so we passed. The bartenders/servers were awesome, no complaints about anything, really. Other than really awkward seating, this place should be on everyone&#39;s list, local or tourist!Saying goodbye is already hard, but even more so when this is your last meal...",567,4,2,5,17,8.3519,8.516,4.106,45.377,No

I ordered the Greek omelette. It looked excellent, it really did.  But biting in to it was an unfortunate experience.  It was utterly tasteless.  If a restaurant is going to make eggs the focus, I recommend fresh, farm-raised, organic eggs.  They taste excellent. I can almost guarantee these eggs were not.

So loud that when our server was going over the specials, I couldn&#39;t hear a darn thing he said, except for his announcement that they were out of French Toast, which I was in denial about for the first few minutes because that was the whole reason we came to Bottlefork in the first place.2. Oddly enough, they only serve whole milk. Want a skinny cappuccino? Not going to get it here.3. I&#39;m a big fan of tots and everything potato really, but the tots here were average at best. I LOVE the tots at Velvet Taco and hold all tots to that standard.4. I&#39;m also a big fan of beignets and compare all beignets to the ones at Ramen San.

And the aioli that came with it was amazing. The tots were okay...they weren&#39;t crispy like I enjoy. The pimento cheese on top was a good touch though.I ended up ordering BBQ lamb ribs, as well as the grits n shrooms after our water warned me the lamb ribs weren&#39;t a big amount of food.

My expectations for the food were pretty high, but I had heard the service was not great. The waitress was friendly and generally helpful, but she consistently only refilled one of our coffees (there were 3) and sort of laughed and rolled her eyes when we asked if they had any almond milk (I don&#39;t blame her, but at least wait until you leave the table). We ordered the Bag of Buttermilk &amp; Vanilla Bean Doughnut Holes as an appetizer, and didn&#39;t find them to be anything extraordinary. They were a nice, fluffy texture and served hot, but I didn&#39;t taste any vanilla bean (or any other flavor for that matter). I thought they could have used a bit more cinnamon sugar, although I&#39;m used to New Orleans beignets which probably have too much sugar for most people.The two other people in my party had the Corned Beef Brisket Hash, which they said was pretty good. I had the Greek Omelet which was largely flavorless. It had a generous amount of tzatziki on top, and was served with spinach, tomato, and feta, but somehow the only thing I could taste was the eggs. The seating is really tight, especially at the front of the restaurant.

bottlefork-chicago,kyle t.,4MCemZet-mmfunhSqEdyEQ,#NAME?,"Must make time to write this review!Now for a city that has so many places around to eat finding one that can really stand out seems to be difficult.  Without someone to guide you even using Yelp can seem a little daunting, oh well we found this place.  Booked a table but when we got there instead of waiting we were asked if we wanted to sit in the window by the kitchen, best decision possible.  I highly recommend this place, bar like but overlooking the chefs not a bar.  Everyone behind the counter were inviting, open and seemed truly happy that we were sitting there.  This is a very well run kitchen and it comes across in the food.Everything we ordered was damn near perfect.  Starting with the free app that popped up on Yelp, homemade chips with an egg, yes an egg.  They bring out a bag of homemade chips in a bag and a perfectly poached egg.  The waiter dropped the egg into the bag and closed it, shook it for a minute or so and poured them out on the plate, best chips EVER!  Such a treat to watch them prepare this and the flavor was fantastic, much like the rest of the food.For the main course I was forced to order the burger, not that I wanted one but once I saw it come out of the window I could not say no, even passed up Gnocchi!  The burger was wonderful but as always I was outdone.  CB ordered the PoBoy, rated one of the top 10 in the country.  Now I will say it was amazing but not really worth $25.  It was lobster with fried oysters on top.  The roll was perfect, the oysters were so good but there were not enough of them for $25.  Lobster was fresh and perfectly balanced.  I do hope though that Smack Shack doesn&#39;t catch wind of the pricing here though because their lobster roll is pretty close in taste but half he price.Overall this is one of the best meals we have had in a long time.  Service couldn&#39;t have been better, kitchen and the people in it were great and inviting and overall the ambiance fit.  Great little room and very warm feel to it.

I&#39;m not always a huge fan of these hard-to-cook and hard-to-season veggies, but whatever the chefs do here, they do it more than very well. Sprouts were crispy, grilled, and seasoned with maple-bourbon vinaigrette. Wow, just wow. But that&#39;s not the only wow about this place. There is so much more...I had the pleasure of coming here with a large group of colleagues and a menu made special just for us. The space is long and narrow, but they managed our reservation and seating requirements without a hitch. We had a group of 11, and it was no problem making room for us in the back. I actually enjoyed the intimacy and atmosphere quite a bit. First Course - BitesOur meal consisted of a variety of different course offerings starting with smoked olives. I am a huge olive fan to begin with, so add a hint of orange and coriander and you&#39;ll no doubt appreciate the delicacy. Check-in to the restaurant on your Yelp app and you&#39;ll enjoy the potato chips with a poached egg all shaken up in a bag. Yeah, they are a bit slimy in consistency, but the flavor of vinegar and sea salt mixed in is explosive. Not like I&#39;ve ever had before. Our charcuterie plate was lovely. The mini bread loaves attached together like monkey bread, were hot and fresh. 2nd Course - Salads/GreensYou already know how I feel about the brussel sprouts. The Ensalada Latina salad, though completely packed with a wonderful variety of fresh ingredients, was a bit too spicey for my mild palate (Corn &amp; Black Bean Relish + Butternut Squash Cotija Cheese + Masa Croutons Tomatillo Vinaigrette). I enjoyed the Meditteranean Salad (Eggplant Hummus + Olives + &#34;Saganaki&#34; Cheese Sumac Croutons), but it&#39;s quite filling. I had to stop because I wanted to save room for the main course.Main CourseThe cider braised pork belly served on a sweet potato pur’©e, melted in my mouth. It was soft and flavorful, and mixed in well with the sweet potato. I wish I would have taken more servings of this. Though my colleagues weren&#39;t super into the potato gnocchi with mushroom broth and fried pickled mushrooms, I enjoyed the feeling of the fresh soft dumplings mixed with a mushroom crunch. I&#39;m still not a huge fan of goat cheese, so I could have done without that. I have a soy allergy, and so I was advised to stay away from the grilled octopus. Sadly I enjoy grilled octopus. I am often bored by rotisserie chicken, but here it&#39;s moist and well seasoned and fell off the bone when cutting it. Now that&#39;s the way chicken should be. Also note, the veggies had a lovely crunch to them. Not over cooked.DessertCheers to the homemade creamy soft serve ice cream with the side of apple, caramel and sweet cream custard. Besides being gorgeous in it&#39;s presentation, the custard was so ooey gooey yummy and rich. Overall, the service here was 5+ stars. Our server, in particular, did an amazing job of looking after my soy allergy and gave me the heads up when there was something I should stay away from. I&#39;m am so appreciative. I have no doubt the lunch and brunch are a hit. The music was a tad loud that night, the lighting just a hint too dark (only a hint), and I can only imagine the challenge they must have getting people in and out of there quickly. It&#39;s small with only a few tables, and there was a group of people waiting when I left. It gets crowed quickly. It&#39;s pricey here, which is why I can only give it four stars.

Highlight of brunch was the cast iron skillet French toast.  It&#39;s thick pieces of baguette bread cooked in a skillet with some brown sugar, so it forms a nice caramel coating on the bottom of the bread.  It comes with whipped cream and a berry jam, both are delicious but I think the whipped cream pairs better than the jam.  The Bacon Burger was large in size and in flavor, the ground bacon taking the meat patty to the next level.  They don&#39;t put too much horseradish sauce on it (which I don&#39;t like in general), good since I thought just ketchup would be sufficient.  The burger typically comes with &#34;shoestring fries&#34; which are normal cut everywhere else, but we subbed in the Tots with pimento cheese on top.  it was interesting, but I don&#39;t think Pimento is the right cheese to coat potatoes in, and would much rather have had the fries (this is on me, not a reflection of Bottlefork).

I said I was going to bring a guest, and she kindly made a reservation for me. How could I not? It&#39;s very obvious that Davanti not only looks at their Yelp reviews, but that they truly want their diners to have the ideal experience! Usually other restaurants comment on how they&#39;re sorry and that&#39;s it-- they aren&#39;t committed to correct or improving a dining experience. So, truthfully, this impressed me.I went with my friend a few weeks ago, and just as the first time, I was impressed with the cozy, comfortable, but elegant atmosphere of the restaurant. The restaurant is small plates-style, but I wouldn&#39;t necessarily call them tapas. The small plates are pretty good portions. For my friend and I, we ordered one appetizer plate, one pasta, and one pizza. The waitress was extremely helpful and kind, and great at giving recommendations. The food was phenomenal, the chicken liver pate with toasts and truffle honey, the giant rigatoni, the mushroom, leek and truffle oil pizza...all of it. All the flavors were paired perfectly together, and each and every item we had that night was absolutely scrumptious. I don&#39;t regret a single thing that we ordered that night. I think my favorite though, would have to be the chicken liver pate with toasts and truffle honey, it was such a unique pairing but absolutely delicious. The prices are a little on the higher end, but all the ingredients are quite high quality and of the freshest taste.

I think the drink was composed like an Old Fashioned but with the additional of an Italian amaro - it was fine but unmemorable and a little weak. The lemon curd that came with the ricotta pancakes was lovely and tangy-sweet but the pancakes themselves could have used some more air in the mix. The sausage side dish featured a wonderfully snappy casing and roasted grapes that worked well to keep things fresh on the palate. The brown butter brownie was very satisfying, served warm with lots of rich sweet and nutty flavors.

I love going to restaurants as a large group, because then we can order so many dishes and try different things! Here is what we ordered, in no particular order:Truffle Egg Toast with fontina and asparagus: wow, this is toast on crack. I love truffle, I love eggs, and I love toast! This is definitely something you should try, if you haven&#39;t already!Escarole salad served with gala apple, pecorino dolce, celery and hazelnuts. I can&#39;t say this is the best salad I&#39;ve ever had, but it was a great way to complement the rest of the meal, which was all protein, sauce, and savory-ness.Board: Mascarpone polenta plus the ragu of the day, which was a ragu sauce made with sausage. For those of you who may not know, traditional ragu is a tomato based sauce and is the definition of slow cooking. It&#39;s usually a thick, hearty pasta sauce, made with at least one kind of meat, that&#39;s simmered for hours until the meat is tender and the sauce is rich and savory. I liked the sausage, but I&#39;m a total bolognese girl. I hope I can come again when they have a bolognese type of ragu that day.Pappardelle e cinghiale is a pasta made from hand cut pappardelle with braised boar, pistachio, sage, and pecorino crotonese. This is one of my favorite pasta dishes, and I can eat it all day!!~ Loved the quality of the noodles, I kept going back in for seconds and thirds and fourths.Cacio e pepe is a very simple but delicious dish of spaghetti noodles with pecorino and black pepper. Simplicity at its best.Polpo con rafono is seared octopus with warm fingerling potato salad, marcona almonds, finocchiona, and horseradish aioli. I only had a bite of this, but that bite was amazing! It&#39;s actually quite easy to share as long as you make bite-sized cuts.Ossobuco di maiale: braised pork shank, cannellini beans, roasted mushroom and roasted scallion oil. Wow this is a savory, hearty dish. You only need to order one for the table, it&#39;s big!Pizza della terra: wild mushroom, braised leeks, taleggio and truffle oil. This was my favorite pizza, you can really taste the truffle oil and the mushrooms were so savory and umami.Pizza con prosciutto e rucola: prosciutto di parma, fresh mozzarella, fontina and arugula. You can never go wrong with a classic prosciutto and arugula pizza, they pair well together.And finally, we had an order of the Brussels sprouts with pancetta, calabrian and saba...I love brussels sprouts and they make this dish so well here! Pancetta is like bacon, so everything is good with bacon right?Also, here are some specials that they have (by day):Monday | 30% off for Industry EmployeesTuesday | Davanti burger + Peroni ... $14 5pm-9pmWednesday | 25% off wines by the bottle (excludes house pours) 5pm-9pmFriday | Our Whim!

It was a delicious go-to place for us and up until Sun 10/30/16, I have only ever had fabulous food and awesome service here. Then, I had the disappointment of being waited on by Matt for our Sunday brunch meal. I brought in 2 friends visiting from Florida and I was so embarrassed that we had such an ignorant, argumentative and useless server.  We tried on multiple attempts to get his attention because we needed something and he pretended to not hear us.  He was a stubborn, petulant child that had to have his way and he totally had us on IGNORE!  The problem came when we got our bill and I noticed we were charged for a soda which we never received and $8 for three Bloody Mary drinks which we saw advertised for $6 according to a sign posted by the front entrance.  He promptly said to me, &#34;The Bloody Mary&#39;s are $8.  Mimosas are $6&#34;.  At that point, I got up and asked him to follow me to the sign posted by your front door and all the way up to the front of your restaurant, Matt adamantly argued and argued with me about the cost of these drinks and says to me, &#34;Trust me, I work every Sunday brunch every weekend and the price for Bloody Mary&#39;s is $8.  Mimosas are $6!&#34;   I showed him the sign and showed him what I read and then asked, &#34;From looking at that sign, it looks like $6 to me&#34;.  He replied, &#34;No it doesn&#39;t!!  It&#39;s $8&#34;.  I then asked his name and he, hesitantly told me that his name was &#34;Matt&#34;.  As we walked back into the full restaurant, I asked him, &#34;Do you always argue with your customers in this fashion?&#34;     He brings over a revised bill and had removed the forgotten soda but never changed the price of our Bloody Mary drinks.  He had completely ignored my protest and refused to change the price of the drinks.  We left him $5 on a $100 check, something I rarely do because I typically your servers generously (20-25% on average) because they are normally fantastic. As I was leaving the restaurant, Matt decides to follow me out and continues to argue with me about the price of the Bloody Mary.  I put my hand up and told him to &#34;talk to the hand&#34; because he was now harassing me.  I found your manager Deana (sp?) on the phone and she quickly hung up when I explained I needed to speak to her about her server, Matt.  I reiterated the entire situation and she was mortified.  She was also very apologetic about his behavior, which I appreciated.  I showed Deana the sign in question by your front door and she agreed that she could see how it was misleading the way it was written.  She then offered me a gift card for all of our troubles and I explained that I didn&#39;t bring this to her attention because I wanted something for free.  I further explained that I am a very loyal and long-time customer of your restaurant and further stated that someone with Matt&#39;s poor customer service skills, bad attitude and rude demeanor should not be in the service industry because as far as I&#39;m concerned, arguing with a customer in a busy restaurant is never accepted.  I think saw Matt over by your kitchen area complaining about me to your kitchen staff.  NOT ACCEPTABLE in my opinion.  Deana again offered the gift card to me.  It was a nice gesture but,  I refused it.  I did explain to Deana that I am probably the worse customer to upset because I do leave reviews everywhere (OpenTable, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Facebook, etc..) and I will be leaving my honest experience on those sites about what happened. I use to be a bartender and server in my 20&#39;s (I am not mid-50&#39;s) so I am fully aware of good customer service.

It was a restaurant we had remembered fondly going to when we had lived in the neighborhood before we were married. Turns out to be even better than we remembered.Food:Split a bottle of moderately priced ros’© (for restaurant price) and cheese plate of three cheeses to start. Then had a light salad and truffle egg toast, which were both excellent. The truffle egg toast is pretty unique, I&#39;ve not seen or tasted anything like it anywhere else. Salad greens were fresh and not overdressed. Then we split a half chicken which came with fresh lettuce and what I think was real Caesar dressing- chicken was juicy and flavorful, the chili paste sauce didn&#39;t really have a kick to it like advertised but was so delicious that we didn&#39;t care. Finished up with some kind of blondie/gelato combo that was everything I wanted a dessert to be- rich but not too sweet, great blend of flavors, appropriate portion.Service:Service was great! Had both a server, Ron, and a busser whose name I didn&#39;t catch but was also very attentive with water and plate clearing. Ron was the best- he would be a ghost when we didn&#39;t need anything and right when we were about to look for him he&#39;d appear. He came and poured wine at all the right times and was just the right amount of attentive. Charming personality, never missed a beat, not pushy at all. We would be friends with him if we were cool enough.Ambience:Pretty quiet, but I guess that&#39;s typical of Monday nights. Beautiful interior with a wall of wine in the back and lovely decor throughout. Appropriate lighting. Tables were not too close together. Music was odd but my wife and I found it amusing, we remember hearing Talking Heads at one point and some nineties songs, as well as some dance music. It wasn&#39;t loud enough to be distracting, though, and we easily had good conversation throughout the evening.

I called a few weeks ago and asked if they took reservations for large groups, to which they said yes but suggested we go with a pre-set menu for our group of 12. I worried that this might not sit well with the rest of my group, since it was also a set price, and that the quality of the food might be jeopardized, but I could not have been more wrong. BEST suggestion ever. And here&#39;s why: 1)We went with their cheapest per person menu and were given SO much food, even the guys in our group were happily stuffed by the end of the meal. 2) The food was ready as soon as we sat down at our table. I&#39;m not kidding--as soon as we sat down, they brought out the appetizers. And each course after that was ready to go as soon as we were ready for it, too.3) EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. From the starters to the dessert, everything was absolutely incredible. We started with bruschetta, which was made with seasonal vegetables instead of your generic tomato mix, and it was so good. We also had the mason jar of ricotta with honey--YUM.  For the second course, I chose the prosciutto pizza and it was absolutely lovely. And for our entrees, I chose the spaghetti carbonara, rigatoni wth Italian sausage, and pork shoulder polenta. OMG THE PORK SHOULDER POLENTA!!! I will remember it forever. And last but not least, a plate of their reputable Blondie bars--to die for. 4) From our wonderful waitress, to the very nice and considerate gentlemen who helped her, and last but not least Dina, everyone who worked with us at Davanti Enoteca was kind and so considerate. After sitting and enjoying our meal for 2.5 hours (maybe more), Dina came over and asked if we wouldn&#39;t mind moving to the bar. She felt SO bad about having to move us (there were other people waiting for our table) that she sent us off with a free bottle of wine. Totally not necessary, since we were paid and motivating to leave anyway, but just exemplified the consideration they have there for their guests.Five stars all around and hope to be back soon!!",242,5,2,5,11,4.3974,3.3030000000000004,0.806,16.891000000000002,No

He was knowledgable and had suggestions but certainly harried. On to the food that we shared:Fontina and egg toast with asparagus was delectable. Beet salad which I always go with was average, the burger was huge and flavorful, also split 3 ways with shoestring potatoes, the chop grilled with peaches was rather fatty, with no more than 3 thin slices of clean meat. A shared order of pasta with sausage that was also flavorful. Also a side of corn with mushrooms, which I thought the corn on its own would be better, and I like mushrooms. We shared the strawberry tart along with chocolate pistachio cake, which was more like a hard fudge. I wouldn&#39;t recommend either and just go with gelato next time. It was a mixed bag this time, and usually they&#39;re better. Great place for sharing and not your typical Italian.

When we got there, parking seemed to be way easier and generally the area wasn&#39;t as busy, which was good. Atmosphere: This place had a real rustic feel to it. It seemed cozier than some of the trendier Italian spots in the city and had kind of a wooden decor theme going on. I liked it.  Food: I&#39;ve never been to any of their locations before, so I just let her take the lead on the ordering.Polenta / ragu of the day - This dish was pretty cool because they assemble it in front of you at the table. Our server brought out a wooden board and then spread the polenta on it. Then he layered the ragu on top of it. The ragu of the day when we went was veal meatball. I thought it was pretty good. The polenta added a nice creamy texture and served as good base for each bite. The ragu had plenty of meat but I couldn&#39;t really taste a huge difference with veal meatballs over regular beef ones. I heard the pork shoulder ragu was even better. Crispy pork belly - Basically massive strips of gourmet bacon. These were thick cut and had an awesome crispy outside. Every bite started with a nice crunch and then you just hit a layer of melt in your mouth fattiness. I just wished it was a bigger serving. I could&#39;ve eaten plates and plates of that stuff. Uni pasta - Apparently this is main reason she even chose this place for dinner...it&#39;s pretty much her go to dish. I was a little skeptical since I&#39;m honestly not even a huge fan of seafood to begin with but damn it was pretty delicious. It&#39;s actually a really simple dish. It just looked like a plate of noodles at first, but once I took a bite I was surprised at the flavors that jumped out at me. The noodles were very al dente and from a texture standpoint it wasn&#39;t very saucy at all. But that sea urchin sauce that cooked into the noodles was both rich and bold, without having an overwhelming fishy taste.

We were seated right away and it looks like there were still empty tables available at that time. The restaurant itself is really cute, exactly what I would expect from a highly acclaimed Italian restaurant in Little Italy. We had a server in-training, so service was a bit slow throughout the meal. We started with a glass of wine and a Peroni. The wine by the glass menu was a bit expensive for us (recent college grads) so we stuck with the cheapest options.Davanti does small plates, so keep that in mind when you order. My gf and I did the gnocchi, the tagliatelle and the Pizza D.O.C. (a margarita pizza). The pizza came first and it was the perfect dish to start with. Warm and fresh with a crisp, thin crust. When we finished that the gnocchi came out. It was SO good but the dish was SO small. It might have been the best gnocchi dish I&#39;ve ever had but we probably paid $2/gnocchi. That&#39;s a bit much in my mind. The tagliatelle was a slightly bigger dish and was also very good.This is a great restaurant! I can&#39;t give it 5 stars this time around because the service was a bit slow and the dishes are really expensive for being so small.

House made salami is very flavorful and not salty.2. Veal meatball-Unlike the dry beefy meatball everywhere else, the veal meatball is one of the best meatball I ever had. Great texture- has a bite to it but very moist and big! 3. Warm kale salad is perfect- warm vinaigrette dressing just enough to warm the kale without wilting it. Top with orange &amp; grapefruit slices, pecan and salty pancetta, it&#39;s literally perfect.4. Gigantic spinach ravioli (yes, only one large in the plate) has great flavor- perfect blend of spinach &amp; ricotta cheese filling.

Pappardelle with pork rugu- house made pappardelle had great texture cooked perfectly- al dente with flavorful sauce. 6. Osso Bucco with cannellini beans is also fabulous! Meat is falling apart by fork and beans maintain perfect texture not overcooked.7. Chocolate Gelato has creamy texture and not overly sweet, perfect for the chocolate lover.8.

I loved the exposed brick bar and the old timey decoration but I wasn&#39;t impressed that all the seating in the front was high tops. It brought down the classiness and made it more of a bar feel which wasn&#39;t what I was hoping for. The wait staff and hostess were very friendly and attentive which was great. Our water glasses were never empty and our dishes continuously cleared. I should also note that I was impressed at how the food was brought out, 1 dish at a time, so we could really appreciate each dish without feeling rushed to get to the next one. Here&#39;s a breakdown on the food:1. Ricotta &amp; Honey - holy cow. Personally, I&#39;m not a huge fan of honey or anything sickeningly sweet. However, this was by far one of the best appetizers I think I&#39;ve ever had. The honey comb was so fresh, the ricotta was nicely seasoned with salt and pepper and the bread was fantastically crunchy. I&#39;d give 10 stars just for this appetizer - you have to try it.2. Burrata - generally, I&#39;m a fan of all things caprese related. Especially when there is Burrata. This came with roasted tomatoes and a basil pesto. It was pretty good but unfortunately it came out after the ricotta &amp; honey and we were so blown away by that dish that this one paled in comparison. But it was still good and worth a try.3. Rigatoni Pomodori - this was good but as a warning, it comes with enormous chunks of onion in it. I absolutely hate onions and wish I had know before I ordered. Also, the waiter got a little happy with the cheese and I ended up with a mound of Parmesan on top. Still, worth ordering again but next time I&#39;ll specify no onions.4. Gnocchi with Lamb Ragu - most interesting gnocchi we ever tried. Typically I&#39;d expect almost dumplingesque potato pillows but instead we got little cakes of potato more similar to a mashed potato cake. It was topped with lamb meat that was very tender but needed more tomato sauce in my opinion.5. Strawberry Rhubarb Sorbetti - after such rich courses we opted for a lighter Sorbetti. I&#39;m not sure where the rhubarb came in - this just tasted like fresh strawberry sorbet to us. A bit sweet for my liking but clearly fresh and delectably creamy.All in all, the food was good, waiters were helpful, atmosphere was a bit loud and confused, valet parking was available, and everything was reasonably priced. I will definitely go back for that ricotta &amp; honey!",276,4,4,5,112,6.9645,5.094,1.6360000000000001,21.266999999999996,No

I had a completely different vision before I walked in so I was blown away.  My boyfriend and I went for dinner. Atmosphere:  The space is beautiful.  We sat at a table in the bar.  The decor was gorgeous with brick archways, walls made of old wine cases, rustic lighting.... I could go on for hours about it.Service:  Our waiter (who I believe to also be the bartender) could not have been more hospitable.  He promptly brought us waters and menus (one of my biggest pet peeves is sitting and waiting to be greeted upon being seated).  He guided us through the menu, wine lists and daily specials and made a couple recommendations.  He was quick to change plates, fill water and wine, bring entrees and remove items no longer needed.  He was also social and funny.  Felt like we were being served by a friend (and this goes for everyone that helped during service and seating).Food:  I had been craving good pasta and this hit the spot.  We tried the bruchetta special ($5 on Sunday) which included squash.  I hadn&#39;t had anything like it and it was a refreshing spin on standard bruchetta.  It was served atop 4 pieces of bread.  Next we tried the warm kale salad (Kale, Guanciale, Orange, Pecans, Pecorino).  This was my least favorite dish as it was a little salty from the Guanciale and I didn&#39;t care for the temperature of it but it was still very enjoyable.  We ordered 3 pasta dishes (the raviolo, rigatoni and cacio e pepe).  We asked that all the dishes be served &#34;al dente&#34; which our server was a little confused by (surprising) but they still hit it on the head.  The Raviolo is stuffed with spinach and covered in parm and olive oil.  This is only one piece but large enough to split between two people (although you won&#39;t want to).  This was my favorite dish of the night.  Next, the cacio e pepe was a little over cooked to our liking but the pecorino was perfectly melted and creamy.  If the pasta was cooked a little less this would have been my favorite dish.  The Rigatoni was a last minute addition since I was craving some red sauce and I&#39;m so glad we did!  The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sausage was very flavorful.  We added parm to the top and I ate it in minutes.  The sauce was simple and was just enough.  Wine:  They offer 5 and 8 oz pours and bottles.  Their wine list is expansive and everything is reasonably priced.  We enjoyed a bottle of the Asti.  We intended to enjoy a little and take the rest home, but it was so good we finished it all at dinner.  Unfortunately we were too stuffed for dessert but we were given free limoncello which was some of the best I&#39;ve had.

Italian happens to be my favorite cuisine, and I often abhor paying substantial coin for food I believe I can make at home. Luckily for me, Davanti offers dishes not readily cookable in my kitchen, and provides a worthy experience for my dollars.The restaurant set-up is homey, bustling, and charming. I immediately compared it to an Italian version of Austin&#39;s excellent Barley Swine. Both bar and staff service is fantastic and friendly. The only complaint I&#39;ve had is that both times we came with reservations, and both times we endured a short wait at the bar. That&#39;s not unreasonable for a restaurant as small and popular as Davanti, but it&#39;s still grating.But you don&#39;t care about that. You care about the food. Fair enough. Her dish is the impeccably simple yet impeccably perfect ricotta and local honey comb. It is what it is: toasted, delicious bread smearable with smooth and subtle ricotta, accented with a speck of honey to add additional sweetness and stickiness to your tongue. The dish came very approved by our visiting friends, who declared it the winner of the weekend.My pick is the riccio de mare e granchio: also simple, also perfect. It&#39;s linguine in a tomato-butter sauce, only the butter is melted down sea urchin. If that doesn&#39;t make you drool, we can&#39;t be friends. Frankly, I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m friends with the friends I brought, since they turned their noses when I offered up a sea urchin pasta. We weren&#39;t that close, anyway. Small bits of crab are but accoutrement to the dish.Everything else on the menu is, frankly, fantastic. And worth mentioning. The truffled egg toast is amazing, as is the focaccia special. And if your eyes bug about paying $16 for focaccia bread, I&#39;ll alleviate your fears now: it&#39;s worth it. Pizza is good. Pasta is good. A surprisingly spicy and wickedly sauced half-chicken is dang good. Everything is good.

Both were delicious dishes that I would definitely order again. The ricotta was creamy perfection when mixed with the honey comb and spread on top of a warm slice of Tuscan toast and the truffle toast-well, it&#39;s truffle, cheese, toast so thick you need a steak knife, and perfectly runny egg yolks...need I say more?Next up were our pasta dishes and they definitely did not disappoint. Their Cacio e Pepe is officially one of my top Italian dishes off all-time...no joke. It is a simple dish but perfect in every way. We also had a pappardelle pasta with ham and a tomato sauce that was full of flavor, surprisingly light, and just straight up good pasta.There were definitely more dishes that we would have loved to try but we decided to save those for another visit because we needed just a little room for dessert.

Service was great and the food was outstanding!  We had reservations and were seated immediately when we arrived.  My family brought our own bottle of wine and Davanti does charge a $25 corkage fee, so please take note of that if you plan to bring your own.  Davanti is tapas style where most dishes are smaller and meant to be shared. Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu and suggested we order 5-6 dishes for the 4 of us.  Since we are gluttons, we definitely ordered way too much but my family prefers to have leftovers than be hungry!  We tried the truffle egg toast, D.O.C. pizza, crispy pork belly + mostarda, maiale e ricotta gnudi, paccheri con salsiccia e pomodori al forno, and the mascarpone polenta + ragu of the day.  Everything was delicious but my favorites of the night were the pork belly and the polenta + ragu dishes.  The pork belly was crisp on top and melt in your mouth fatty on the bottom.  MMMMMMMM. The polenta resembled mashed potatoes in consistency and lacked flavor but that&#39;s what the ragu was for.  The meatballs in the ragu were delish and tender.  I could pass on the gnudi (pronounced nudie and yes, we all were immature and kept repeating it throughout the night hahahah) the next time since it didn&#39;t stand out to me.  The pizza was yummy and actual Italian pizza, not what Americans think of when we say pizza.  It was thin and not greasy with a nice crisp crust but still chewy at the same time.  The D.O.C pizza was topped with fresh mozzarella and basil and wasn&#39;t too saucy which was refreshing.  I enjoyed the truffle egg toast and was very pleased that it had a strong truffle flavor.  The d’©cor of Davanti is very welcoming with lots of dark wood and their large variety of wine on display on the back shelves.

They recently renovated and even put in a salad bar for all of the healthy lunch goers. Good idea, but if you are going to MANNY&#39;s do yourself a favor and get a huge sandwich. Other than the amazing food, MANNY&#39;s is a special family ran restaurant. The Brothers have taken over management and do a fantastic job. There is an even a celebrity deli man, GENO. He&#39;s the coolest and been rocking his classic mustache since 85&#39;. I recently moved even closer to MANNY&#39;s which means I will be packing on a few pastrami pounds.",133,5,2,4,11,3.1172,1.944,0.683,13.373000000000001,No

If you&#39;re a first-timer, here&#39;s how it works: Manny&#39;s is really 3 restaurants in one plus a bakery, set up cafeteria style. First, stop on your way in to read the sign showing the day&#39;s specials, then pick up tray and utensils and join the line. The first station is a steam table with entrees and sides. Beyond that is the deli--so if you&#39;re hankering for a foot-tall sandwich, skip the front and move half-way down to the deli station. Your sandwich will be hand made, and adorned with pickle or potato pancake if you wish. In between, you can pick up soup--from matzoh ball (highly recommended) to borscht (ditto) to navy bean, they are all delicious. Beyond the deli is the never busy salad section (too healthy for most), where someone will make your salad, or you can pick up sides like cole slaw or bean salad. Want a scoop of chopped liver (and who doesn&#39;t?), get it here. At the very end of the line, beverages, and after the 90 degree left turn, desserts. Don&#39;t reach for your wallet now--the mock cashier will give you a check, but you don&#39;t pay until you are ready to leave, in front. There you will find packaged baked goods to take home and continue noshing. Got all that? What could be simpler. The food can be pretty good. To eat well, order smart. Some items dry out on a steam table, like chicken or fish, others get better as they continue to slowly cook, like stews or beef short ribs. Order the latter. Can&#39;t go wrong with the deli, and even the turkey pastrami has its place in your sandwich. The sweet noodle kugel is the best ever! I am NOT a fan of the potato pancakes--the ones here are gummy hockey pucks. I prefer latkes that are light, crispy and just fried; the ones here are lukewarm, heavy, and ancient. For dessert I often indulge in a frosted apple slice--where can you get those anymore?I&#39;ll make a long story short: Long live Manny&#39;s!",253,5,1,5,-8,5.7752,3.5020000000000002,0.376,22.120999999999995,No

Dan Raskin is attentive, thorough, accommodating and courteous during the entire planning process. He is also on site during the party to make sure everything is okay. Old school service at it&#39;s best.We were just at Manny&#39;s to see the new renovations and they are fabulous. Clearly a lot of thoughtful planning went into the upgrade to carry on the classic feel of an old time deli. The new bakery/deli portion is wonderful and already a Sunday favorite in our house.

It has been my favorite deli since then.Pastrami and corned beef on an onion roll with a potato latke and side of applesauce is where its at!This has been my only sandwich choice since 2001. I have always wanted to try other menu items but my god that sandwich is so damned good I just cannot bring myself to eating anything else. I did in the last year branch out to a side of mac n cheese and it too is amazing. Creamy, cheesy hot and delicious!Lets talk about portions because this plate is expensive compared to what you can get elsewhere but again lets think about what your getting and the quality is second to none!Picture a 9 inch dinner plate that is smothered in food.

I had been to one other deli here in Chicago, Eleven City Diner.  I absolutely love delis, they remind me of a home away from home, having grown up in the northeast in a Jewish household, and my grandfather having been a butcher and owning his own very popular deli back in the day in Connecticut.  Maybe I&#39;m just a delicatessen snob.  It was only about 30 minutes before closing time on a weeknight, but I had the craving!  Walking in, it reminds you of the old school deli (like Katz&#39;s in NY).  I was so excited and ready to feel nostalgic.  We pick up our trays like old school cafeteria style (very cool), and I look at the spread in front of me.  I was very unsure what to think, except that it was almost closing time?  The food didn&#39;t look all that appealing, but I care more about the taste at this point.  Matzoh ball soup (the matzoh balls had a yellowed top, which I can only guess is because they&#39;ve been sitting there untouched and unstirred).

It was not the fluffy flavorful ball I&#39;m used to when grandma or mom makes it.  It needed a bit of salt.  The broth was good.  The knish was ice cold.  The gravy was gelatinous.  I had them reheat it for me.  Apparently they just leave the knishes in a tray, but there is no heating mechanism stated the counter clerk.  The knish was soft, but I&#39;m used to layers of delicate flaky pastry outside, this was just soft and had a rather bland meat filling.  The gravy just wasn&#39;t what I was expecting.  The spicy mustard made it more edible.  Finally, the ultimate test, the corned beef!  Well, maybe I&#39;m just a butchers grand daughter, but the meat was thinly sliced and seriously dry.  It was very fatty, and very disappointing.  I&#39;m guessing that the food is much better when its made earlier in the day and not sitting around all day/ night.

There&#39;s a board that displays all the daily specials.  It&#39;s cozy and inviting on the inside.  You can grab a tray and walk down the counter to see the food offerings.  Besides their signature Rueben, they have other sandwiches and hot meals (e.g. stuffed peppers).   After you get to the end of the line, you get the bill for your food but you don&#39;t pay for it until you exit through their mini store.So, back to this $14 Rueben - it was good, jam packed with meat and good flavoring, but I don&#39;t think anything can top the Reubenesque from Boloney&#39;s for me, especially for half the price.  The soup with Matzo ball was good and the pecan pie was decent.  But the Rueben with the $14 price tag is hefty for a sandwich.  That&#39;s not how I roll.  Roll, get it?

Word out in the medical district is that this is the go to place for tacos and I&#39;m glad I took the advice. Each taco is about 2.50, unless you opt for the more expensive shrimp or fish at 3.25 a piece. Going the money saving route, I decided on a steak, chicken, and al pastor.When I unwrapped my food, there was an explosion of meat chunks overflowing out of the taco shell. The steak was especially impressive, nothing like the small chewy bits of fatty steak you will find at lesser taco joints. The meat is all grilled to perfection, and 3 tacos makes a satisfying meal. Also, the salsas accompanying the tacos come with good heat but aren&#39;t overly spicy.I&#39;m so happy I found this place! It definitely beats most taco joints I&#39;ve tried, even the more notable ones in little village and wicker park. If you like meat and flavor, Chilango is your jam.

The chicken and steak were standard but well done. The fish taco was different from others in the city. Nice cabbage topping with a sweeter sauce. Another well done take. The chips and guac were enjoyed too. Hard to mess up guac. The real kicker in all of this were the sauces. Pretty unique tasting and delicious to put on top of chips and tacos.

First of all I don&#39;t live anywhere near Taylor street, but I had a taste for Mexican food and this was one of the restaurants I bookmarked on Yelp.  I made a trip down here to try their food.  This still is part of the old Italian neighborhood, but the gentrification of the neighborhood with UIC and Medical Center/Rush students, teachers and faculty has brought a lot of new business into this area since my days @ UIC.  First of all the parking is very limited.  The spaces consist of metered, resident parking or tow zones.  I&#39;m told this isn&#39;t bad because it&#39;s Sunday, but I still had to park 1 block away.  I decided to try 3 different tacos to try and get a flavor for different items on the menu, none of which was very good.  The chicken w/red cabbage?  Really flavorless and very dry.  The Steak w/cilantro &amp; onions very dry not much flavor.  Finally the Pork w/cilantro &amp; onions. A little more taste, but the pork was dry &amp; chewy.  They gave me 3 small containers, 1 of each of  a got red sauce, a green sauce and one that looked like 1000 island.  These sauces helped with the flavor on the tacos, but the serving size was so small it wasn&#39;t enough sauce for the 3 tacosNeedless to say I probably won&#39;t be going back there especially when there are so many great Mexican restaurants all over the city with easier parking.",158,2,2,1,19,0.4987000000000001,0.526,0.6599999999999999,13.814,No

I do think they are worth their price.I ordered a chori-cheese empanada, and the chorizo definitely had a different flavor than I&#39;m used to, but I wouldn&#39;t say it was bad.The tortilla soup was creamy and full of wonderful texture with the veggies and crunchy tortilla chips stacked on top.The elote however was not the typical street-corn I was craving for which is what I was disappointed in most. It was oddly sweet and too wet. I ordered a cup and the corn was drowned in a thin mayo sauce.The horchata also had a slight coconut flavor and not what the typical horchata found at small taco places tastes like.I am giving this place 4 stars however because the restaurant is clean, the service was incredibly nice as well. My bf and I sat down after ordering and one of the waiter&#39;s brought the horchata to our table and asked if it was our first time there. After having explained it was our first visit, he explained the three different salsa options which range from sweet to spicy. They are cream-based salsas and have unique flavors.The best dish I had would be the empanadas and they have about 10 different options of empanadas which is great!Hilarious Spanish wall quotes btw!

I was absolutely #blessed to have Genevieve answer my phone call and help me figure out what my options were--I explained the situation and within about 10 minutes, Genevieve created a customized beer and bacon off-menu experience especially for my dad and me.  Could it get any better than top-notch customer service?!  I didn&#39;t think it could, but I was so wrong!On the day of our reservation, my dad and I walked in, and were greeted by Miss Genevieve (seriously, if you just want to chat with a super friendly and awesome person, go find her!) who showed us to our table and explained that they&#39;d be bringing out bacon boards along with a 5-oz beer tasting for each type of bacon--jowl, peppercorn, pig butt (I don&#39;t remember what this one was called exactly, but that&#39;s the jist), and brown sugar.  This isn&#39;t a regular menu offering, as they typically do events, but like I said, Genevieve is a saint.  Throughout the experience, our server, Ginny (super awesome gal!!) brought out small glasses of beer, explained the what/why of the pairing and answered any questions we had.  Incredible afternoon, and my dad LOVED it.As for the food and beer itself--amazing.  Hearty portions, super flavorful, and the pairings were PERFECT.  I am salivating for the brown sugar bacon again!If you want excellent customer service from start to finish, look no further than Kaiser Tiger--I still can&#39;t believe the treatment we received from that very first phone call up until the moment we closed out.

You make 1 inch slices of the beef just like a meatloaf, then lay it on top of a potato bun garnished with lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheese or just eat it like a good ol&#39; steak dinner.

Wings were small and typical of your cheap sports bar fare. I got the beer and bacon sausage, which was actually quite tasty even though the bacon surrounding the sausage was soggy. Hubby got the Kaiser board and it was really good too - especially the mustards. The beer list is respectable, but the beer is served in plastic cups. As is the water. We also had a dirty napkin propping up our table and a host of old food beneath our feet. Our server very obviously did not want to be there.  The crowd here was young and drunk.

So my counting is a bit off as that is 5 words but if this review wasn&#39;t posted under the Kaiser Tiger, that first word should be a dead giveaway as to where I was for where else in Chicago can you do curling?And given I was there on a snowy Monday night, the curling teams were in rare form, with matching hats, snow shovels to clear the courts (is that what you call them?) and a bonfire in a barrel to try to warm the frigid fingers.  And I am quite sure in the warmer months, this space is probably one of the best beer gardens in the city!And that Bomb?  Not a drink.  But a ginormous mound of beef, pork and spicy bacon that serves 7-8 &#34;Vikings&#34; (according to the menu) takes 45 minutes to cook, and comes to the table looking like the biggest meatloaf you have ever eaten with all the rolls and cheese and fixings that you can imagine as well as a heaping mound of fries.  The guys in our group loved it.  I thought it was just okay but then meatloaf isn&#39;t really my thing.  But the $70 price point is pretty reasonable if you have a big group!And there was certainly enough beer on the lists for even the most picky brewmaster to find something to spark him.  And the wine list still has some good choices on it as well.If you want to watch your favorite game, ask, as they don&#39;t always have the TV&#39;s on, but they will do their best to accommodate your requests.And my favorite part?  The playlist.  I have no idea who&#39;s music they are using but song after song came up and had us singing along and commenting on how great the music was.This is the old Tasting Room space but gone is the liquor store next door but they did keep the beautiful upstairs space which is perfect still for your private function.  If you haven&#39;t been up thee, the windows with the views of the city alone are worth the rental fees.My guy friends love this place. Is it the curling?  The sausage intensive menu?  The beer?

A welcome stop on Randolph at the edge of Union Park, Kaiser Tiger offers a good craft beer list, an outdoor patio of note, and the beginnings of what could be a good menu. Stopped in here before one of the recent U2 concerts at the UC, this place was busy early! Door staff is friendly, and found me at the bar once the rest of my party had shown up, to seat us quickly.I like the layout of Kaiser, it works! But even packed with old U2 fans, Kaiser is hitting record decibel levels between music and crowd noise, and that can be a hindrance to having a conversation with someone seated right across from you. Our server was on point! Service here is the tops. And so are the hops! Kaiser has a nice craft beer list, to go with their menu, and sausage program. (Yes, I think someone at Kaiser described it as their &#34;sausage program&#34;!).We shared (copied from their website):Free Range Bison- Topped with house-made chow-chow (root vegetable slaw) and cilantro mustard.Chicken Muchacho- Chicken jalape’±o tequila sausage topped with queso fresco and cilantro mustard on a crusty roll.The Chicken Muchacho won this Lucha Libre match, as the Bison was just unremarkable. The Muchacho didn&#39;t win out by much, either. Hopefully they can improve their sausages with more balanced yet inventive offerings, like the Bangers at Aberdeen Tap. We shared a small side of Belgian Fries, and you can choose two dipping sauces from Irish Curry, Cajun Remoulade, Bleu Cheese Bacon Walnut, Curry Ketchup, Garlic Aioli, Chipotle Mayo or Honey Dijon.

This bar/restaurant is my favorite place to go before a Hawks or Bulls game at the UC for a myriad of reasons... First of all the ambiance at Kaiser is spot on. The bar is huge, very welcoming, and I&#39;ve never had difficulty grabbing a table before heading to the UC. Games and things to do run abound at this spot with curling and bocce ball (season dependent) on their huge patio and tons of different options inside.When it comes to food and beverage Kaiser Tiger doesn&#39;t mess around. I&#39;ve tried a lot of their menu items over various visits and standouts have to be their french fries, bacon wrapped dates, and soft pretzel. If you&#39;re looking to get a good sample in I&#39;d highly recommend the Kaiser Board which comes with Sausage, a Soft Pretzel, Sauerkraut, and German Potato Salad. It&#39;s definitely enough for two or three to share and is a great way to try some of the menu&#39;s highlights. They also have a huge beer list and a few signature cocktails that fit right in with the restaurant&#39;s theme. I&#39;ve tried both the gin and vodka radlers and both were delicious! If you&#39;re on Randolph Street looking for something a little more casual than what inhabits restaurant row or heading to the UC - Kaiser Tiger is the stop for you!",147,4,1,5,5,4.3678,1.7710000000000001,0.082,9.147,No

Upon arriving, the entire staff was immediately rude to us and demanded that we not sit at some of the &#34;reserved tables&#34; outside, which they initially told us it was completely open seating outside. Then, my boyfriend had given the bar his credit card to keep his tab open. Maybe half an hour goes by and we go in to get another beer...the bar couldn&#39;t find his card. Looked around for it for an hour and a half before finally telling us they had completely lost it, BUT they assured us that she didn&#39;t give it to anybody by mistake. We would have left after this had they not agreed to comp our drinks, so we stayed around for a few more. Right before leaving, I grabbed one french fry out of a take home box I had from brunch that morning, before I could even chew a waitress popped out of the woodworks and started yelling at me for bringing outside food in and that what I was doing was against health code.

I also the Schlafly Christmas Ale which was surprisingly amazing!!! Wasnt as sweet as it sounds and gave me a nice buzz @ 8%. For food I went with the popular Bomb Sandwich which puts you in the mindset of meatloaf sandwich once you bite into it.The sandwich includes Bomb (beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave) pepperjack cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions and housemade BBQ sauce on a bun. Pretty good sandwich actually and you have the option of getting the whole bomb as well which is 5lbs...whoa!!!! My buddy ordered a huge try of fries which were good but even better once dipped in the Irish curry...seriously a good dipping sauce!The actual place is kinda dark with a nice centered bar and tables surrounding it. There are TVs, but they do not turn them on until the Blackhawks or Bulls game starts so you wont get to watch ESPN or anything like that.

I started with ordering their El Diablo specialty cocktail and nothing was special about it. It just taste like tequila with juice. I tried the mule and the same goes for that. It just taste like alcohol with an off the shelf juice mix. For appetizers I tried the bacon wrapped dates with chorizo. It&#39;ll taste like a date, a bacon and chorizo. It doesn&#39;t do anything special when you wrap it up in one bite. I ordered the bomb sandwich and it was pretty dry. There were some flavors that stuck out to me. Perhaps the cumin and spices that made me want to nibble at it a little bit more. Overall I would split it with someone since it is a dense sandwich. For the drinks..

They had a huge list of craft brews available and most of their menu items were meaty and hearty, and incorporated bacon in some way. However, I thought from a taste perspective, everything just ok.   Food: We just took a couple seats at the bar and ordered some apps/food from there. Jumbo pretzel - This was a pretty huge pretzel that took up the space on an entire tray. Since it was pretty thick in a lot of places it had that really chewy, doughy texture in the center. I also thought it was a little dry on top and could&#39;ve used like butter brushed on top or something. It came with two sauces: one mustard and one cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was really tasty. It was super thick and had the consistency of like cream cheese. Sriracha wings - We all really liked their wings. We were sort&#39;ve expecting that sweet and spicy flavor that&#39;s typical with a lot of Asian style wing sauces, but this had a pretty good kick. It was on the spicier side, but not too overly hot. Bomb sandwich - I think the allure of a bacon bomb is more for its over the top nature rather than the taste itself. People just love the idea of meat wrapped around more meat. The sandwich version is basically a slice of their huge bacon bomb on a hamburger bun. I thought it was a little on the dry side to be honest. The center of the slice was ok, but the bacon on the outside was pretty dry and the meat along the edges was tough and overcooked. At the end of the day it just tasted like a regular bacon burger with barbecue sauce...nothing special.   Atmosphere: They actually had a pretty big space. When you walk in there&#39;s a large bar in the center of the room with stools all the way around, then there was separate section for tables along the wall. On the other side of the room is just a huge open area with ping pong tables and arcade games and other stuff. I went for lunch on a Saturday and there were a ton of kids and families running all over. It wasn&#39;t the atmosphere I was expecting. They also had a huge outdoor area, which looks like it could be fun once the weather gets warmer. Overall, I thought the food was just average.

kaiser-tiger-chicago-2,Jackie M.,ZgVW5D4FB-aI6nx-oNxWow,8afHY4ATcR9-1oBPlRQa6w,"Outdoor curling is such a brilliant idea to get people to go out and embrace Chicago&#39;s brutal winter. It is essentially a large shuffleboard with stones. Not gonna lie, it was really cold out, but the adrenaline rush of throwing stones and cheering each other on between blue and red kept us warm.There was a good waitlist on a Friday night, but it tapered down after 10pm. Noise level inside was just a tad too loud, but probably ok on a normal night.Food - is a tad on the pricy side. I like the concept of bacon, but they are trying to be be too upscale with the use of small plates.Bacon wrapped dates - delicious, small, had to add an extra order for 7 people.Pretzel - firmer crust, more chew than soft.Bacon wrapped shrimp - not what I had in mind! Totally embarassing to share ONE shrimp at $14. Ridiculous.Mac and cheese - meh, a bit dry and comes in a small ramekin.Whole Bomb - it&#39;s giant premade meatloaf. Comes with buns, a plate of fries and toppings (cheese/lettuce/onion). Between 6 eaters, we barely finish half of it. Cold in the center. Server brings 2 BBQ sauce - 1)Sweet 2) Spicy - both are awesome.  Thick slices of bacon envelopes this smokey, sweet bbq loaf. Love me some leftovers. Fries are not crispy at all, 3 dipping sauces are small and are just ok. Garlic aioli looked chunky.My favorite thing about KT are the impressive beers on tap. I love me a good variety of drafts, not just from small craft breweries but different styles too!

We then ordered another round after we were done playing (and we were now seated at a different table because our original table was taken). As she was coming by with our drinks, we flagged her down (to save her an unnecessary trip to the bocce ball courts), to which she replied &#34;oh thanks for moving...again.&#34; Definitely not cool, seeing as how we notified her before we moved each time and she said it was ok.

The Hot Dog was really good and I loved the pickles and onions that were on top - wish it came with some extra pickles, they are sweet and delicious. The burger was decent. They have a local habanero hot sauce, I can&#39;t remember the name of it, but it added a nice smokey spice to my burger that I liked a lot.The fries here are great too! I would recommend the cajun dipping sauce with them, it adds a nice kick.My server, Georgina, was super sweet and helpful in picking out beers. She brought me a few tasters of beers before I picked a pint, and showed me all their newest beers they had. Not only can you get a pint, but you can buy smaller sizes, like a 5oz, as well if you desire a taster with a full glass. Georgina was very personable and genuine when giving her recommendations. The beers are a good price and this is an awesome place to go with a friend or alone, plus they have a few games inside and outside of the place. The only thing that I don&#39;t reaaaally enjoy is how pricey it can get. The sausage and the burger were both $12 and it doesn&#39;t come with a side. A small side of fries is $3, which can be shared with a friend, and the first dipping sauce is free and every one after that is an additional cost.

kaiser-tiger-chicago-2,Kate P.,bSKUG8LEuQofobqry4IW-w,p-PfVbkcPpCEOfSHSF1huw,"This is a review for Kaiser Tiger as a wedding/event space. We were one of the first handful of weddings the venue held last May and we had a great experience, and I&#39;m sure they will only get smoother as time goes by. We wanted to avoid hotel venues and were looking for a more urban space that reflected our love of the city. We also didn&#39;t want to break the bank. KT fit the bill on both accounts. It&#39;s an old elevator factory (and has the the second or third oldest operating elevator in Chicago). The views of the city skyline from the upstairs event space bar are what sold us. Go there in daytime and evening - the room and view looks different each time. The location is perfect for people staying downtown or coming from the suburbs. Street parking is do-able but we didn&#39;t want our guests having to drive around hunting. KT will contract out for parking which was an additional fee. We gladly paid it, but it&#39;s something to factor into the cost. Tracy worked with us to create a great evening that started with cocktails and appetizers on the patio, the ceremony in the West Wing, and a dinner and dancing upstairs in the Skyline room. It was nice to have three different areas to move to throughout the evening. The staff even helped us get someone to dress up in full tiger gear to make an appearance during the dancing. Best part of the whole evening!I can say that Tracy literally came through with everything she had promised that evening. There wasn&#39;t one detail thing that I could say was ignored or shortchanged. It was so nice not having to worry about everything going smoothly. The staff busted their butts making sure all our guests were taken care of and several of my friends later commented on how great they were. We had 145 people total for a sitdown buffet dinner which was tight.  We had to strike two tables after dinner to make room for the dance floor. I wouldn&#39;t have minded in my 20s, but our friends were all in their 30s and older and I felt a little bad about their losing their seats.

The bar didn&#39;t seem to fit in since the the walls are rustically brick but there is a long stainless steel cooler with taps in front and on top there are a couple of random disarranged bottles of hard liquor - instead of shelves.The bartender was nice and I was surprised that he was over 21. He looked like a kid wearing jeans and a hoodie.The music was blasting top 40 tunes and pretty much the patrons looked like they were under 30. So I thought I was in Lincoln Park. On our way out, we saw they had foosball and a ping-pong table so that looks like fun.

There&#39;s an awesome outdoor space beer garden with lawn games and adequate seating for large groups. What killed me here was the terrible serving etiquette by one of their employees. My girlfriend and I went here on a Friday happy hour with a group of her coworkers. We arrived after the group had arrived and been sat at one of the long picnic tables in the beer garden. We stopped and said Hi to our group for a couple minutes and didn&#39;t see a server around, so we walked inside to the bar to order drinks. A server approached us, kind of aggressively and asked us if we were here with the group outside. We answered yes, and he proceeded to ask us if we were planning on sitting with them? Basically saying how we should order our drinks from him, without actually saying it. Super uncomfortable. At that time, we weren&#39;t planning on staying long so we proceeded to order our drinks from the bar. The group started to dwindle down and on numerous occasions there were empty drinks and people wondering where our server went. Not good service, so we decided to take our business elsewhere. The kicker is at the end of our time, he wouldn&#39;t split the bill, and actually made a comment about how one of the girls didn&#39;t tip him what he thought she should have by saying something along the lines of &#34;really? You&#39;re leaving THAT much on this bill?&#34; SUPER rude, and if he would have actually paid attention he would&#39;ve seen we had collected a cash tip for him that was perfectly reasonable based on the amount of the bill, it just wasn&#39;t going to be put on the credit card that he ran.

My boyfriend and I brought a friend here who we kept telling about their awesome patio to enjoy some beers and bocce. The inside was completely empty, and there might have been 4 or 5 groups on the patio so it definitely wasn&#39;t busy. After waiting for what felt like an excessively long time for how empty it was, we ordered beers and had a toast to a beautiful Chicago day. When one group finished up bocce, we walked over to start playing. Our friend mentioned to our server that we would be moving from our table to play so she wouldn&#39;t wonder where we were and she said it was totally cool. We played for awhile and she never came over to check on us which is okay because we were enjoying ourselves. We got a little thirsty again though and thought maybe if we sat back down we could get more beers--but our table had been given to another party. No big deal, we sat at another table nearby and waited to flag our server down to tell her we&#39;d moved yet again or ask where she&#39;d like for us to be. When we did, she responded with a sarcastic &#34;oh, thanks for moving AGAIN&#34; and reluctantly took our drink orders. When she brought the beers back to us, she slammed them down on the table and again said something rude about how we&#39;d moved. We didn&#39;t really know what else to say besides sorry... We had done our best to let her know where we were and we weren&#39;t even upset with the service--obviously it&#39;s gonna get hectic with people on a patio going to and from a game!

First, Kaiser Tiger is not just a a restaurant, it&#39;s truly an event space and I can&#39;t wait to check out their beer garden once the weather gets nice! Holding our event during the day was perfect for Kaiser Tiger because they don&#39;t open until late afternoon, we had our choice of space and the entire first floor to ourselves. The event planner, Tracy, has tons of industry experience and does not let any details fall by the wayside. We went to tour the space before committing and discuss our set-up options, which was very helpful.Concerning the menu, Kaiser Tiger has tons of options that fit everyone&#39;s needs. Although they specialize in the beer and bacon categories, all of the food we had was great. I highly recommend the garlic hummus and bacon wrapped dates to start. For lunch, our huge spread included several of their sausages, all tasty, and a &#34;Bomb.&#34; This flavorful dish is sliced and made into sandwiches. This was a huge hit amongst my coworkers. Kaiser Tiger takes a lot of pride in their handcut fries and brought them out on trays with their various dipping sauces for the group. These are a must-order, the perfect side to go with your bacon and beer.Our holiday party activity involved working with a company that rents casino tables, dealers, and all necessary materials. This concept worked great at Kaiser Tiger because the side room had more than enough space for our seven casino tables. People could play, eat, drink, mingle, it was seamless and everyone enjoyed themselves.

Our server, though friendly, forgot to put in my girlfriend&#39;s order and had her food come out when the rest of us were halfway through our meals.  He was also no where to be found when we needed refills for drinks (we had to flag him down a couple times).  At the end of our dinner when the check came around, some people paid in cash and the bf and a friend paid on a credit/debit card.  After the bf and my friend left a tip, the server collected our check and then came back to us as we were leaving to ask for a bigger tip.  Let me repeat that--HE ASKED FOR A BIGGER TIP.  Now, I understand servers make their living off of tips, but if you&#39;re not doing a really good job, why would we tip you more than you deserve?Also, this wasn&#39;t my first time at Kaiser Tiger and I&#39;ve noticed that this particular server is keen on making mistakes.

Simple meals served up on small plates hit your tongue like a firework of flavor and freshness.  I was told that the food is sourced from local, Chicago-area farms and I can only assume that this lends to its taste.  The Heirloom Tomato Bruschetta and the Sweet Corn are must haves.  Hold on, I&#39;ve got to tell you about this Sweet Corn!  Deceptively simple, it&#39;s a roasted corn on the cob covered with freshly made pesto and parmesan cheese. Yup... I have to admit it, I was still gnawing on the empty cob when it was done and tried to grab the remaining pesto/parmesan topping with my fork.  The menu is not overwhelming with a behemoth of list of complexed choices.  It is kept simple and I really like that.  For my veggie pals and &#34;non-swine eating&#34; pals out there, though limited, there&#39;s a pretty good selection of items for you.

Whether it&#39;s a table for two or a group for more, a subdued ambient setting invites the diner enjoy the place, enjoy the food and enjoy the company.  A pretty good use of space.  Check out their 2000-something cork wall on display (I think someone had WAY too much fun making that... if you know what I mean!

Everyone was approachable. Friendly. I sited my food concerns and gladly our Kristen, our &#34;guide for the evening&#34; was able to navigate me through the menu to appropriate dishes to match my need (and my palette; (please recap my bit about the Sweet Corn above).

Really good, very unique take on pizza. I&#39;ll also note that the pizza includes spicy picked cherry bomb peppers.

The waitress was attentive and friendly, and the food was good. Spirits: I don&#39;t believe that the cocktails, wines, and beers have been posted on the restaurant&#39;s website yet, but they do have a good selection of options. Most glasses of wine were priced at $11-12 and there were plenty to choose from. Menu also has several craft beers that had an average price of about $5, which seems reasonable. Most of the cocktails seemed to be $9-$10. I had the mezcal black. This cocktail was refreshing and light. Appetizers: We had the fried mozzarella and the fried bread. Both were excellent. I enjoyed the fried mozzarella the most because the flavor of both the mozzarella and crust went well together. Main meals: I had the kale caesar salad, and my boyfriend had their lamb ravioli. I loved my kale caesar because the kale was tender and the salad was well mixed. The salad was a little bit bigger than I expected, but I still ate every bit of it. I tried a small piece of the ravioli, and could instantly tell how fresh it was.",140,5,3,5,59,4.8414,2.398,0.0,13.601999999999999,No

We got a little excited and ordered a lot of food. To be fair, some of the dishes are smaller portions so it sounds like a lot but was a pretty reasonable size meal for two. Started with the parmesan cracklins. They got me with the gimmick. They&#39;re really similar in appearance and texture to chicharones, but taste like cheese. Decent if you want a crunchy snack, but they&#39;re served all by themselves so it comes off a little one dimensional. Always a good idea to get some charcuterie, so we ordered prosciutto and pork rillettes which were fine. The fall bruschetta was only OK, nothing too notable here and there are only 2 pieces per order. The 2 dishes that were really good were the beet salad and the lasagna. I wouldn&#39;t normally get a beet salad, but this was good! Different varieties of beets, pumpernickel crumbs, and lots of fresh herbs. The roasted pork lasagna was a special that night. So many layers. Cooked until it was nice and brown and crispy. Great red sauce. Overall, some hits and some misses, but I like this place. We also had an awesome server who gave us other recommendations of places to try. I&#39;m coming back for some pizza next time.",148,4,2,5,47,6.3996,3.552,0.114,16.334,No

The staff pulled out all the stops for the kids, and the Rye cocktail went down easy which took the edge off for us parents. The food was awesome.We started with the Kale Caesar which had some white anchovies and shaved parm and a housemade dressing. Before this salad, I thought it impossible to make Kale taste good. I&#39;m happy I was wrong. The pizza was a little bigger than before, which went a long way to make everyone happy. The sausage on the pizza was really moist and well spiced - the perfect amount of fennel. The Carbonara could not have been any better. It had Cacio e pepe levels of fresh cracked pepper which I loved, but if you&#39;re shy when it comes to pepper, you may want to have the kitchen hold off. The fresh pasta taste and texture was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had.

If I am paying $42 for a bottle of wine, I would expect it to at least be consumable. We knew we were in trouble when our waitresses twisted the cap off. I literally got sick from one glass of wine and could have no more, and my wife couldn&#39;t even stomach a half a glass. We left the rest of the wine untouched. Its very disappointing when you pay $40 over face value for 2 buck chuck. The food: We opted for the pork rillettes, bleu cheese, tagliatelle with veal meatballs, and sausage pizza. Bleu Cheese: It tasted good, however for $6 we got about $0.03 worth of cheese. It was the tiniest sliver I have ever seen on a cheese plate.Pork Rillettes: This was actually pretty good, I slathered it all over the bread we were given which was also decent. This was the best thing we had all night.Tagliatelle with Veal meatballs: Very, very disappointing dish. I knew with my first bite that the meatballs were frozen not fresh, and likely bought in bulk from a food supplier instead of being made in house. Remember the good ole college days when you&#39;d buy a bag of 40 frozen meatballs and throw those in the oven to go with your pasta? Yea, those tasted better. The pasta in itself was all right, but the sauce had absolutely no seasoning at all, very bland. And to pay $15 for 3 bites of pasta and frozen meatballs? Highway robbery. Sausage Pizza: The serving again was very small, 3 slices each and there was not much sausage on the pizza. I would have been happier with a home run inn sadly. All in all, the food is about on par with what you would expect to find at a dive bar in the middle of Kansas, and they are charging mid to high end dining prices for it. We felt ripped off paying over $100 for what we were served. This place is in desperate need of a call from Robert Irvine.

Would definitely go back for a number of reasons:1) Atmosphere: the place is decorated nicely with a rustic wooden feel with modern fixtures. They&#39;re taking cues from all the popular restaurant decors it feels like, but for good reason. It just feels nice to eat in places like this.2) Staff: our server Alex was funny and attentive and made sure our needs were handled without feeling pushy like some servers do. The hostess was sweet and checked in on us as well. To top it off, our waters were always filled quickly if they were low.3) Beer: a solid list of about 15-20 good bottled craft beers accompanied the standard domestics with Hamm&#39;s being their preferred &#39;cheap&#39; beer at $3/can.4) Food: my friend and I split two pizzas. The sausage and the prosciutto. Both were so delicious. The prosciutto had a white sauce of sorts and some amazing peppers to add a bit of kick to it. The sausage was flavorful and the red sauce had just a hint of sweetness. Both were thin crust. I could have probably eaten a whole one by myself so they&#39;re perfect for a personal pizza or to split and have a little bit leftover.

I wouldn&#39;t order that again. I was really looking forward to their homemade fettuccine in carbonara sauce- sadly the noodles seemed a little over cooked and the entire dish was way too salty.

We weren&#39;t being crazy, we were three 40+ year olds watching a basketball game.  There was a child two tables over, and no one from that table ever once looked at us, and even at the admission of the manager, they hadn&#39;t complained abut our cursing.

ugos-kitchen-and-bar-chicago,Z. Z.,Ylh0bTlLjZsv9fIa7qPXEw,0XLnl3jxuo9-nPKaa4qbDg,"This place definitely has a few kinks to work out. The portion sizes for some of the dishes are comical - there were literally 3 raviolis on the plate - and it was billed as an entr’©e. the bruschetta had 2 pieces of bread (although the toppings were piled high, the bread was the size one would expect from a baguette). The radish salad was also measly, with just 5 radishes and barely any goat cheese. While the sizes were questionable on the aforementioned items, the taste was pretty good (but not mind-blowing) on the remaining items. One big downfall was the lasagna - at least half was burnt. The pizzas were tasty, with the squash being absolutely outstanding. Take a pass on the margarita pizza - it&#39;s pretty boring and there are better choices on the menu. The pizza dough was pretty good - not &#34;cracker like&#34; (that&#39;s GREAT in my book), but still thin, without that burn taste that so many wood fired pizzas tend to have (which, by the way, I do not like). Some of the other guests with me ordered the sausage pizza, which they seemed to like, but I didn&#39;t personally taste (I don&#39;t eat pork). We also had the celery root salad - unfortunately we shared it 6 ways, because I would have liked to have more. What I had of that salad was pretty good and I enjoyed the two different preparations of celery root.While the cocktails are absolutely worth the wait, the service is painstakingly slow. They seemed to only have one bartender at the time and the place had quite a few people (not packed, but still busy). I think the cocktail was black mezcal (if not, then black was in the title and mezcal was in the drink) - that one is the one to order. First I ordered something else, but it wasn&#39;t for me (maybe someone else would have liked it more - it was very strong. I was looking for something lighter to enjoy with apps). Hopefully they work out the kinks - and fast. The portion size needs to be increased - and maybe that means a price increase. I don&#39;t think that would be a bad thing. For example, the ravioli I mentioned was made of lamb. Lamb is a personal weakness of mine. I would probably pay more for a nice plate of lamb ravioli rather than pay less for a skimpy portion. The bruschetta size, though, was inexcusable. The restaurant should give more food for bread and veg - those ingredients aren&#39;t expensive. Vegetarian friends will have a tough time finding food here. If they&#39;re OK with pizza, they should be fine. If they&#39;re looking to get something else, there&#39;s only one entr’©e and a handful of apps. The menu is pretty small in general - which is smart, since they&#39;re just starting - but be knowledgeable about what you&#39;re walking into.Overall, I&#39;d say that I&#39;ll look forward to keeping my eye on the place. I wasn&#39;t &#34;wowed&#34;, but they&#39;re still new. Hopefully they work out some of the issues I mentioned. The rest of the items (ambiance, service) were definitely up to par - if not better, so the place has potential.",333,3,3,5,65,7.091300000000001,4.552999999999999,1.541,26.905000000000005,No

Unfortunately, I walked away disappointed. The menu has a limited selection, which is fine if the few items are well executed. I had a pizza, lasagna and the kale Caesar. Everything was under portioned given the price point. The kale Caesar was the best item we ate - quite tasty.  The pizza was very underwhelming. I was expecting something twice the size. The ingredients were fine just sloppy.  The lasagna was ordered because of lack of selection and came out room temp and lacked flavor.  It&#39;s new.

They have a selection of sandwiches, pancakes and wraps, and most importantly for breakfast, OMELETTES! which are a fusion of Mexican cuisine and American favorites. They have cactus, chorizo, chilaquiles, etc. The concept is great, the execution was underwhelming. The eggs in my omelet were dry, the bacon didn&#39;t seem freshly fried. They brought the food out literally 3 min after ordering, as if it was waiting for us before we came there. Plenty of bland sauce.  The potatoes were pretty good, not gonna lie. Also for toast they have this butted white bread, the best part of the brunch. Coffee was ok, I&#39;d say 6/10 fyi bowtruss is now across the street now, if I come back I&#39;d get my coffee there first",108,3,2,5,20,4.0963,1.995,0.0,10.005,No

I opted for the Huevos Rancheros for brunch.  The dish came with two eggs, breakfast potatoes, tender pieces of pork, and tortilla shells.  I liked that the breakfast potatoes, and pretty much the whole dish was non greasy.  I liked the sauce, but I wish it had been a tiny bit spicier.

We walk in look around wait for anyone to come and greet us.  It never happened so we find a table and sit down.  I walked up to the counter to ask  if the seating in the back had bigger tables. The lady I spoke with said that area was not available and she could put two tables together which never happened. I ordered a banana milk shake 18th street burger sweet potatoe fries to share. My friend orders the stuffed turkey burger with spinach and cheese.  The milk shake comes out first.  It looks like milk.  I tasted it and asked if that was the way it normally looks the server takes away and say she will fix it.  The server brings it back and it has more banana mix but it still is looks and tastes like 2% milk with a banana powder.  The burgers are supposedly hand crafted why then would you ever have a mix for a shake? Certainly not worth $4.00.  The burgers came out it looked good.  My friend asked if the cheese was stuffed inside the burger? The servers response was I guess so.  My friend cuts the burger open and there is nothing  stuffed about the stuffed burger.  My friend tells the server there is no spinach or cheese in the stuffed burger.  The servers was very argumentative and said she ordered a stuffed burger with no spinach.  Even if that was the case the burger was not stuffed with anything. The server offers to take the burger back still arguing she ordered a stuffed burger with no spinach. Had that been the case the burger still had no cheese and was cooked incorrectly. This very bold and ignorant server decided to say out loud where we could hear her that she knows we order a stuffed burger with with no spinach. Who does that. Never the less we got up and asked for the bill we were so done. I was pissed. Then the server gives me the bill. This server put the banana milk back on the bill and it became $4.25. I said are you nuts I said didn&#39;t like the drink said I didn&#39;t want it and your also charging for a non stuffed burger. At that moment I wasn&#39;t paying thing my friend insisted that we pay the bill and just leave. She&#39;s a really nice person. I sent them a face book post and said as a waitress you work for tips and your customer service was horrible. Well I got a response that was topical sorry and went on to say the severs repeat all the orders. Well they erased it from  Facebook so I want to let everyone now this is not cool. The food I had was not good at all. Fries are to be cooked at 300 degrees other wise they absorb the oil resulting gross soggy oily fries. You should know that and a milkshake is made with ice cream and has a thickness to it. I had to give 1 star to right this review. The manager or owner said I should have given them an opportunity to make the situation right but that was 3 strikes with the food right there. Customer service is not enforced at all.

It is unfortunate but we have to use our best judgement and try things out for ourselves to truly get a clear picture of what is going on.  I have been to this restaurant for a number of meals, from breakfast and lunch to just having apps for an event.  I am finally writing my review.  I really have enjoyed the food, the setting is intimate and I love the bright ambiance.  The restaurant is fairly new and some of the kinks are still being worked out -like dealing with the air conditioning and its quirks.  The food is so delicious.  I have had their tacos, huaraches, pizza, burgers, french fries, and they have not dissappointed.  I had their chilaquiles most recently after a fun night out with the green sauce and it was so delicious and not super spicy.  I Love, Love, Love their potatoes.  Whether you are ordering french fries, or their different breakfast taters, they are right on mark.  This is a family run restaurant and not one that has been around for decades.  The family team are still working out the challenges that come with running a new business, from weather changes, to the influx of guests at any given time.  Some considerations have to be had.  In the 6 times I have visited, I have not been disappointed.  I go for the delicious, fresh and homemade food, I love the different art they display, I enjoy the wholesomeness at the restaurant and did I mention the food is food that I love with creative twists that take it from good to really delicious meals.  Keep up the good work.

The atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable. Music choice was PERFECT. The only problem was it was too cold for me.

Hopefully he&#39;s there when we go back because we&#39;ll def be back. Our table was wobbling which kinda bothered me but not so much when the food came. Lol. The food was good. I had the crab legs, potatoes and corn, with the 3 the chi way seasoning which was BOMB. Also had the shrimp with the jerk seasoning. I felt like my corn was over cooked because wit was too soft. But the potatoes and crab legs were cooked to perfection. The shrimp I think they should cut the back open so that the seasoning can get inside the shell. We really didn&#39;t taste the jerk on the shrimp unless we dipped it after we peeled it. But the jerk sauce was good with the shrimp. Not too hot, just right. There&#39;s a wash station in the back, which I like the idea, so u don&#39;t have to run to the bathroom.

However, there are several small changes that could be made to make this wonderful restaurant a long term success-1. Take out should be available at all times. You are losing substantial revenue and customers by having a cut off time for take out. It is worth it to hire staff to make this happen. The long term benefits outweigh the short term savings.2. Enhance your lighting, this is a fun restaurant where you eat with your hands. The lighting at night makes the restaurant too dark and serious.3. Waitresses should make more than one stop at a table, and should not be seen laughing and joking around to the point that customers have got to wave 2-3 minutes to get their attention. Perhaps a partition at the back of the restaurant, where they prep would help this. On positive note I loved the fact that the owner came out to talk to customers and asked how their experience was.

Luckily for most of us, it is a new neighborhood restaurant. One that many of us have longed to have in the area, however, this place delivered even more than what we could have desired. This place is definitely up there with Angry Crab and Low country ,but, has easy parking and a very laid back atmosphere. Perhaps, better. The food was amazing. Everything was seasoned to perfection! We chose the fried oysters and the chicken wings. The chicken wings were pretty good but the seasoned fries were even better. I would go with the BBQ wings over the buffalo. Next, we all decided to order our own bags of seafood. One pound was enough for one person. I also shared the sausage, corn and the potatoes. They were also very good and seasoned. All and all this place is worth a try. It is small, so be prepared to wait or go on an off day. We even were able to meet the owner and the manager was very accommodating. The entire staff were very informative and responsive to our requests. Oh and how could i forget, it is a BYOB. They do NOT charge a corkage fee. It is a great place, please try it out!My only complaint is that they charge a 20% gratuity on checks for groups of 5 or more. I am pretty sure that is a practice that you cannot do in the city of Chicago anymore. Furthermore, we would have left even more than 20% because our club prefers to over tip but when practices such as these occur, we typically only pay what is charged. Either way, I will go back!",179,4,2,5,16,6.4765,5.78,0.653,19.567,No

two-fish-chicago,Matthew P.,hGuuVj6eXy7Ats7W30GXqQ,M6piAJJAjogHW7Ky9BfRxw,"Could&#39;ve been 5 stars easily... The review you want to read!If you don&#39;t want to read the following, here&#39;s the review in short, &#34;Service &amp; Small things lacking, food quality and taste is not, but it doesn&#39;t make up for the problem areas&#34;Food Quality: The seasoning and ingredients in their broil was delicious! We ordered the &#34;3 the chi way&#34; and it was great! Not too much heat or bite, just enough and it was delicious! We also ordered a fried catfish and fries, the fried catfish was great as well! We did not order the seasoned fries, the fries that came with the catfish were the same basic fries that most other fast food restaurants have at Harold&#39;s, they lacked any taste and were bland. For a restaurant like this, EVERYTHING, should have your taste buds screaming, not &#34;some stuff&#34;. I recommend just serving seasoned fries.The hostess upon my request, told me what they were out of before we sat, due to my overhearing someone being told that they were out of crab. The hostess told us that they were out of king crab and snow crab. I came there specifically for the king crab. I was also disappointed to see that they did not serve whole lobsters.The crawfish and peel and eat shrimp was delicious with the temperature and flavor we ordered. The problem that I have is that in the bottom of the bag were little &#34;clippings/chippings&#34; of the crawfish. I did not like this one bit and I felt as if this could&#39;ve been easily avoided if the kitchen paid closer attention. I&#39;ve had lowcountry boils at all the other a Chicago restaurants (Angry Crab, lowcountry, etc) and this did not happen. Please stop doing this. If a strainer was used, this wouldn&#39;t have happened. the lobster tail also was not sliced open like other establishments to make for easier eating king crab/lobster.The lobster tail was good, very good with the 3 the chi way&#34;The BAD: SERVICE!It was a party of two on a Saturday night around 8:30pm. It was not that busy, almost all the tables were filled. They had a hostess that appeared to be a it overwhelmed, she needed some assistance, we were left waiting at the door for approximately 6-7 minutes until she arrived back, we were promptly seated after that. Our server (she had pigtails) did not appear enthusiastic to serve or upbeat. Neither did the other servers. She was polite nevertheless. Unfortunately, we barely saw our servers, which I found to be odd because it&#39;s only approximately 15-17 tables in the establishment. There was a male with ear rings walking around, presumably one of the managers, we asked him for bibs and she&#39;ll utensils, he never brought them over. We asked for them again by our server and it we timed it, it took 8 minutes to bring them to us, so we&#39;re sitting at the table with all our food in front us and couldn&#39;t dive in because we lacked utensils, a bucket, or bibs. Our server failed to check in on us, we didn&#39;t see her until we asked for or Bill. Which I found to be unacceptable, especially due to the small size of the establishment. The guy in the denim jeans and black shoes, presumably the manager seemed to be doing a lot of moving around, however, instead of checking on our table, or maybe others, he was busy making the ladies laugh and being a people pleaser instead of serving or directing the servers accordingly. In comparison to lowcountry and angry crab, we had I&#39;ve had a great service experience with diverse servers with upbeat and pleasant attitudes, that frequently assured that we had what we needed. The owners at lowcountry were especially nice and were friendly, made us feel like guests in their own home.Food wait time - It took over 40 minutes for our food to reach our table. The manager brought it to us. Compared to other similar establishments in the chicagoland area, this was excessive, even on a busy night. We received our food within 15-20 minutes.Specialty offerings - Very basic, fried seafood options. However, unlike others that have DELICIOUS SIDE ITEMS like beignets and or garlic noodles like other establishments. Recommendations: Training with waitstaff on service delivery or perhaps get new waitstaff, keep the hostess dedicated to hostess duties - not running back and forth to the kitchen and helping serve tables (she helped us with a few things due to or server being MIA), purchase those steel corona buckets and Keep them at the tables for shells, and get rid of those cheap water Rubbermaid water pitchers that some tables had (we asked for one from the hostees during our meal, we never received it) - buy a bunch of the clear glass 1 liter bottles with swing tops from homeGoods or elsewhere, they&#39;re $5-$10 each. Many restaurants that I&#39;ve dined in supply tables with 1-2 of them, they&#39;re fancy and alleviates having to stop the server for water refills. Oh, don&#39;t run out of food, particularly the food that people come here to eat! I intend on returning, this place has GREAT potential! I&#39;d be a regular! Keeping my dollars black is always nice!",555,3,1,5,-6,6.1419999999999995,5.043,2.496,38.46099999999999,No

I asked for the owner, she came out and her customer service was TERRIBLE!!! I feel she was being very unprofessional. I told her that I had never been to a restaurant and was not pleased and they didn&#39;t try to accommodate customers. (I was not trying to get anything free, I just didn&#39;t want a specific food and felt I shouldn&#39;t have to pay for it. I did not eat any of it or touch it .)

The food is always fresh and full of flavor. The restaurant is a great addition to Bronzeville and I love the family friendly atmosphere as my little girls love crab and seafood. My favorites are the Crab bag with corn and potatoes seasoned Three the Chi Way and I can&#39;t not have the fired catfish. Come out and support and I promise you will not leave disappointed. #TeamTwoFish",56,5,1,4,4,3.3461000000000003,1.6980000000000002,0.0,4.3020000000000005,No

oriole-chicago,Jordan M.,Q78yoP89c4EWYjUEzju9tA,Tw-Y4AP48cmAd4iXl6HhVQ,"I don&#39;t even know where to begin because everything at Oriole was AMAZING. The food, the service, the ambiance - all of it was impeccable. Let&#39;s start with the food. Oriole does a tasting menu for all of its diners with dishes that regularly rotate. We had about 14 courses. My favorites were the caviar, the beef tartare, the scallop, and the wagyu. The caviar was paired with the most amazing herbs that set off the caviar perfectly. The beef tartare was seasoned to perfection and was served with this amazing bone broth with Vietnamese flavors. The scallop was served with an amazing uni foam / broth, cauliflower, and apple. Now I know this particular pairing sounds weird, but trust me it WORKED. Finally, the wagyu was just solid, perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth beef. It was served with an interesting charred lettuce with sesame. The only dish I didn&#39;t like was the spring roll. The herbs were slightly overpowering in the dish. The service was also amazing. Everyone who worked there went above and beyond to make sure the night went well. Dishes were brought out promptly and explained in detail. Servers were on top of drinks / wine pairings. And most importantly, the staff attempted to personalize everyone&#39;s experience. Our server even went so far as to volunteer to keep an eye out for our Uber driver for us when we were done with dinner so that we wouldn&#39;t have to wait outside. I also loved the ambiance. The open kitchen is amazing. It&#39;s fun to be able to see the chefs at work and to watch the magic happen. I also loved that the restaurant was small - I think it seats about 30. It was nice to eat in a restaurant that wasn&#39;t overly crowded, where you could actually have a conversation without yelling at each other. And lastly, now this is weird, but I loved their bathroom. They had these amazing smelling candles and the best hand soap and lotion. They also stocked the bathroom with eucalyptus face wipes, hair spray, breath mints, and other fancy items. Oriole definitely lives up to its reputation and its two Michelin stars are well deserved. I will for sure be back! (After my wallet recovers that is.)",242,5,2,5,48,11.4962,6.393,0.386,23.221000000000004,No

Furthermore, I&#39;m not a food critique, I just love food in my own ways and with my loved one, so take my review with a heavy scoop of salt.Now that&#39;s out of the way, let me take you to a journey that blew everything I knew about fine dining out of the water.First of all, Oriole is kept in a secret location, hidden by a large elevator door, in a forgettable neighborhood. But, once you enter this mysterious establishment, guided by a friendly staff waiting outside the door, you will be taken to a culinary fantasy realm, fit for a foodie&#39;s dream. What&#39;s so great about this place? Well, everything. The service is incredible, the staff very knowledgeable and friendly and they&#39;ve even served the one-single wine pairing in two separate wine glasses (totally unheard of). They allowed my fianc’©e and I to take numerous flash photographs of our meals and even let us take pictures with the chefs at the end of the meal before surprising us with complimentary dessert.All of this, and I haven&#39;t even described how every portion of the meal was perfect and brought forth aspects of my senses that I never knew existed.Of the three fine dining experiences during my Chicago vacation (Grace and Alinea included), Oriole took the cake (my pre-wife had my heart already).",202,5,2,5,43,5.779400000000001,2.455,0.069,9.476,No
